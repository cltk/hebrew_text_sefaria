This is a penalty imposed by the Rabbis on the Jew who violated [the prohibition of] \"thou shalt not see nor shall it be found\" so they forbade it even if he left it accidentally or under unavoidable circumstances so that no one would keep chametz around on Passover in order to use afterwards.

A proof to this matter is what is stated in the Torah: (Shemot 34:25) \"Do not slaughter the animal with hametz in your possession.\" This means to say do not slaughter [the korban pesach] while the hametz exists. The day of the slaughtering the korban pesach is the 14th day following midday.", "1": "...And what is this removal that is mentioned in the Torah?

In addition, it is a Rabbinic injuction to search and destroy hametz on the night of the 14th using a candlelight, since people are usually home and the candle is excellent for searching. One should not establish his learning at the end of the 13th day.

Pass out grains and nuts to them and clear the table from in front of them before they have eaten and grab matzah from each others' hands, and things like these.

And thus start with telling that we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and all of the bad things that he did to us and finish with the miracles and wonders that were done for us in our freedom.
