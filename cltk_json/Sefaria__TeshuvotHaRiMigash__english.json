Additionally, they have attributed some of the responsa to those who did not author them. Moreover, many Geonim ruled one way in their responses to a question and later retracted that ruling or were challenged on it by others.", "2": "If someone whose primary knowledge is from these responsa, and he does not understand what of them is correct and what is not, may he issue rulings on a matter or in a case, basing his ruling on it? Is it not possible that the author of the responsum from which he ruled retracted his ruling? So may one who does not understand the principles of a law or its source in the Talmud issue rulings? Is he worthy of reliance on any matter, especially if he is not God-fearing, and there has been testimony of his many evils? Moreover, they have testified of him that one day he bases his ruling on one responsum, attributing it to a particular ga\u2019on, and the next day, in a similar case, he bases his ruling on a different responsum, attributing it to a different ga\u2019on. Please, master, explain to us the letter of the law on this, with ample explanation.", "3": "Response: Know that this man is more worthy of permission to issue rulings than many people who have established themselves as decisors nowadays, though most of them do not even have one of these two things, that is, understanding of halakha and familiarity with the opinions of the Geonim. Those who presume to rule based on close study of halakha, on the strength of their study of the Talmud, are the ones who should be prevented from [issuing rulings], because nowadays there is no one worthy of this and no one who has attained, through the wisdom of the Talmud, the status of those who may issue rulings based on their own study, without familiarizing themselves with the opinions of the Geonim. ", "4": "However, one who issues rulings based on the responsa of the Geonim and relies on them, even though he cannot understand the Talmud, is more proper and praiseworthy than one who thinks he knows the Talmud and relies on himself. For even though his ruling is based on untrue reasoning in prooftexts from the Geonim, he is nevertheless not mistaken about this, because he is acting based on what was done in accordance with a large court that serves the public expertly. But one who issues rulings based on his study of halakha might think that a particular law demands are particular practical ruling when in fact it does not, and his analysis or interpretation was mistaken. Nowadays there is no one who will reach, through the Talmud, the status of one who is reliable to issue rulings from it.", "5": "I have already seen the responsa of some people, on matters about which they ruled. They think that they issued proper rulings, and that the matter is clear as day, but in fact they issued mistaken rulings, basing the matter on a source that is not the proper source, deriving a law from a place that should not serve as precedent for this. There was a very fine distinction between the case they judged and the law on which they based their ruling, but it was concealed and hidden from them, and they did not notice. They took the law at face value and did not sense the fine distinction in it, then they compared the case they addressed to that law, without sensing the subtle difference between them.", "6": "Ultimately I say that one who does not rely on himself, if he relies on the responsa and rulings of the Geonim, which are settled law and clear, concise reasons, he is more praiseworthy than those who deign to issue rulings straight from the Talmud.", "7": "However, that which you have mentioned that he is not God-fearing, if he is a permanent judge, it is worth investigating this, because it is not becoming of us to appoint a judge who is not impartial. This would be like planting an tree used for pagan worship (asherah) in Israel. If he is not a permanent judge, and the only people he adjudicates are those who accepted him by means of selection, we should not prevent it. \n"}, "12": {}, "13": {}, "14": {}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {}, "2": {}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {}, "23": {}, "24": {}, "25": {}, "26": {}, "27": {}, "28": {}, "29": {}, "3": {}, "30": {}, "31": {}, "32": {}, "33": {}, "34": {}, "35": {}, "36": {}, "37": {}, "38": {}, "39": {}, "4": {}, "40": {}, "41": {}, "42": {}, "43": {}, "44": {}, "45": {}, "46": {}, "47": {}, "48": {}, "49": {}, "5": {}, "50": {}, "51": {}, "52": {}, "53": {}, "54": {}, "55": {}, "56": {}, "57": {}, "58": {}, "59": {}, "6": {}, "60": {}, "61": {}, "62": {}, "63": {}, "64": {}, "65": {}, "66": {}, "67": {}, "68": {}, "69": {}, "7": {}, "70": {}, "71": {}, "72": {}, "73": {}, "74": {}, "75": {}, "76": {}, "77": {}, "78": {}, "79": {}, "8": {}, "80": {}, "81": {}, "82": {}, "83": {}, "84": {}, "85": {}, "86": {}, "87": {}, "88": {}, "89": {}, "9": {}, "90": {}, "91": {}, "92": {}, "93": {}, "94": {}, "95": {}, "96": {}, "97": {}, "98": {}, "99": {}}, "originalTitle": "\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\"\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05d2\u05d0\u05e9", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Teshuvot HaRi Migash", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
