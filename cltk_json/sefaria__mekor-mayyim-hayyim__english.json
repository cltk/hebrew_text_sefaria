Therefore when a certain thing breaks or is lost he should not worry at all, for he has elevated what was relevant to him and therefore it broke; and when it is lost and comes to another [person\u2019s possession], presumably that thing also contains holy sparks that are also relevant to that person. Therefore when he has elevated from this what he needed, the thing came to another [person\u2019s possession] for him to elevate what is relevant to him.\u201d And see also in Vayikra, p.40b.", "3": "In the book Be\u2019er Mayyim Hayyim, \u201cExplanation of the Haggadah\u201d s.v. Grievous in the eyes of the Lord etc., he wrote: \u201cThe Ba\u2019al Shem Tov, may he be remembered for life in the world to come, said: \u2018Three who ate at a single table and did not speak words of Torah over it are like those who ate sacrifices of the dead\u2019 (Avot 3:3) \u2013 the explanation is that the deceased person is reincarnated in human food, so that words of Torah will be spoken over him, and through this he will bring to life that deceased person who was in this reincarnation; but if they do not speak words of Torah, then he has sacrificed that deceased person who was reincarnated in this food and cast him into lifelessness, and that is why they said \u2018sacrifices of the dead.\u2019\u201d"}}}
