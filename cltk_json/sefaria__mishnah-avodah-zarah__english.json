Regarding a city which has idolatry within it, and has both ornamented and un-ornamented shop fronts, this was the case in Beit Sh'an, and [there] the Sages said: The ornamented shops are forbidden and those shops without ornamentation are permitted.", "4": "It is forbidden to sell the following items to non-Jews: pine-cones, white figs and their stalks, frankincense, and white chickens. Rabbi Yehuda says: one is permitted to sell them a white chicken amongst a group of chickens; and if it is alone he must clip its toe and sell it, since they do not sacrifice blemished animals for idolatry. As for all remaining items, if [their intention was] not specified one is permitted [to sell them], but if specified, it is forbidden.

And they [the Sages] said: [It was proposed that] a priest with a good disposition may burn [a burnt offering after sucking out the fat from its stomach] while it it still raw [and has not yet been burnt with the offering, which would forbid one form deriving any benefit from it]. And they [the sages] did not agree with him [who proposed this opinion], but they said: One may not derive benefit [from the fats of the stomach], nor is one [who does so] liable for <i>meilah</i> [deriving prohibited benefit from from a sanctified object].\" [Implying that one should therefore not be liable for the less stringent case of a stomach of carrion.] He [Rabbi Yehoshua] retracted, and [instead] said, \"Because they curdle it in the stomachs of calves that were used for idolatry.\" And he [Rabbi Ishmael] said, \"If so, why is there no prohibition to benefit from it?\" He [Rabbi Yehoshua] redirected him to another topic. He said to him, \"Ishmael, my brother, how do you read (Shir HaShirim 1): 'For <i>dodechah</i> [Heb. masc: \"your love\"] is better than wine,' or 'For <i>dodayich</i> [Heb. fem: \"your love\") is better than wine'? He said to him:, \"'For <i>dodayich</i> is better than wine.'\" He said to him, \"The matter is not so.

He said to him: one does not respond [to halakhic questions] in the bathhouse. When he left, he said to him:  \"I did not come into her territory; she came into my territory.  They did not say [when they built this bathhouse]: 'Let us make a beautiful bathhouse for Aphrodite.'  Rather, they said: 'Let us make Aphrodite for the beauty of the bathhouse.' Another reason: [even] if they gave you a lot of money, you would not enter before your idolatry naked and defiled and urinating in front of it.  Yet she stands on the sewer pipe and the entire nation urinates in front of her.

Rabbi Yose the Galilean said (Deuteronomy 12:2): \"Their gods upon the mountains,\" but the mountains are not their gods; their gods \"upon the hills,\" but the hills are not their gods. And why are Asherah trees forbidden? Because humans hands were involved in [planting] them, and any [idolatrous] thing that human hands were involved in is forbidden. Rabbi Akiva said: I will expound [the verse] and rule before you, everywhere that you find a tall mountain, a raised hill, or a verdant tree know that there is idol worship there.", "5": "One whose house abuts [a house of] idolatry, and [his own house] collapses, it is prohibited to rebuild it. How should he proceed? He should gather it four cubits into his own [space] and build. If it [the wall that collapsed] belonged both to him and to the [house of] idolatry, the [respective] law applies to each half [and only his own half may be rebuilt]. The stones, wood, and dust [of a house of idolatry] have a ritual impurity like that of vermin [i.e. through contact], as it says (Deuteronomy 7:26): You shall utterly detest it. Rabbi Akiva says: like that of a menstruating woman, as it says (Isaiah 30:22): \"You will banish them like a menstruating woman. \u2018Get out!\u2019 you will say to it.\u201d Just as a menstruating woman renders objects impure through carrying, so too does idol worship render objects impure through carrying.", "6": "There are three [types of] houses. A house that is initially built for idolatry: this is prohibited. If it was painted and the molding was put in for idolatry, or if it was renewed [for idolatry], what is new is removed [and the rest is permitted]. If idols are brought inside and removed: this [house] is permitted. There are three [types of] stones. A stone initially hewed to be a pedestal [for an idol]: this is prohibited. If it was painted or molded for idolatry, or renewed [for idolatry], what is new is removed. If an idol was erected on top of it and removed: this [stone] is permitted. There are three [types of] <i>asherot</i>. A tree initially planted for idolatry: this is prohibited. If it was pruned and trimmed for idolatry and it sprouted, the new growth is removed. If an idol is erected under it and taken away: this [tree] is permitted. What is an <i>asherah</i>? Every [tree] that has idolatry below it. Rabbi Shimon says: Every [tree] that is worshiped. It happened in Tzidon, regarding a tree that was worshiped, that they found below it a pile of stones. Rabbi Shimon said to them: \"Examine this pile.\" They examined it and found an image. He said to them: \"Because the image is what was worshiped, we shall permit the tree for them.\"", "7": "One should not sit in its shade, but if one did sit he is pure. One should not pass beneath it, and if one did pass he is impure. If it encroaches on the public [domain], one who passes beneath it is pure.

If one stoked the oven with it: if [the oven] is new, it must be shattered; if old, it must be cooled.  If one baked bread in it, it is prohibited for benefit. If [the bread] became mixed up with others, they are all prohibited for benefit.  Rabbi Eliezer said: Let him cast [a sum equivalent to the worth of their] benefit into the Dead Sea!  They said to him: There is no redemption when it comes to idolatry.  If one took wood from it for a loom, it is prohibited for benefit. If he wove a garment with it, the garment is prohibited for benefit.

The bimusioth of kings [hewn stones fixed on the road for the king as pedestals for idolatry, so that when he passes by there he may bow down to it] are permitted because they are placed there when the kings pass by. The Gemara explains: \"Because they place it down.\" That is, they are not fixed there for all times, but only when the kings pass by.

This is forbidden of a certainty. 2) a flavor which is unsalutary from beginning to end, such as that of (forbidden) fish fats or (forbidden) flesh in honey. This is permitted ab initio. 3) a flavor that is unsalutary in the beginning but salutary in the end, such as (forbidden) honey in wine, which spoils it at the outset, but which lends it aroma and flavor once the wine gains ascendancy over it. 4) a flavor that is salutary in the beginning, but unsalutary at the end, such as that of the fats of flesh with butter or that (i.e., the flavor of) a vessel, not (used) on the same day, which (flavor) when it entered was salutary, and later became unsalutary. These (last) two are forbidden out of doubt. Therefore, if these grits into which vinegar fell were not boiling, they are forbidden out of doubt. For vinegar in (unboiled) grits is (at first) unsalutary and (then) salutary.
