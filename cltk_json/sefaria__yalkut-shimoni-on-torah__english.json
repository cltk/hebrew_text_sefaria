And what is the meaning of \"like Hashem our G-d whenever we call upon Him,\"--calling upon Him is by the festivals, as it is said, \"These are the festivals of Hashem, a holy calling.\" Rav Krispa said in the name of Rav Yochanan: in the past, these were the festivals of  Hashem; from now on, it is as you call them. If you call them, they are My festivals, and if not, they are not My festivals. \"This month is for you\"--you count according to it and the nations of the world do not count according to it. Rebbi said in the name of Rabi Yehuda bar Ilai: the way of the world is that the greater count according to the greater, and the smaller count according to the smaller. Eisav, who is greater, counts according to the sun, which is greater, and Yaakov, who is smaller, counts according to the moon, which is smaller. Rav Nachman said: it's a good sign; the greater one rules during the day and does not rule at night, so too the wicked Eisav rules in This World and does not rule in the World to Come. The smaller one rules by day and by night, so too Yaakov rules in This World and in the World to Come. Rav Nachman said: all the time that the light of the greater one shines, the light of the smaller one is not noticed; when the light of the greater one sets, the light of the smaller one is noticed. So too as long as the light of Eisav is shining, the light of Yaakov is not noticed; once Eisav's light sets, the light of Yaakov is noticed, as it is said: \"Arise and give light...\" This month [is the first of months:] Rav Shmuel bar Abba said, every month that is begun from six hours or less, the eye has power to see it. From six hours or more, eyes have no power to see it. And the month that Hashem said to Moshe [Nisan 2448] was begun from above six hours, and no eye could see it; but Hashem showed it to him with a finger and said to him, \"this month....\". Rav Acha said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani: the year that Yisrael left Egypt, the months of the year and the months of the period were equal. Rav Chiyya said in the name of Rav Yochanan: Hashem wrapped Himself in a talis with tzitzis and stood Moshe here and Aharon here, and called to Michael and Gavriel, and He made them as if they were the witnesses of the new moon. He said to them: how did you see the moon? Before the sun or after the sun? To its north or to its south? How much was it tilted, and how wide was it?--He said to them, according to this order [of questioning] your children will be sanctifying the month Below; through an elder and through witnesses and through a talis with tzitzis...", "8": {"0": "...

Rather, this is what Moshe said \u2018I gave many commandments to Israel which cannot be fulfilled except in the land.

Why did the verse mention them separately? To permit private altars between the two. Inheritance refers to Jerusalem, as its says \u201cMy inheritance was to Me like a lion in the forest\u2026\u201d (Yirmiyahu 12:8) and it says \u201cIs My inheritance to Me a speckled bird of prey?\u201d (Yirmiyahu 12:9) These are the words of R\u2019 Yehudah.

What does the resting refer to? The resting of the ark, as it is written \u201cAnd now, arise, O Lord God to Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your might\u2026\u201d (Divre HaYamim II 6:41) The opinion that both refer to Jerusalem makes sense, because while the Tabernacle was at Shiloh private altars were permitted, as it is written \u201cAnd Manoah took the kid goat and the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock to the Lord\u2026\u201d (Shoftim 13:19)  But the according to the opinion that both refer to Shiloh, then private altars were forbidden while the Tabernacle was there and how do we understand Manoah\u2019s act? It was a temporary injunction. The House of R\u2019 Yishmael taught like the opinion of R\u2019 Shimon bar Yochai that both refer to Jerusalem, and your sign is: one man pulled many to him\u2026"}}}
