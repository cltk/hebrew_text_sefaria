Rashi. And the Rab did not explain what about the fire. And in Gemara (Zevachim 46:b) is said: To exclude unfinished burning, and explains here that we sacrifice on condition to place it over the campsite burning fire, not to place it over the coals that chill and go dim. And I see that it needs to be consumed completely over the fire, and not to let a small leftover, and it relates to a rebellious son issue (Sanhedrin 70a): Like midcooked thieve's meat; (Eruvin 29b)Neither cooked nor consumed. And there are some that explain there:  To exclude unfinished burning, his intention was to place over wood fire, as it is written over the fire on the wood, and not over straw fire nor mulch fire, as we learn (Shabbat 36b): finished oven with straw and mulch. And behold, in this sacrifices verse is said  fragrant fire to God.

This is the language of Rashi. But in Sefer Vayikra, there is only a phrase of \"You should be separate\". And they learned there (Chapter 12:3), That the people should be holy because Hashem is holy and the people should be separate as Hashem is separate. According to my opinion, the separation is not from sins of sexual transgression, like the rabbi (Rashi) says. Rather, the separation should occur in any place that we are separate. The issue comes when the Torah warns of sexual transgressions and forbidden foods, the Torah also allows sexual relations between husband and wife and allows eating of meats and wines. Therefore, a desirous person will take advantage and have multiple wives or will be a savage when it comes to drinking wine and eating meat. He will do as he pleases because there is no prohibition in the Torah. However, he will be a scoundrel in the permissions of the Torah. Therefore, the torah comes to mention specifically after the prohibitions, the general rule or law that we should be separate from the permissible areas of the Torah.

Moreover, Rabbi Akiva has ruled that \u201cYour life comes first.\u201d   The Torah here enjoins us that we should wish upon our neighbor the same benefits that we wish upon ourselves.  Perhaps, this is the reason for the dative instead of the accusative form of the verb phrase; we find the same in \u201cAnd you shall love him as yourself\u201d (19:34).  Indeed, sometimes a person may wish upon his neighbor certain benefits, but only wealth, not wisdom and the like.  But even if he wishes his cherished friend well in everything, i.e. wealth, honor, learning, and wisdom, he will not do so unstintingly; he will still insist on a larger share of the benefits.  It is this shortcoming that the Torah condemned.  Rather, a man should wish his fellow well in everything, just as he does in his own case, and he should place no limitations on his love. Therefore, in the case of Yonatan and David (I Shemuel 20:17), it says that Yonatan \u201cloved him as his own soul,\u201d since he had removed all jealousy from his heart, declaring \u201cAnd you shall rule over Israel\u201d (ibid. 23:17)."}, "2": {}, "3": {}, "4": {}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "2": {}, "3": {}, "4": {}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "originalTitle": "\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\"\u05df \u05e2\u05dc \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Ramban on Leviticus", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
