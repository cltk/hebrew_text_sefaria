That is why it states that he is completely exempt - that he is not volunteering in the way of those that make an oath of their own volition. Since, if he came to make a vow [about] fig cakes, he should have used the term, <i>konam</i> (an introductory expression indicating a vow not to do or use something) which is the [standard] way of those that make vows. (Tosafot)", "And if you will ask: And behold, he said, \"Nazerite;\" and [so] how could he be in [standard, non-Nazerite] vow; one can answer that, 'Nazerite' is a term of separation, as if he said: \"behold I am separating from cakes of figs.\" And even though Rabbi Yehuda holds that he said, \"a sacrifice\" without [the letter,] <i>kaf</i>, (which means 'like'), he would not be taking a vow on a sacrifice, [since] when he says, \"upon me,\" he doesn't need the <i>kaf</i> (to indicate that it is only like a sacrifice and not a sacrifice itself)."]}}
