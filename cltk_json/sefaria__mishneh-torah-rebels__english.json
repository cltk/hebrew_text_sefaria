When he disputes any law of the laws with the large beit din, and does not rescind his words in favor of the decision of the beit din, rather he continues to argue against them and continues to teach and to act against their decision, the Torah has decreed upon him death.  If he confesses, he has a place in the World to Come.  Even though he is a judge and they are judges and he has received the tradition just as they have, the Torah has given them the measure of honor.  If the beit din wanted to forego their honor and let him live, they may not, so that disputes will not be plentiful among the people Israel.", "1": "If there were an outstanding sage, on of the court that disagreed and repeated his own position and taught it to others, but did not teach them to do as he says, he is exempt; As it says \"the man that does it on purpose\" It does not say 'the man that says it on purpose' rather it emphasizes that he must instruct it to be done or do it himself."}}}
