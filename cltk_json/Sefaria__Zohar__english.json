Hiya said: \u0091It is written, \u0093God maketh the earth by his strength\u0094 (Jer. X, 12). He who \u0093maketh the earth\u0094 is the Holy One, blessed be He, above; \u0093by his strength\u0094 means by the Zaddik; \u0093he establishes the universe\u0094, this is the earth beneath; \u0093by his wisdom,\u0092, refers to Zedek (justice). Also it is written, \u0093makes the earth\u0094, and not \u0093made\u0094, because God constantly regulates the earth and its activities through the agency of His \u0093strength\u0094, as just explained... \u0091 R. Isaac said: \u0091It is written, \u0093By the word of the Lord the heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts.\u0094 The \u0093heavens\u0094 mentioned here are the lower heavens, which were made by the word of the upper heavens, through the spirit which sent forth a voice until it reached that stream which issues and flows perennially. By \u0093all their hosts\u0094 is meant the lower world, which exists through that \u0093breath\u0094, which is male. A similar lesson is derived from the verse, \u0093Who watereth the mountains from his upper chambers, the earth is full of the fruit of thy works\u0094 (Ps. CIV, 13). The \u0093upper chambers\u0094 we have already explained, and the term can be further illustrated by the verse, \u0093Who lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters.\u0094 The expression \u0093the fruit of thy works\u0094 alludes to that stream which ever flows and issues forth; hence it is written, \u0093Yielding fruit whose seed is in it,\u0094 as explained.\u0092\n", "2": {"0": "...

There is a reference not only to his own journeying, but also that of the Schekina, who always went with Jacob, and therefore we learn that every person needs to be male and female at all time, for the sake of his faith, he ought not to think or imagine that the Schekina forsakes", "2": "him in any way.
