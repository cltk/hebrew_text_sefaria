And also when it challenges nearby, \"Why did you see to learn it from, 'Whoever strikes an animal;' let it be learned from, 'Whoever strikes a man'\" - [if the teaching was really based upon juxtaposition,] what is the difficulty; is it not based upon juxtaposed phrases, and \"Whoever strikes a man\" is not juxtaposed to \"If a man gives!\" And if you will ask, and since it learned it from a scriptural connection [and not from] juxtaposed phrases, why was it forced to bring the verse of \"The one who mortally strikes an animal shall make it good,\" and discard the verse of  \"Whoever strikes an animal\" that it brought above; one can answer that \"Whoever strikes an animal\" was needed for the teacher of the House of Hezkiah - and for the one that does not [agree with that teacher], he expounds [it] in the beginning of [the chapter called] Hanechenakin (Sanhedrin 84b), \"Just like 'Whoever strikes an animal' for medicinal purposes is exempt, etc.\" And also (another answer) is that once it retracted \"Whoever strikes a man,\" which is with the death penalty, it retracted it completely. And [instead] it took this verse of \"The one who mortally strikes an animal\" which is juxtaposed to \"\"If a man gives a blemish.\" And according to this, we are able to include [the words], \"juxtaposed to it is\" - since because it is juxtaposed to [the other verse], it took this verse, but not because of [the exegetical tool of] juxtaposed phrases.
