The priest sounds a Tekiah, a Teruah, and another Tekiah (cf. Rashi on v. 5)! So, too, in the case of \u201ccalling the assembly together\u201d, he blows a Tekiah, a Teruah and a Tekiah, so that it follows that there is no difference between the signal for \u201ccalling the assembly\u201d and that for the \u201cjourneyings of the camps\u201d.

In order to intimate: It was I who distinguished in Egypt between one who was a firstborn and one who was not (cf.

He was envious of the princely dignity held by Elzaphan the son of Uziel whom Moses had appointed prince over the sons of Kohath although this was by the express command of God (Numbers 3:30). Korah argued thus: \u201cMy father and his brothers were four in number \u2014 as it is said, (Exodus 6:18) \u201cand the sons of Kohath were [Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uziel]\u201d. \u2014 \u201cAs to Amram, the eldest, his two sons have themselves assumed high dignity, one as king and the other as High Priest; who is entitled to receive the second (the rank next to it)?

He replied to them: \u201cIt is subject to that law\u201d. Whereupon they began to jeer at him: \u201cIs this possible?

He said to them: according to the custom of the heathens there are numerous forms of divine worship, and consequently numerous priests, for they cannot assemble for worship in one temple; we, however, have One God, one Ark, one Law, one Altar, all constituting one form of worship and therefore we need but one High Priest; \u2014 and you, 250 men, all demand the High Priesthood?!

It was on this account that he warned them by saying, And it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord will choose is the holy one \u2014 he is already in his state of holiness (not \u201che will become holy\u201d; he thus warned them that there was not the slightest likelihood that they would be chosen).

However, the family of \u05d0\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3 (mentioned there) had ceased to exist by now. The same was the case with five families of the tribe of Benjamin, for with ten sons did Benjamin go down to Egypt and here it enumerates only five. Similarly with Ezbon of the tribe of Gad. So you have seven families that had become extinct (cf. Tanchuma). \u2014 And I have found in the Jerusalem Talmud the reason why these seven families were now extinct: that when Aaron died the clouds of glory departed and the Canaanites came to wage war against Israel. These therefore set their hearts on returning to Egypt and turned back eight stages from Mount Hor to Moserah, as it is said, (Deuteronomy 10:6) \u201cAnd the children of Israel journeyed from Bene Jaakon to Moserah; there Aaron died\u201d. But did he not die at Mount Hor and from Moserah to Mount Hor there were eight stages in a backward direction? But the explanation is that they turned back, and the Levites pursued them to force them to return and slew of them seven families. And besides these, of the sons of Levi there fell four families: the families of Shimei and Uzzieli, and of the three sons of Izhar (Exodus 6:21) only the family of one son, Korah, is enumerated here, v. 58, so that the family of Izhar may be regarded as extinct \u2014 making three families missing. And as regards the fourth family I do not know which of those mentioned in 3:21, 27, 33, it was that had become extinct by now (Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 1:10; Yoma 1:1). But Rabbi Tanchuma explained that they (the families not mentioned here) died by the plague in the matter of Balaam. But this can hardly be so, because according to the deficiency that shows itself in the tribe of Simeon in this census, as compared with the first census in the wilderness of Sinai (1:23), it would appear that all the twenty four thousand who died of that plague (Numbers 25:9) must have fallen from the tribe of Simeon.", "9": "\u05dc\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9 OF OZNI \u2014 I say (cf.

But as for those who were born from that time and onwards their families were not called by their own names, except the families of Ephraim and Manasseh, both of whom wore born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin (v. 40). And I have found in the work of R. Moses the Preacher why this was so in the case of the two latter \u2014 that their mother went down to Egypt when she was already pregnant with them so that they may be regarded as being among those who went down to Egypt, and on this account they formed separate families, just as Chamul and Chezron who were grandchildren of Judah (v. 21), and Cheber and Malkiel who were Asher\u2019s grandchildren (v. 45). If this is an Agada, well and good; but if not, then I say that Bela had many grandchildren and that from these two, Ard and Naaman, there issued from each a large family, and the offspring of the other sons were called after Bela\u2019s name, but the offspring of these two were called after their name. So, too, I say about the sons of Machir who formed two different families, one called after his name, and one called after the name of Gilead, his son, because it was a very large family. Five families are missing from Benjamin\u2019s sons as stated before: here (i.e., by the fact that five of the families had become extinct) there was fulfilled part of his mother\u2019s prophecy which is alluded to in the fact that she called him Ben Oni (my unfortunate son), (Genesis 35:18), whilst by the incident of the concubine in Gibea (Judges 20:35), the whole of it was fulfilled for practically the entire tribe was exterminated.

Although the portions were not of equal area because, as we have now said, in all cases they assigned the portions according to the size of the tribe, yet they did so only by aid of the lot, but the lot fell by the utterance of the Holy Spirit, as is explained in Baba Bathra (122a): Eleazar the Priest was clothed with the Urim and Thummim, and spake by the Holy Spirit, \u201cIf such-and-such a tribe comes up, such-and-such a territory shall come up with him\u201d. The names of the tribes were written on twelve tablets, and those of twelve districts on twelve tablets. They mixed them in an urn, and the prince of a tribe inserted his hand in it and took out two tablets. There came up in his hand the tablet bearing the name of his tribe and the tablet relating to the district that had been declared by the Urim and Tummim to be intended for it.

Another explanation is that the form of \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u201ccausing to pass\u201d is exceptionally used in the case of a daughter being her father\u2019s heiress because a daughter as heiress ordinarily causes the inheritance to pass from one tribe to another tribe, since her son and her husband are her heirs (Sifrei; Bava Batra 147a), for it must be born in mind that the command (Numbers 36:7), \u201cThe inheritance shall not move from tribe to tribe\u201d was laid only upon that generation (Bava Batra 120a). And so, for the same reason, we have this verb used in (v. 8): \u201cThen ye shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter\u201d, for you see that in all of them (the other cases mentioned here) it says, \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05dd, \u201cand ye shall give\u201d (vv. 9, 10, 11), but in the case of a daughter it says, \u05d5\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05dd, \u201cand ye shall cause it to pass\u201d."}, "6": "\u05dc\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea\u05d5 TO HIS KIN THAT IS NEXT TO HIM OF HIS FAMILY \u2014 The term \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d7\u05d4 used in connection with inheritance denotes kinship only on the father\u2019s side (Bava Batra 119b).", "7": "\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd GO UP INTO [THIS] MOUNT ABARIM \u2014 Why does this follow immediately here? Because when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, (v. 17) \u201cThou shalt surely give them an inheritance in the land\u201d he (Moses) said, \u201cIt is me that the Omnipresent has commanded to apportion the inheritance. Perhaps then the decree that I must die in the wilderness is annulled and I shall enter the Promised Land!\u201d Whereupon God said to him, \u201cMy decree remains exactly as it was\u201d (Tanchuma). \u2014 Another explanation: As soon as Moses entered into the territory of the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben (the eastern side of the Jordan, which, having been assigned to these tribes, might be regarded as part of the Promised Land), he rejoiced, saying, \u201cIt seems to me that the vow regarding me has been annulled in my favour\u201d. God, therefore, said to him, My decree remains exactly as it was. A parable! It may be compared to the case of a king who decreed against his son that he should not enter the door of his palace. He (the king) entered within the gate, and he (the son) went after him (without the father raising any objection); to the audience chamber, and he after him. But as soon as he was about to enter his sleeping-chamber (his private room) he said to him, \u201cMy son, from here and further on you may not go\u201d (Siphre).", "8": "\u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d0\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05da [THOU SHALT BE GATHERED TO THY PEOPLE] AS AARON THY BROTHER WAS GATHERED \u2014 From this it is evident that Moses longed for a death similar to that of Aaron (cf. Rashi on Numbers 20:26). \u2014 Another explanation: you will die as he died (in the wilderness) because you are no better than he (Tanchuma). \u2014 Such indeed is suggested by (Deuteronomy 32:50. 51): \u201c[and die \u2026 as Aaron thy brother died \u2026] because you sanctified me not\u201d. Thus it follows, if ye (both of you) had sanctified me your time would not have yet come to depart this life and you would not have died in the wilderness (Siphre). In every passage where it writes about their death you will find that it writes about their offence. Because a decree had been made against the generation of the wilderness (those who left Egypt) that they should die in the wilderness on account of the sin that they did not have faith in God, therefore Moses requested that the nature of his offence should be stated in the Torah, so that people might not say, \u201cHe, too, was one of those \u201crebels\u201d. A parable: It may be compared to the case of two women who were punished by the Court; one was an immoral woman and one had merely eaten unripe figs of the sabbatical year\u2019s growth. The latter, therefore, requested that the nature of her offence might be made public, and they did so by proclamation. So, too, here: wherever it mentions their death it mentions also their misdeed, in order to make it known that there was only this single sin in them (Tanchuma \u05d7\u05e7\u05ea; Yoma 86b; cf.

(It is a \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u05f3, a sin offering for a sin known only to God). And that the same applies to other goats (i. e., that they atone for uncleanness under the same conditions) we derive from the law about this goat. \u2014 But its Aggadic explanation is as follows: The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \u201cBring an atonement offering for My sake, because I diminished the size of the Moon\" (cf.

And an explanation of it in the Agada is: because on all the seven days of the Festival they offered sacrifices corresponding in number to the seventy nations of the world, and they propose then to set forth on their way home, the Omnipresent says to them: \u2018I beg of you make a small banquet for Me, so that I may have some pleasure from you exclusively\u201d (Sukkah 55b).", "4": "\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 ONE BULLOCK, ONE RAM \u2014 these are an allusion to Israel who form one nation: \u201cStay with me a little longer\u201d.

Such is the opinion of R. Ishmael (Siphre). What it means is: since up to now we have the words of the Omnipresent to Moses (Numbers 28:1\u20142: \u201cAnd the Lord said to Moses, \u2018Command the children of Israel, etc.\u2019 \u201d) and the chapter about vows that follows begins with an utterance of Moses (\u201cAnd Moses spake\u201d), it is necessary first to make a break by stating that Moses in turn told this section to Israel (\u201cAnd Moses told etc.\u201d), for if this were not done it would imply that he did not tell them this section about the sacrifices, but began his address with the chapter about vows.", "1": {"0": "\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05d8\u05d5\u05ea [AND MOSES SPAKE TO] THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL] \u2014 This does not mean that he spoke only to the princes of the children of Israel and not to the people also, but that he showed respect to the princes by teaching them first and that afterwards he taught the children of Israel. This explanation seems to assume that this was the general method of instruction, but from what Biblical verse may we infer that this was so in the case of all addresses, and that this was no exceptional case? Because it says, (Exodus 34:31\u201432) \u201c[And Moses called unto them], and Aaron and all the princes of the congregation returned unto him and Moses spake unto them; and afterwards all the children of Israel came nigh, [and he gave them all the commandments which the Lord had spoken to him in Mount Sinai]\u201d. But if this be no exceptional case, what reason is there for Scripture going out of its way to state it here? Because by specially stating that the laws about vows were taught in the first instance to the princes and afterwards to the Israelites, it intends to teach that the annulling of vows is really to be effected by one person who is expert in the Law, and that only if there be no such expert, may they be annulled by three ordinary persons. But you may perhaps say that the statement does mean that Moses spoke this section only to the princes of the children of Israel, and that Moses did not speak to them also, and that consequently nothing about the expert and laymen can be inferred! But it is stated here, \u201cThis is the word\u201d, and it is stated in the passage dealing with \u201canimals slaughtered outside the sanctuary\u201d (Leviticus 17:2) \u201cThis is the word\u201d. What is the case there? It was addressed to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel, as it is said there, \u201cSpeak unto Aaron [and unto his sons and unto all the children of Israel]\u201d!

Another explanation of \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 THIS IS THE WORD: it is a restrictive phrase serving to intimate that the Sage (the expert) makes use of the expression \u201cinvalidating\u201d (\u05d4\u05ea\u05e8\u05d4), and the husband (dealing with his wife\u2019s vows), only of the expression \u201cannulling\u201d (\u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4), as is the language of Scripture here (e. g., in v. 9), and that if they (one of them) exchanges the expression, it (the vow) is not invalidated nor is it annulled as the case may be (Siphre; Nedarim 77b)."}, "2": {"0": "\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8 A VOW \u2014 This is when one says, Behold, I take upon myself an obligation which is as sacred to me as an offering, that I will not eat, or that I will not do such-and-such a thing. \u2014 One might think that if he swears that he will eat the flesh of an animal which has not been slaughtered properly according to the rite that I may apply to him the text, \u201cHe shall do according to all that goeth forth from his mouth\u201d!

How is this so? Three lands are situated to the south of the Land of Israel, one next to the other; part of the land of Egypt, and the whole land of Edom, and the whole of the land of Moab. The land of Egypt is at the south-west comer, as it is said in this section, (v. 5) that the southern boundary shall pass \u201cfrom Azmon unto the Brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea\u201d (i.e., at the west). Now the Brook of Egypt ran along the whole land of Egypt \u2014 as it is said, (Joshua 13:3) \u201cFrom the Shihor which is before Egypt\u201d, and divided the land of Egypt from the land of Israel. The land of Edom is next to it on its east. The land of Moab is next to the land of Edom at the end of the south side of Palestine at the east (i.e., the south eastern corner). \u2014 When Israel came out of Egypt if the Omnipresent had wished to bring about their entry into the Land quickly, he would have led them over the Nile northwards and they would have so come into the Land of Israel; but He did not do so. This is what is stated, (Exodus 13:17) \u201cAnd God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines\u201d who dwelt by the sea in the west of the land of Canaan \u2014 just as it is said of the Philistines, (Zephaniah 2:5) \u201cinhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites\u201d. \u2014 However, He did not lead them by that route, but He made them travel round, and brought them out by a southern route into the wilderness. It is that which Ezekiel (Ezekiel 20:35) calls \u201cthe wilderness of the peoples\u201d, because several peoples dwelt beside it. Then they proceeded along the south always from the west to the east, until they came to the south of the land of Edom. They asked of the king of Edom that he should permit them to pass by way of his land and to enter the land of Palestine along its (Edom\u2019s) breadth. He, however, refused, and they were compelled to travel along the whole south of Edom until they came to the south of the land of Moab, as it is said, (Judges 11:17) \u201cAnd also to the king of Moab he sent, but he refused\u201d. Therefore they proceeded along the whole south of Moab unto its very end, and from there they turned their faces to the north until they had gone along its entire eastern boundary along its breadth. Wien they arrived to the end of its eastern side, they came upon the land of Sihon and Og who dwelt at the east of the land of Canaan with the Jordan dividing them (dividing the land of Sihon and Og from Canaan). This is what is stated in the history of Jephthah, (Judges 11:18) \u201cThen he (Israel) went through the wilderness and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the east of the land of Moab\u201d. They subdued the land of Sihon and Og which was on the north of Moab and they approached right up to the Jordan, which was opposite the north-west corner of the land of Moab.
