(Leviticus 16:1) On the first day of the Holiday, read the Chapter of Times in Leviticus (Leviticus 23). And on the other days of the Holiday, read the Sacrifices of the Holiday. (Numbers 29)  Ribbi Jacob Son of Ahi said in the name of Ribbi Yesa \u201cThis is to teach you that the world does not stand, except through the sacrifices.\u201d  It was taught over there (Fathers 1:2) \u201cSimon the Righteous was of the remnants of the Great Assembly. He had said \u2018On three things the world stands: 1) On Torah, 2) on Worship, 3) and on Distribution of Piety.\u2019\u201d \u2028\u2028And the three are mentioned in a single verse (Isaiah 51:15) \u201cAnd I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.\u2019\u201d\u2028\u2028And I have put My words in thy mouth: This is the Study of Torah.\u2028And have covered thee in the shadow of My hand: This is Distribution of Piety, to teach you that whosoever engages in Torah and in Distribution of Piety merits to sit in the Shade of the Holy One, Blessed be He.
