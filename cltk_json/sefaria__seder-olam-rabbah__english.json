Enoch buried Adam, and lived after him 57 years. Methuselah exhausted his days just before the Flood. From the Flood to the division [of languages] was 340 years. Noah lived ten years after the division [of languages]. Our father Abraham was at the division [of languages] 48 years old. Rabbi Yosei said: Eber was so great a prophet that he called the name of his son Peleg by the Holy Spirit."}, "1": {"0": "... The judgment of the wicked in Gehinnom lasts twelve months, as it says \u201cAnd it shall be from new moon to new moon\u2026\u201d (Yeshayahu 66:23) R\u2019 Yochanan ben Nuri says: from Pesach until Atzeret (Shavuot), as it says \u201c\u2026and from Sabbath to Sabbath\u2026\u201d (ibid.) After twelve months the souls of the sinners of Israel who transgressed the Torah and the commandments are consumed and their bodies are consumed and they are turned to dust. Gehinnom spits them out and the wind scatters them underneath the feet of the righteous, as it says \u201cAnd you shall crush the wicked, for they will be as ash under the soles of your feet\u2026\u201d (Malachi 3:21) But those who separated from the ways of the community, like the Sadducees, and the betrayers and the hypocrites and the heretics, and those who \u2018spread their terror in the land of the living,\u2019 and those who denied the resurrection, and those who say Torah is not from heaven, and those who scoff at the words of the Sages \u2013 Gehinnom is locked before them and they are judged there forever, as it says \u201cAnd they shall go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against Me\u2026\u201d (Yeshayahu 66:24) Not only this, but the netherworld will cease to be but they will not cease to be, as it says \u201c\u2026and their form will outlast the grave as his dwelling place (zevul).\u201d (Tehillim 49:15) From His dwelling place He will wear out their form, and their form will wear out the netherworld. What caused this to happen to them? Because they stretched out their hands against the dwelling place, as it says \u2018as his dwelling place,\u2019 and there is no dwelling place other than the Holy Temple, as it says \u201cI have surely built You a house to dwell in\u2026\u201d (Melachim I 8:13)"}}}
