But no matter how much food a woman eats or how much liquid she drinks, the fetus is not expelled - is this not \"life and lovingkindness?\"   Rabbi Simon said, the womb of a woman is made with many cavities, many coils, and many bands.  At the moment that a woman sits on the birth chair, (the baby) does not get cast out all at once. There is a saying, \"If one band is loosened, two bands are loosened\".  Rabbi Meir said: All nine months that a woman does not see blood, she really should have seen it.  What did The Holy Blessed One do?

As it is stated (Exodus 1:5): \"And all of the people [nefesh] that were of Jacob's issue, etc.\" Because Esau worshipped many gods, it is written many \"souls,\" but for Yaakov--who worshipped one God--it is written one soul, \"And all of the people [nefesh], etc.\""}, "30": {}, "31": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": "...\u201cThe son of of an Israelite woman went out\u2026\u201d This is like what is written (in Ecclesiastes 4:1) So I returned, and considered all the oppressions done under the sun, and behold the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter.

Offended, the man stood up, and grabbed Rabbi Yannai by the coat! He then said: My inheritance is with you, and you are withholding it from me! Said Rabbi Yannai with puzzlement: What legacy of yours is there with me? He replied: Once I passed by a school, and I heard the voices of the little children saying: 'Moses gave us the Torah, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.' They did not say 'the inheritance of the congregation of Yannai,' but the 'congregation of Jacob.' Rabbi Yannai asked, \u201cHow then are you worthy to eat at my table?\u201d The guest replied, \u201cNever have I heard an evil word spoken against me and returned to argue with the person who spoke it. Never have I seen two people arguing without making peace between them.\u201d Rabbi Yannai then said, \u201cyou have so much Derech Eretz and I called you a dog.\u201d On him rabbi Yanai said the verse \u201cAnd there is a path\u201d \u2013 meaning not one, but two paths take you to salvation \u2013 since rabbi Ishmael son of rav Nachman said: Derech eretz precedes Torah by 26 generations, since it is written \u201cand to guard the way to the Tree of Life\u201d (Genesis 3). \u201cWay\u201d is the derech eretz, and only after that comes \u201cTree of Life\u201d which is Torah.
