Note that these customs have not been observed for a very long time, probably already from the time of the Talmud, and may not have even been observed in the times of the Mishnah itself.", "1": "Explanation<br> According to the mishnah a virgin is married on Wednesday so that if the husband wants to make a claim against her that she was not a virgin, he can come directly to the court which sits on Mondays and Thursdays and make a claim against her. If his virginity claim against her is accepted by the court, he may divorce her without paying her the ketubah. The chapter will continue to discuss the issue of virginity claims and how the judge is to adjudicate them. Note that virginity claims are already mentioned in Deuteronomy 22:13-22. The virginity of the bride was of high value in the ancient world and a man who thought that he was marrying a virgin but found that she was not had the right to claim that he had mistakenly married her. The mishnah does not state why widows are married on Thursday. This will be found later in the Talmud.", "2": "Shmuel asks why the Mishnah says that a virgin is married on the fourth day. Now we should note that his very question is puzzling\u2014the Mishnah already stated why a virgin is married on Wednesday! The Talmud will ask this question soon. For now the answer is that we need a certain day to determine when a virgin is to be married so that we can know when the husband is obligated to feed her. A mishnah in the fifth chapter teaches that if the time for marriage comes and they are not married, she eats his food and if he is a Kohen, she may eat terumah. Let\u2019s say they set the first of Adar as the wedding date. But the first of Adar falls on a Tuesday. In such a case the husband\u2019s obligation to sustain his wife does not begin until Wednesday, for she would only be married on Wednesday. Furthermore, if she is married to a Kohen, it is from this date and onwards that she can begin to eat terumah, the food that only a priest may eat.", "3": "R. Joseph now raises a difficulty on the very statement that he himself transmitted in the name of Shmuel. [This is a strange phenomenon]. The difficulty seems to be that Shmuel used a source that was not taught [in the Mishnah] to explain another source that was taught [in the Mishnah]. However, even this difficulty is wrong. What Shmuel had really done is take one mishnah from the fifth chapter of Ketubot and used it to explain our mishnah from the first chapter of Ketubot. Therefore the Talmud rephrases his difficulty. Shmuel has used a mishnah that already has an explanation (our mishnah in the first chapter) and explained it with another mishnah that doesn\u2019t have an explanation. This too is not such an easy difficulty\u2014after all, the other mishnah is self-explanatory. Nevertheless, in tomorrow\u2019s section we will see a rewritten version of Shmuel\u2019s statement. If you\u2019re wondering why this sugya seems to say so many things that do not make sense, it may be that it has been redacted or reedited so many times that the original meaning of Shmuel was lost in the shuffle. This is typical of sugyot at the beginning of tractates.", "4": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section the chapter opened explaining why virgins are married on Wednesday. Our section continues to discuss the subject.", "5": "This reworded statement of Shmuel is basically the mishnah: A virgin is married on Wednesday so that if her husband wishes to make a virginity claim, he can go to the court the next day. However, this version adds a difficulty. If virgins are wedded on Wednesday so that their husbands could come to court on Thursday with a virginity claim, then why not let them be married on Sunday and come to court on Monday. After all the court sits twice a week\u2014Mondays and Thursdays.", "6": "Virgins are not married on Mondays because that would not leave enough time after Shabbat to prepare a proper wedding feast.", "7": "This now connects up with the earlier statement made by R. Joseph, but expands on it. If the time to get married arrives on the first day of the week, he does not feed her until the fourth day of the week. Furthermore, we learn a precedent from that case. If for some reason they cannot get married (illness or menstruation) then he need not give her food. Note that this is true even if he is sick and therefore the delay in marrying her is his fault. With regard to menstruation, women who were menstruating used to postpone their marriages because they could not have sex. Nowadays, weddings are no longer delayed for this reason.", "8": "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday\u2019s section we learned that if the husband or the wife delayed the wedding because of illness or menstruation, he must begin to provide her with food as soon as the date set for the wedding has passed. Today, the Talmud says that this is a question.", "9": "The Mishnah (in chapter five) clearly stated that if he has to wait a few days to marry her until Wednesday, he is not obligated to feed her until Wednesday. Note that this is at most a week\u2019s delay. The question posed here is whether this is a precedent for other types of delays. If he can\u2019t marry her because he is sick is he exempt from feeding her because in here too he was prevented against his will from marrying her. Or are the two cases different?", "10": "The Talmud now advances the question. If we say that if he became sick he has to provide her with food, because the delay in marriage was his fault, what if she became sick? Perhaps he could say to her that he is ready to get married, and that the delay is her fault. Therefore, he would not be obligated to provide for her. Or perhaps she could say to him in essence, tough luck. \u201cYour field was flooded\u201d\u2014nothing you could do about it, but you lost out.", "11": "The Talmud now advances the question one final step. If illness might be considered his tough luck and therefore he would have to provide her with food, what about a case where she begins to menstruate and therefore has to delay the marriage? If she menstruates at her regular time, there is no doubt she cannot say to him, \u201cYour field has been flooded\u201d because she could have known that she was going to begin to menstruate. This was expected and therefore cannot simply be considered his bad luck. But what if she menstruates at an irregular time\u2014can she say to him, \u201cYour bad luck\u201d or might this be considered the same situation as menstruating at a regular time since not all women menstruate with regularity?"}, "1": {"0": "The mishnah uses the passive voice \u201cthey were not married\u201d and not the active, \u201cThey did not marry them.\u201d This means that even if the delay comes from the women, they still receive food from their husbands. However, the question is what sort of delay? If the women intentionally delayed the marriage, why should they eat of his food? That would not be fair at all. Therefore, it must refer to a situation where they were forced to delay the marriage. Nevertheless, even though the delay was due to the women, the husbands must provide them with food.", "1": "R. Ashi rejects R. Aha\u2019s precise reading of the mishnah. He holds that only if the husband delays the marriage must he provide her with food. If the woman delays the marriage, the husband is not liable to provide for her until she is ready. The reason the mishnah used the passive, thereby referring to the woman, is to preserve the subject of the beginning of the mishnah which reads, \u201cThey give a virgin 12 months to get ready for the wedding.\u201d Since the passive was only used to preserve the parallel with the first clause, we cannot read anything into its use.", "2": "Introduction<br>In the previous sugya we learned that if the husband was prevented by force (such as illness) from marrying his wife, he need not provide her with food. Thus we take situations of \u201cforce\u201d (a person was prevented from doing something not of his choice) into account. The question in our sugya is whether or not force is taken into account in matters of divorce. The sugya will explain what this means.", "3": "According to Rava when it comes to divorce we don\u2019t take issues of \u201cforce\u201d into account. The Talmud will now give us some situations where this issue arises.", "4": "The Talmud now tries to find an earlier source for Rava. The first source is a mishnah that teaches that if a husband gives his wife a get and says to her that it will be valid only if he doesn\u2019t return within twelve months, and then he dies within twelve months, the get is not valid because he did not return. The Talmud tries to derive from this mishnah what the rule would be if he didn\u2019t come back because he got sick (\u201cforce\u201d). The mishnah said it\u2019s not a get if he dies\u2014but if he doesn\u2019t come back because he was sick, then the get would be valid. From here we could learn that \u201cforce\u201d is not taken into account in matters of divorce. However, this derivation is not certain. It could be that the mishnah uses the example of death to teach us that death cannot occur after divorce. If this is what the mishnah teaches us then we could not deduce from it that if he is sick, the get is still valid.", "5": "The Mishnah already taught that there can be no divorce after death in an earlier mishnah. This would free up the mishnah of \u201cif I do not return within twelve months\u201d to teach that only death would prevent the get from being valid. If he doesn\u2019t return due to illness \u201cforce\u201d then the get would be valid.", "6": "The Talmud now posits that the mishnah about \u201cIf I don\u2019t return within twelve months\u201d was meant to teach against the ruling of \u201cour rabbis\u201d who said that the effectiveness of a document is set by its date. For instance if a man writes \u201cthirteenth of Nisan\u201d in his document but then says it won\u2019t be operative until later, the document goes into effect on the thirteenth of Nisan. The mishnah rules against this position\u2014if he says \u201cafter twelve months\u201d then he meant to divorce her only after twelve months. Since that mishnah was needed to rule against this position of \u201cour rabbis\u201d it is not possible to use it prove that if he was prevented by \u201cforce\u201d the get is valid. This leaves us with no proof of Rava\u2019s overall position that \u201cforce\u201d is not taken into account. The argument continues in tomorrow\u2019s section.", "7": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues searching for a source for Rava\u2019s rule that we don\u2019t take \u201cforce\u201d into account when determining the validity of a get. As we saw what this means is that if a husband says his get will be valid if he doesn\u2019t return within a certain period and then something happens that prevents him from returning the get is valid. The fact that it wasn\u2019t his choice not to return (he was \u201cforced\u201d not to return) is not taken into account.", "8": "The mishnah says that if the husband makes such a statement and then dies before he can make it back to his wife within the twelve months the get is valid. At first the Talmud assumes that the same would be true if he grew ill. This would prove Rava\u2019s point\u2014we don\u2019t take cases of \u201cforce\u201d into consideration when determining the validity of the get.", "9": "Again the Talmud rejects the above deduction. Perhaps she is divorced only when he dies, for we could assume in that case he did not want her to be subject to the laws of levirate marriage (marriage to her dead husband\u2019s brother in a case where the husband had no offspring). As an aside, this is why men sometimes would have written conditional gets. If they divorce their wives before they die, then the wife would not be liable for levirate marriage. Being subject to marrying his brother may not have been so desirable.<br>In any case, if the husband got sick and was prevented from returning within twelve months, he would have wanted to stay married to her. So therefore in this case it would not be a valid get. Again, we have failed to find a source for Rava\u2019s ruling.", "10": "Here the Talmud finds a story as proof that we don\u2019t take \u201cforce\u201d into account.  Even if it is obvious that he wanted to return, if he\u2019s not back, it doesn\u2019t count. Shmuel states this explicitly. This would serve as a perfect source for Rava\u2019s general rule that we don\u2019t take \u201cforce\u201d into account.", "11": "The Talmud now distinguishes between a regular case of \u201cforce\u201d that could have been anticipated, and an unusual case. The case of the ferry not being able to cross over is a regular case. The husband should have stipulated before that if the ferry caused his delay, it would count as if he had returned. But the case of being sick is not regular. Therefore, we might take that into account. And if he is sick and cannot return for that reason, the get would be valid.<br>Thus we still have no support for Rava\u2019s general principle. Stay tuned for tomorrow\u2019s exciting conclusion.", "12": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section concludes the search for a source for Rava\u2019s rule if a husband cannot return due to duress the get is considered valid, even though he wanted to return and thereby annul the get.", "13": "Having failed to find an earlier source for Rava\u2019s rule, the Talmud now resolves to saying that he stated his own reasoning. Basically he ruled that \u201cforce\u201d is not taken into account due to the problems that would occur if it were taken into account.<br>The first problem would be for overly modest women. Let\u2019s say that we were to take \u201cforce\u201d into account, meaning if the husband was delayed by circumstances out of his control, the get would be invalid. In such a case, after twelve months the husband doesn\u2019t return. For all we know he decided not to return of his own volition, as could happen. Maybe he found a different wife or a different job somewhere else. But the wife is afraid that maybe he didn\u2019t return due to duress. She would wait for him like an \u201cagunah\u201d\u2014a chained wife\u2014and not remarry. This would obviously be a terrible situation. Therefore Rava rules that we don\u2019t take into account why the husband did not return."}, "2": {"0": "The problem would also occur with what the Talmud terms \u201cloose\u201d women. Let\u2019s say the husband doesn\u2019t return and it was actually due to duress. If the halakhah was that we do take duress into account, then she is not divorced. She might disregard this possibility and go get married. When he comes back and proves that he could not return due to duress, the second marriage would be annulled and any children she had from her second husband would be mamzerim. This is obviously also a terrible result.<br>Thus, to summarize, it is best for everyone if duress is not taken into account. If the husband does not return in time, the get is valid. Why he did not return is not taken into consequence.", "1": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned that Rava does not accept claims of \u201cforce\u201d in matters of divorce because \u201cmodest women\u201d might wait too long to get remarried and \u201cloose women\u201d might not wait long enough. What this seems to mean is that if the husband does not return because of \u201cforce/duress\u201d legally she should not be divorced but the rabbis do consider her divorced in order to avoid certain problems. The issue here is that if she is not divorced how can the rabbis just consider her divorced? Isn\u2019t that in essence allowing a married woman to marry another man! This is the topic addressed here.", "2": "If according to the laws of the Torah she should be married because the divorce should not have been effective (the fact that he didn\u2019t return under duress should be taken into account), then how can the rabbis treat her as divorced?", "3": "The answer is affirmative. Basically, when people get married, they do so according to rabbinic law. They are buying into the system, if you will. Therefore, the rabbis always retain the power to annul their betrothal. This would mean that effectively, they were never married in the first place.<br>I should note that this statement appears six times in the Talmud. It almost certainly was not originally stated here, for here the topic is divorce, not betrothal. The rabbis are not annulling his betrothal, they are annulling his attempt to nullify his divorce. The statement was brought here to show the power of the rabbis to determine who and who is not married.", "4": "Ravina now asks a question of R. Ashi. It makes sense to say that the rabbis annul the betrothal if he betrothed her with money. Since they seem to have created this system of betrothal, they have the power to annul it. However, do they have such power if he betrothed her through intercourse, which is one of the three ways in which a man can betroth a woman (money, document or intercourse). It seems that this sugya considers intercourse to be a more de\u2019orayta, or perhaps more valid, form of betrothal, than money. We should note that most sugyot consider all three forms of betrothal to be equally valid.<br>The answer is that the rabbis have the power to change the nature of his intercourse with her, or at least the legal ramifications of it. While he (and she) might have thought that they were engaging in intercourse for the sake of betrothal, the rabbis have the power to say that it is in essence an act of fornication. This would mean that her betrothal would be effectively annulled.", "5": "Introduction<br>This entire section is a mirror image of the previous sections. The sugya about divorce began with Rava saying, \u201cAnd for matters of divorce, this is not so. Therefore Rava holds: There is no \u2018force\u2019 in matters of divorce.\u201d The sugya proceeded searching for sources for Rava\u2019s statement (and ultimately failed). In this section Rava says the exact opposite, and every source that was used to support him above, is here used as a difficulty on him here. But just as these sources failed to support him, they also fail to refute him. In the end both statements are left neither supported nor refuted.<br>This phenomenon of mirror-image sugyot occurs occasionally in rabbinic literature. It may be the result of the oral transmission of the literature\u2014i.e. people did not know what earlier rabbis had said. Alternatively, it may be the result of later generations intentionally emending what earlier rabbis had said.<br>Since we have already basically learned this material, my commentary is brief below.", "6": "From this Mishnah the rabbis try to deduce that if he was prevented from returning by any other cause besides death, the divorce would be valid. This would prove that force is not taken into account (it is not a valid excuse for not returning on time).", "7": "The Mishnah may use the example of death not to teach that dying is different from not returning for any other reason. It may be to teach that he can\u2019t divorce his wife once he is dead. If so, then even if he doesn\u2019t return for another reason, she is still not divorced.", "8": "The fact that an earlier Mishnah also seems to teach that there is no divorce after death may be just to reject the opinion of the other rabbis who hold that we follow the date written on the document, not the date on which he says it will take effect. Thus we have two mishnayot: One teaches that there is no divorce after death, and the other stresses that this is true even if the date on the document is earlier than the date of death.", "9": "This Mishnah seems to teach that no matter why he doesn\u2019t come back, death or illness, within twelve months, she is divorced. This would imply that there is no excuse of \u201cforce\u201d in matters of divorce. This would be a difficulty on the second version of Rava\u2019s statement.<br>But this reading is again rejected\u2014it may be that the husband wanted to stipulate that if he dies within the twelve months, the divorce is valid so that his wife could avoid being subject to levirate marriage. But if he is prevented from returning for another reason, he would not want her to be divorced.", "10": "Again, this story seems like clear evidence that we don\u2019t take \u201cforce\u201d into account. Even if we know for sure that he wants to come back, and he was prevented by the lack of a ferry from crossing the river, he is still not considered as having returned on time to annul the get. \u201cForce\u201d is not taken into account. This is a difficulty for the second version of Rava\u2019s statement.<br>The Talmud resolves the difficulty on Rava by proposing that this may be a different case, for the lack of a ferry is a foreseeable reason for not returning on time (like traffic today). In such a case, the husband should have stipulated at the outset that if the ferry prevents him from crossing the river, he will still be considered as having returned to annul the get. However, if the case was not foreseeable, then \u201cforce\u201d might still be a proper excuse.<br>The sugya thus ends without a difficulty on Rava\u2019s statement. Post-talmudic authorities were therefore left with two contradictory statements by Rava (there is/there is not \u201cforce\u201d in matters of divorce).", "11": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section returns to the Mishnah, which had stated that virgins were married on Wednesdays so that if the husband has a virginity claim, he could get to the court the next day.", "12": "Shmuel b. Yitzchak notes that the mishnah\u2019s rule\u2014that a virgin is wedded on Wednesday, depends on Ezra\u2019s enactment that the courts should sit on Mondays and Thursdays. Before Ezra, who lived when the Jews returned from Babylonia in the fifth century C.E., the courts, at least according to this source, would sit every day of the week. During those times, it would not have mattered when a virgin was married for he could always go to the court the next day.<br>I should note that this source should not be taken at historical face value. It is unclear how historical any of the attributions of these enactments to Ezra are, and even if they were accurate, it is doubtful that Ezra would have limited the days on which the court convened. Rather, what is more likely is that at some point the days in which a court convened became standardized, coordinated with the market days which took place on Monday and Thursday. However, even this is not historically certain.", "13": "The Talmud notes that the way in which R. Shmuel\u2019s statement is phrased lacks any halakhic significance. Why should we care what happened in the days before Ezra\u2019s enactment? What does this teach us about the current situation?<br>The answer is that there are ramifications for today. If there are courts that sit today on other days of the week, not just Mondays and Thursdays, then a woman could be married any day of the week.<br>This answer in my opinion cuts to the original intent of R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak. By his time the system of fixed dates for courts was probably long in disuse (this can be noted in many other places in rabbinic literature, especially Tractate Megillah). What he is saying is that now that courts do not have fixed date, the rules of the Mishnah are also outdated.", "14": "There is another problem with her being married on any day of the week. If he marries her too early in the week, how can he prepare for the wedding? Above we learned that the sages did not allow him to marry her on Sunday for this would not give him time to prepare a proper wedding feast.<br>The Talmud almost ignores this question. As long as he did prepare diligently for the wedding, he can marry her whenever he wants. Again we can see that the system of fixed days of the week for marriage seems to have fallen apart. By this period in history, people seem to have been ignoring the tannaitic sources and getting married whenever they so desired."}, "3": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section contains a baraita which goes into greater detail concerning what days of the week a virgin is married. The baraita will be explained in the coming sections as well.", "1": "This source was explained above at the beginning of the tractate. Although the court sits on Monday, theoretically allowing him to get to the court with a virginity claim should he marry her on Sunday, the rabbis did not allow this for this would not give him time to prepare a proper wedding feast. Marrying her on Wednesday allows for three days of preparation before the wedding. ", "2": "The baraita now notes that in reality people are no longer observing these customs. After the time of \u201cdanger\u201d they took on the custom to marry on Tuesday. \u201cDanger\u201d usually refers to Roman persecution of the first and second centuries C.E.. The topic will be addressed in tomorrow\u2019s passage.<br>And if there is duress, they get married on Mondays. Again, this will be explained (to a certain extent) tomorrow.", "3": "According to this source, sex with a virgin is prohibited on Shabbat for it makes a wound, and making a wound (intentionally) is considered prohibited. There will be a long passage that deals with this issue later in the Talmud. For now we should note what is odd here\u2014if he marries her on Wednesday, why are they having sex for the first time on Friday night? It is possible that this baraita already relates to the later practice of getting married on Friday. This was common in the middle ages, but it is not clear whether it is reflected here or not.", "4": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we saw a baraita which taught that in times of \u201cdanger\u201d people began to have the custom of getting married on Tuesdays. Our sugya attempts to define this danger.", "5": "If the danger is of death, meaning that the Romans persecute the Jews in order to force them to abolish their custom of marrying virgins on Wednesday, then why does it use such temperate language\u2014they had a custom to marry on Tuesday? They should abolish the custom altogether.<br>Rather, the danger is that the Romans decree that a virgin should first have relations with the governor. To avoid this, the Jews moved weddings to Tuesday.<br>We should note how historically problematic this source is. First of all, most scholars do not believe there ever was a \u201cdecree of the right of the first night.\u201d This is a folk myth/fear that appears in many cultures, including several places in rabbinic literature. But scholars do not believe that it is historically accurate.<br>Second, how would moving the wedding to Tuesday have helped? The Romans would have figured things out pretty quickly, and begun raping virgins getting married on Tuesday. This question is asked below by the Talmud itself.<br>For these and other reasons as well, it seems unlikely that this explanation is historical. Rather, in my opinion what the baraita really seems to say is that when people saw that Romans were persecuting Jews at their weddings, they abandoned their consistent wedding practices. While this might be expressed by \u201cthey had the custom to marry on Tuesday,\u201d it may mean that they just stopped marrying on Wednesday. I should note though that there is no historical evidence that Romans persecuted Jews specifically at their weddings.", "6": "Why call this danger when it is really a case of \u201cduress.\u201d Meaning that being raped is not a matter of life and death, and therefore why call it \u201cdanger\u201d which usually means death.<br>The answer is that there are some women who would rather be killed than be raped by the governor. Therefore this is indeed a matter of life and death. It truly is \u201cdanger.\u201d", "7": "A woman who is raped is not prohibited from returning to her husband, unlike an adulteress who is. Therefore, there is no reason for chaste women to prefer to die than be raped. These women should be taught that they should not choose martyrdom over rape. And then if it\u2019s not a matter of life and death, why change the custom. [I fully realize that this is a very difficult thing to read. And I stipulate that the rabbis were often not particularly sensitive to women, including in this remark. Perhaps I could suggest one positive side to this comment. What they are saying is that when a woman has been raped, as horrible as that may be, she need not allow her life to be ruined. Or better yet, society must not look at such a woman as \u201cruined,\u201d a tendency that certainly existed in the ancient world and still exists in some circles today. She can legally return to her husband and go on with her life. And her husband must take her back. I know this still makes people uncomfortable. Rape is a very difficult subject to discuss, especially for a man, which I am.]<br>The problem is that there are women who may intentionally have relations with the Roman governor. Such women are considered adulteresses and are legally not allowed to return to their husbands.<br>Furthermore, there is the issue of women married to kohanim (called here priestesses, or kohanot). A woman married to a priest who has been raped is not allowed to return to her husband, even though she clearly did nothing wrong. So simply allowing the Roman governor to rape these women before their marriage would prevent them from marrying their intended husbands.", "8": "If the Roman governor is decreeing that all virgins must first have relations with him, then the enactment to marry on Wednesday should be completely abolished. Why does the baraita just say that \u201cpeople had the custom?\u201d<br>The answer is that we don\u2019t simply uproot a rabbinic enactment due to a persecution decreed by our oppressors. This is, I believe, a deep message. The persecutions we Jews undergo are temporary. Our traditions are what more permanent and we do not easily abandon them.", "9": "This is the question I asked above\u2014if they move the custom of marrying virgins on a specific day, the governor will just come and have intercourse with the bride on that day.<br>The answer is that once the custom has been disrupted, the governor will not bother himself to seek out Jewish weddings. This might hint at what I had stated above. The baraita may testify to a general abandonment of fixed days for weddings, and not to their having been moved to another specific day. If the governor knows that virgins are married on Wednesdays, he will bring his men out to the Jewish wedding. But if he is not sure of this custom, he will not bother.", "10": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section explains the last part of the baraita we have been studying, according to which if there is \u201cduress\u201d he can marry the virgin bride even on the second day of the week. The issue our section asks is what does the baraita mean by duress?", "11": "The problem is that the previous clause in the baraita said that due to danger people began to get married on Tuesdays. We obviously cannot explain the current clause in the same way we explained the earlier clause. So what does \u201cduress\u201d mean?", "12": "Rava suggests that the \u201cduress\u201d is a general coming to town, who assumedly may kill the Jews for publicly celebrating their wedding. The assumption is that they know he is coming on Wednesday. So then, the Talmud asks, why not get married on Tuesday? The answer is that if the general comes on Wednesday, his vanguard will show up on Tuesday. Under such a circumstance it is permitted to get married on Monday.<br>We should note that what this section is really trying to state, albeit in a circuitous manner, is that if there is any danger whatsoever, the wedding may be moved.<br>I should also note that Rava said both interpretations of the baraita\u2014that the governor is coming to rape the virgin bride and that the general is coming to town. In my opinion, it is possible that originally he stated both of these statements on the same section of the baraita, but that the Talmud\u2019s editors wished to use them as interpretations for both sections. This may explain some of the difficulties over the last two days."}, "4": {"0": "Introduction<br>In last week\u2019s daf we learned that if there is some sort of duress the man can marry the virgin wife on a different day of the week (not Wednesday). Today\u2019s section opens with an alternate explanation of \u201cduress.\u201d I should note that what the following sugya really wishes to do is explore the connection between mourning and marriage. This is not so much an explanation of the earlier baraita as it is an explanation of what is done in a case where a close relative dies right before a planned wedding. The idea of discussing marriage and mourning laws in juxtaposition will be a constant theme over the next couple of pages.", "1": "The reason one may need to get married on a day that differs from the prescribed fourth day of the week is if his or her mother or father died right before the wedding. Before I explain the baraita itself, I should note that this is a difficult explanation of \u201cduress.\u201d After all, if the wedding was supposed to be on Wednesday, and \u201cduress\u201d supposedly allows them to get married on Monday, then why was the bread baked etc. already on Monday. These are preps done at the last minute to make sure the food is fresh. It seems almost impossible that such a circumstance would ever arise. This is why I said that this section is not so much of an explanation of \u201cduress\u201d as it is an explanation of what to do if someone dies right before a wedding.<br>If all of the preparations have been made and at the last minute the father of groom or mother of the bride dies, then they put the dead body into a separate room, the couple have their first sexual relations and then they separate.", "2": "This is the continuation of the baraita from above. After the first intercourse, they now celebrate the regular seven days of wedding feast. The mourning is postponed till later.<br>However, this celebration is not complete. Even though they are celebrating, they still do not have sexual relations. Not only that, they have to sleep in separate rooms, being guarded seemingly by other men and women so that they do not transgress and have sex. [Below we will see that this is not normally the halakhah during mourning].<br>Finally, the baraita adds one last piece of information. Even though they are mourning and they are not sleeping together, she still adorns herself. The rabbis were quite adamant that the two of them should not do anything so that she would not look as beautiful to her new husband during their first month of marriage.", "3": "The Talmud reads the \u201cfather of the bridegroom and mother of the bride\u201d as specific. These, according to the Talmud, are the main parties who prepare the wedding feast. If the mother of the bridegroom or father of the bride dies, they first mourn, postponing the wedding till later.<br>I should note that this is probably not the simple reading of the baraita. The simple reading is that the possessive nouns are distributive. Instead of saying, \u201cfather of the bridegroom or mother of the bridegroom or father of the bride or mother of the bride\u201d the syntax abbreviates it. This phenomenon is found elsewhere in rabbinic language.<br>In addition, I don\u2019t believe there is any reason to assume that it was specifically the father of the groom and mother of the bride who prepared the feast. It could have been any of the four parents.<br>What this does show us is why the rush to get married in the first place. The parents prepared the wedding feast. If one dies but the feast is already prepared, the only thing one can really do is just participate in the feast, despite the emotional hardship this would entail.", "4": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned that if all of the wedding preparations had been made and then suddenly one of the parents of the bride or groom died, they have the wedding and first intercourse and then they observe the seven days of the wedding feast. They do not begin mourning until later. Today\u2019s section continues to discuss that halakhah.", "5": "If water had already been put on the meat, then the meat must be eaten immediately or it will be lost. As a consequence, the wedding feast must continue despite the death of one of the parents. However, if water had not yet been put on the meat, it can still be sold. In such a case they would begin mourning and postpone the wedding. Today we might say this is like the catering already getting to the hall. If the wedding cannot carry on, there will be a substantial loss.", "6": "Both Rava and R. Papa limit R. Hisda\u2019s rule from above. According to Rava, in a city, where it would be relatively easy to sell the meat, even if water was put on it, it still must be sold. This means they would never have the wedding before the funeral.<br>Papa says that in a village it would be hard to sell the meat even if water was put on it. Therefore even if water was not put on it, it is still not sold. They would always have the wedding before the funeral.<br>But the problem is that this basically negates any validity to R. Hisda\u2019s statement. In cities they would always sell the meat no matter whether water was put on it or not. And in villages they would never sell meat. So what was R. Hisda referring to?<br>Ashi answers that R. Hisda could be referring to a small city such as Mata Mehasya. Mata Mehasya is large enough such that the meat could be sold if water had not been put on it. But it is too small to sell the meat if water had not been put on it.", "7": "This is the same baraita we saw earlier. The only difference is that a few words have been added so that it accords with R. Hisda. If he put water on the meat the meat is not sold. It is probably cited here at length so that the baraita can continue with another section.  And all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.", "8": "There are two new clauses here. The only clause that is not new is the middle clause, which we learned in yesterday\u2019s section.<br>The first clause states that if his wife becomes a menstruant during the first week of their marriage, they must sleep in separate rooms. We should note that this is different from the normal situation when a woman becomes a menstruant. In normal cases, while they cannot have relations, they do not have to sleep in separate rooms.<br>The other new clause is that he may not have first time relations with her on Friday night or Saturday night. The Talmud will clarify this below. We have already seen another baraita that stated that first time relations on Friday night were prohibited because he causes a wound. Later on the Talmud will explain why this should be prohibited on Saturday night as well.", "9": "Introduction<br>Yesterday\u2019s section included a baraita that taught that if the bride or groom are mourning right after their wedding, they must sleep in separate rooms. Today\u2019s section deals with this clause.", "10": "The baraita taught that the couple had to sleep in separate rooms during the seven days of the wedding feast (when one of the parents died right before the wedding). These seven days are like a personal festival for the couple\u2014both a festival and the wedding celebration last seven days. So they are in a sense keeping a festival and mourning at the same time. The fact that they don\u2019t sleep together is support for R. Yohanan who said that even though mourning may not be observed during any festival, one still observes private forms of mourning. For instance, if one\u2019s relative died during the festival he cannot begin mourning till after the festival. Nevertheless, he does observe some mourning practices, such as the prohibition on having sex.", "11": "Rava says that the baraita\u2019s rule that they sleep in separate rooms is only if they did not yet have intercourse. In such a case we cannot trust them not to have sex, because this will be there first time and we can assume they are excited. If they sleep in the same room, they might have sex. But if they\u2019ve already had sex at least one time, their passion should have been calmed a bit, and they can sleep in the same room. Note, the prohibition of sex remains.", "12": "The Talmud asks the obvious difficulty on Rava. How can he limit sleeping in separate rooms to a case where they have not yet had intercourse? The baraita stated that they first have intercourse and then they still have to sleep in separate rooms despite the fact that it is the first week of marriage.<br>The Talmud now adjusts what Rava was referring to. He was not referring to a case of mourning during the first week of marriage. Rather, he was referring to a case where the woman became a menstruant. If they have already had sex, then they may sleep in the same room (not the same bed). But if she became a menstruant after they were married but before they had sex for the first time, then they must sleep apart."}, "5": {"0": "The problem with the above resolution is that it sounds like the same exact rule applies to mourning as to a case where she is a menstruant\u2014if they had sex once, they may sleep in the same room. But this is not true, for in the case of mourning even though they had sex once, they must still sleep in separate rooms in the case where they are mourners during the first week of their marriage. This was stated explicitly by the baraita.<br>The Talmud resolves this by adding the words \u201cand he had not yet had intercourse with her\u201d to the baraita. When mourning during the first week of marriage, they must sleep in separate rooms, but if she is a menstruant during the first week of marriage, they sleep in separate rooms only if they have not yet had sex.", "1": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned that if he had slept with his new wife after their marriage, he could now sleep in the same room as her even if she becomes a menstruant. This means we assume they won\u2019t have sex in such a situation. However, if he is a mourner during the first week of marriage, even if they have already had sex, they still have to sleep in separate rooms. This implies that it is easier for him (and her) to transgress the laws of mourning than it would be to transgress the laws of prohibited sex during menstruation. Today the Talmud questions that assumption.", "2": "These two sources both deal with the relations between a husband and wife when they are not allowed to have sex: mourning and menstruation. When she is a \u201cniddah\u201d (a menstruant) she can continue to perform the normal household work, but she cannot perform any forms of work that are considered to be acts of affection: mixing for him a cup of water and wine, making his bed or washing his face, hands and feet. This means that we are concerned lest by performing these acts, they will be led to have sex.<br>On the other hand, when mourning she may perform these actions. This implies that we are less concerned that they have sex when mourning.<br>Taken together, this contradicts the relationship between the two times in which sex is prohibited that we saw in the earlier sugya about the first week of marriage.", "3": "The Talmud resolves the difficult by positing that there is a difference between a case where he is in mourning and a case where she is in mourning. The earlier sources about sleeping in separate rooms were a case where he was mourning. When he is in mourning, they must sleep in separate rooms. Evidently he will still desire sex (perhaps as a comfort) and since she is not herself mourning, she will not stop him. But when she is mourning, she may perform actions of affection for him. Even if this causes him to desire her, she will rebuff him because she is in mourning.<br>The problem with this resolution is that the earlier baraita had referred to either of them being in mourning. So how could we limit that to a case where only he is in mourning?<br>The resolution is that the line \u201cthe father of the bridegroom or mother of the bride\u201d refers to the other rules in the baraita concerning having the wedding before the funeral. These rules are true no matter who is in mourning. But as far as sleeping in separate rooms, this is true only if his family member died.<br>If some of this seems counterintuitive (for instance that he would be tempted to have sex while a mourner) we will continue the discussion tomorrow. Also there are other versions of this text that reverse the version found in the printed edition (the words for his/her are only a \u201cyod\u201d apart in Aramaic.) There are major problems with these other versions as well, so I have stuck with explaining the version preserved here.", "4": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned that if the husband is in mourning during the first week of his marriage he and his wife must sleep in separate rooms. His mourning is not so serious in his own eyes, therefore we fear that he will transgress and sleep with his wife. But if she is mourning, she may perform work that shows her affections for him and we are not afraid they will have sex. This difference between her mourning and his mourning is questioned by today\u2019s section.", "5": "The first baraita states that there are no differences between her mourning and his mourning. In both cases they basically observe mourning together. She does not put on makeup, and they both overturn the beds, a prominent sign of mourning in the Talmudic period. So how can we say above that there is a difference between the two?", "6": "To resolve the problem the Talmud basically adds in a line. When he is mourning, they sleep in separate rooms. But when she is in mourning they need not do so.", "7": "The problem with distinguishing between his mourning and hers is that the baraita explicitly stated \u201cand so too,\u201d implying that both situations are treated the same.<br>The resolution is that they are both the same vis a vis putting on paint and rouge. No matter who is mourning, she does not put on makeup. But if he is mourning, they must sleep in separate rooms, whereas if she is in mourning, they may sleep in the same room.", "8": "The second problem is that the baraita explicitly stated that she is with him, seeming to imply that although he is mourning, they may sleep in the same bed.<br>This too is resolved. \u201cWith him\u201d means only that they sleep in the same house. This is confirmed by a halakhah stated by Rav to his son Hiyya upon the death of Hiyya\u2019s wife\u2019s parent. Rav told Hiyya that he must observe customs of mourning with her when in the same house. But when in a separate house, he need not mourn, for it was not his relative that died. What the word \u201che/she observes mourning with him\u201d means is that they must keep mourning when in front of each other, but not when apart. It does not mean that they can necessarily sleep in the same bed.<br>I should note that this last halakhah is no longer really observed. We only mourn for our close relatives, and when a relative of our relative dies (in-laws) we may act out of great sympathy, but people no longer observe laws of mourning, even when in the presence of their partner. This is part of a long process of reducing the circle of people over whom we mourn.", "9": "Ashi says that the mourning practices during the first week of marriage are different from normal cases of mourning. Since the rabbis were more lenient in that case, the husband might come to sleep with his wife. But in other cases, since the laws are stricter, we have no such concern and they may sleep in the same room. ", "10": "Introduction<br>At the beginning of this amud (half-page) of Talmud there was a complex difficulty comparing the laws of the first week of marriage (if mourning, they sleep apart, if menstruating they may sleep in same room) with other times of one\u2019s life (if mourning she may perform acts of affection, if menstruating she may not). These seem to be opposite, for in the first case we fear that he will sleep with her despite the fact that he is mourning, whereas in the second case we have no such fear. In today\u2019s section, R. Ashi says that this comparison is not justified.", "11": "What is the leniency to which R. Ashi refers? It cannot be that he is allowed to have relations with her before the burial. That is not a leniency since he is not yet considered by law to be a mourner. The tannaim dispute when mourning begins. R. Eliezer holds that it is when the body has been taken out of the house to be brought to the cemetery. R. Joshua holds that it is when the tomb has been sealed with the stone rolled in front of the grave. But as long as the body is still in the house, all agree that mourning has not yet begun.<br>The leniency is therefore that they can celebrate the seven days of the wedding feast before they begin sitting \u201cshiva,\u201d the seven days of mourning. This really is a leniency that might lead to them having sex. They are partying and celebrating all day long, and at night we can imagine that despite the fact that they are also in mourning, they might come to have sex. But under more normal circumstances, the fact that a person is in mourning will deter them from having sex. They can therefore sleep in the same room.", "12": "We already learned earlier why the husband is not allowed to have sex with his virginal wife on Shabbat. The wound that first time sex on Shabbat is considered (by some) to be prohibited. But why should they not have sex for the first time after Shabbat."}, "6": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section deals with the part of the baraita from above according to which a couple should not have first time sex on the evening before or after Shabbat. As I stated above, I think that what the baraita really means is that one should not get married on erev Shabbat (Friday) or motzei Shabbat (Sunday). Indeed, the version of this baraita in the Talmud Yerushalmi says exactly that.", "1": "Zera says that the reason that first time sex is prohibited on Saturday night is \u201creckoning accounts.\u201d Rashi explains that if they get married on Saturday night the husband will have to make a big feast that night and on Shabbat he will calculate in his head how much the meal will cost. This is why getting married/first time sex is prohibited on Saturday night.<br>The problem with this explanation is that there are a series of sources cited by Abaye that say that one may reckon accounts on Shabbat as long as they are for the sake of a mitzvah. These sources are a general collection of what is permitted on Shabbat as long as they are done for the public good or for a mitzvah. One should not calculate on Shabbat calculations that are not for a mitzvah. I shouldn\u2019t be talking with people about how much the house costs or car costs or things like that. But if we need to make some calculations in discussing a public good or mitzvah, it is permitted. So this cannot be the reason that it is prohibited to have sex with a virgin on Saturday night.<br>Stay tuned for tomorrow\u2019s section for the exciting conclusion of this sugya!", "2": "Introduction<br>Yesterday\u2019s section dealt with a baraita according to which sexual relations with a virgin is prohibited on Saturday night. But the amoraim failed to explain why this is so. Today\u2019s section is a new interpretation of this prohibition.", "3": "Zera said that if they do the wedding on Saturday night, they might come to slaughter a bird on Shabbat for the wedding feast. I should note that this is in line with the reason it is very rare to have a Jewish wedding today on Saturday night. It is simply too likely that there will be some desecration of Shabbat involved in preparing for the meal.<br>Abaye notes that if we were concerned with slaughtering an animal for food on Shabbat, we should not allow Yom Kippur to fall on Monday (Sunday night), lest he slaughter a bird on Shabbat.<br>Rashi says that if Yom Kippur starts on Sunday night, he will need to eat a big meal during the day on Sunday and he might start preparing on Shabbat itself. ", "4": "There are two main differences between preparing for the wedding feast on Saturday night and preparing for Yom Kippur on Sunday night. First of all, for Yom Kippur one needs to prepare only for one\u2019s family/oneself. It is not such a big meal that one would need to start preparing on Shabbat. Therefore it is not a problem.<br>Second, and I think this is really the key difference, there is a lot more time to prepare for Yom Kippur on Sunday night than there is for a Saturday night wedding. This seems to me to be such an obvious difference that Abaye\u2019s difficulty makes little sense. In my opinion Abaye understood the prohibition as getting married on Sunday, such that the feast would fall Sunday night, the same time that the meal before Yom Kippur would fall if Yom Kippur was on Sunday night. So if one can have Yom Kippur on Sunday night, Abaye notes, why can\u2019t one have the wedding feast. In contrast, the Talmud understood the prohibition as first time sex on Saturday night, which made the difficulty more difficult to understand. ", "5": "The Talmud concludes this section by noting that the same problem of preparing a meal on Shabbat could occur if they have first time sex on Friday night. They will need to prepare a big feast for that night, and they might come to slaughter the fowl right before it is cooked, after Shabbat has already begun.<br>I should note that by the medieval period, it had become the norm to get married on Fridays. People were simply poor and could not take off of work during the week. So they got married on Friday, and combined the wedding feast with the one big meal of the week, Friday night. As tends to happen in these situations, they found various ways to get around the Talmud\u2019s prohibition.", "6": "Introduction<br>The Mishnah stated that a virgin is married on Wednesday so that if her husband has a virginity claim, he can get to the court on Thursday. However, as I noted in my explanation to the Mishnah, the rabbis provide other reasons why she is married on Wednesday (and a non-virgin on Thursday). One of those reasons is found in today\u2019s section, but here it is woven into a sub-question concerning the Mishnah\u2014while we already know she is married on Wednesday so that her husband can get to the court on Thursday, is the sex to occur on Wednesday night or can it occur during the day on Wednesday.", "7": "The issue the Talmud addresses is whether we are worried that he will \u201ccool down.\u201d What this means is that he will find his wife not to be a virgin and get upset immediately. But by the time the court sits the next day he will have already forgiven her, not make his virginity claim and stay married to her. We might very well ask why this would be so problematic? After all, wouldn\u2019t we want him to stay with her anyways, especially if he wants to? The answer is found in the Yerushami which notes that if he finds her not to be a virgin, she might even be an adulteress. If she had sex with another man after betrothal, then she is an adulteress and according to halakhah she may not stay married her to her husband. Therefore, what we are afraid of is that he will forgive his wife for potentially having cheated on him.<br>If we are afraid that he will forgive her, then they should have sex only on Wednesday night, as close as possible to when the court convenes on Thursday morning. But if we are not concerned with him cooling down, then they can have sex Wednesday during the day.", "8": "As an answer to the question, the Talmud cites a baraita attributed to Bar Kapara. According to Bar Kapara, the reason for these specific days is that the \u201cblessing\u201d in the Torah was written on those days, on Thursday and Friday. The \u201cblessing\u201d is \u201cbe fruitful and multiply\u201d which was said to the fishes on Thursday and to humans and other mammals on Friday.<br>From here the Talmud concludes that we are not concerned that he should \u201ccool down.\u201d The sex is to occur at night between Wednesday and Thursday, but not for that reason. Rather, the sex occurs at night because of \u201cblessing.\u201d", "9": "If a virgin has first sex on Wednesday night (beginning of Thursday) because of blessing, then the widow should also have sex on that day. So why is her day Thursday night/Friday? The answer seems obvious\u2014the day on which people were blessed is preferable to the day when fish were blessed.<br>We should note that the reason of \u201cblessing\u201d is considered only partial\u2014it doesn\u2019t explain why a virgin is married on Wednesday. After all, if the reason was \u201cblessing\u201d then she should have been married on Thursday, because the blessing for people was said on Friday. \u201cBlessing\u201d only explains why the sex is on Wednesday night.", "10": "The Talmud now brings in another baraita that explains why a widow has first sex on Thursday night, not Thursday during the day. Again, I should note that originally this baraita explained why she is married on Thursday in the first place, not why the sex occurs on Thursday night. She is married on Thursday so that her husband will celebrate with her three days, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Since second marriages are less celebratory, if he married her a different day of the week, he would go right back to work.<br>But the Talmud again takes the baraita and uses it to explain a side question\u2014when do they have first sex: Thursday during the day or Thursday night. We should note that it is somewhat unlikely that his going to work on Friday will be determined by whether they had sex during the day on Thursday or at night.", "11": " Both reasons \u201cthey watched over\u201d and \u201cblessing\u201d lead to the conclusion that a widow is wed on Thursday and the first intercourse takes place on Thursday night. So, the Talmud asks, as it often does, is there any practical ramification between the two? There are indeed two cases where there is a practical ramification. First of all, if the man does not work. In such a case, the reason of \u201cblessing\u201d dictates that he still have first intercourse with his wife on Thursday night, because the blessing to people was said on Friday. But if we use the reason of \u201cthey watched over\u201d then we don\u2019t have to worry about him going to work on Friday, because he never goes to work.<br>The second difference is if there is a festival on Friday. In such a case we need not worry about him going to work. But the reason of \u201cblessing\u201d would still hold true.<br>In short, the reason of \u201cthey watched over\u201d is not absolute. It changes based on circumstance. But the reason of \u201cblessing\u201d is always present."}, "7": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section is here because it begins with another derashah (loosely translated as sermonic comment) attributed to Bar Kappara, the same sage whose derashah was found in yesterday\u2019s section. The topic has nothing to do with the issue being discussed in Ketubot.", "1": "Bar Kappara rhetorically wishes to prove that the works of the righteous are greater, i.e. harder to create, than the creation of heaven and earth. In creating the heavens and earth, God is described as using only one hand. In contrast, in creating the Temple, God is described as using two hands (the Hebrew is in the plural). Rashi explains that the Temple is the \u201cwork of the righteous\u201d for in reality it is people that actually build the Temple.", "2": "Hiyya, a sage of Babylonian origin who moved to Israel, raises some difficulties on the notion that God used only one hand in creating the world. Psalms 95 says that God used His \u201chands\u201d in forming the dry land\u2014two hands. This difficulty is answered by taking note of the defective spelling of the word, \u201c\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u201d and not \u201c\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5.\u201d [Note that the Masoretic text does not use the defective spelling. It is not all that uncommon for the Talmud to refer to a biblical text slightly different from the text in use today.] The defective spelling means that the verse really says only one hand.<br>The second difficulty is from the verb form\u2014the plural of \u201cformed.\u201d This again implies that God used two hands in forming the dry land.<br>Nahman b. Yitzchak solves the plural form by stating that it refers to fingers, not hands. God created the world using one hand, but at least he used more than just one finger.", "3": "Again, a verse is cited to show that God used two hands to create the world.<br>As a resolution, the Talmud reinterprets the verse. \u201cThe work of his hands\u201d does not refer to God\u2019s creation of the world\u2014it refers to the acts of the righteous, the righteous deeds that they perform. And who testifies as to the deeds of the righteous? The \u201cfirmament\u201d (Rakia in Hebrew, the name of my youngest daughter!) responds to the righteous deeds of human beings by bringing rain. This reflects the Jewish notion that God blesses the world with rain in response to the good deeds done by the righteous. ", "4": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section contains another derashah by Bar Kappara, the same sage whose words were the focus of the previous two sections.", "5": "The Torah mandates that people own a peg to bury their waste when they go to the bathroom in the fields. The word for \u201camong your gear\u201d is \u201cazen\u201d which sounds like \u201cozen\u201d the Hebrew word for ear. Bar Kapara therefore understands this to mean that you should have a \u201cpeg\u201d for your ear. If you are about to hear something unworthy, you should put your finger in your ear so that you do not hear it. There may also be something close to the simple meaning of the verse in this derashah. The Torah mandates that we keep our living quarters clean, free from human waste. Bar Kapara adds that if this is true with physical waste, how much more is it true with unworthy words, mental/social waste products.", "6": "This same message is derived from R. Elazar\u2019s question concerning why people\u2019s fingers are shaped like pegs. First the Talmud notes that each finger has a certain halakhic purpose. The little finger is called the \u201czeret\u201d and it is used to measure a part of the high priest\u2019s breast plate. The ring finger is called \u201ckemitzah\u201d for the priest uses it when taking a fist of the meal (minhah) offering. The middle finger is called \u201camah\u201d which means cubit, and this finger is used in constituting a cubit. The pointer is called \u201cetzba\u201d and it is used to apply blood to the altar. The thumb is called \u201cgudal\u201d (agudal in modern Hebrew) and it is the finger on which the Torah commands blood to be put for certain sacrifices.<br>Rather, the question is\u2014why are fingers shaped in such a way? The answer is the same as above\u2014so that we can put them in our ears to prevent ourselves from hearing bad things.<br>It is interesting to note that the ear is a sensory organ that is very hard to close. We can close our eyes and we can even pinch our noses shut. But even when we close our ears with our hands, sounds can make it through. This means that we must be especially cautious not to be near unworthy things when they are stated.", "7": "The sugya concludes with two additional exhortations not to listen to unworthy things.<br>I must share a story with you. My grandmother, of blessed memory, was in an accident when she was young, and lost hearing in one of her ears. In my house we did a short, abbreviated birkat hamazon on Shabbat. She was more Orthodox and wished to do the full birkat hamazon. So to prevent getting confused, she would fold up the bottom of her one hearing ear, and insert it in her ear, exactly like it says here.<br>The ear is the softest of the external organs. It is \u201cburned first\u201d which can be taken literally, in that if a person is burned, the ears are most easily destroyed. It also can be taken figuratively. Our ears are always open, making them particularly vulnerable to the harm done by \u201cidle things.\u201d.", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins a long passage concerning whether it is permissible to have first time sex with a virgin on Shabbat. There were several baraitot (tannaitic sources) cited earlier that prohibited this. Nevertheless, the Talmud, for whatever reason, ignores those sources.<br>The proper place for this sugya is really Tractate Shabbat for it mostly deals with issues of what constitutes forbidden labor on Shabbat. In the Yerushalmi it is found in Tractate Berakhot, for the passage cites a Mishnah from Berakhot concerning reciting the Shema during the first week of marriage. The Bavli brings the entire passage here to Ketubot for it is related to the first week of marriage, a topic discussed in this chapter.<br>Today\u2019s section is an elaborate question, typical of the Bavli, where every possible reason to permit and prohibit are examined. The point of this question seems to be to examine every theoretical possibility in understanding the nature and purpose of first-time sex on Shabbat and whether it should be prohibited. It is an elaborate question, and since it is so highly theoretical, some of the possibilities mentioned might seem strange.<br>As usual, I adopt a neutral, clinical tone in discussing these matters. I realize and understand that some people are troubled by men discussing women\u2019s bodies.", "9": "This is in essence an anatomical question. If the blood is simply stored up in the woman\u2019s womb and waiting to come out, then the husband is not wounding her by having sex for the first time. He is just letting out already-gathered blood, which is not a Sabbath transgression. But if he is opening a fresh wound, then it is prohibited.", "10": "If the blood is stored up in the womb, it is allowed, but only if he just needs to let out the blood (perhaps as a sign that she was a virgin). But if he needs to create an opening to allow future intercourse, then it is forbidden, since it is forbidden to make a new opening on Shabbat.", "11": "We had said above that if he didn\u2019t need the opening, then it is permitted. This implies that if one performs a forbidden act on Shabbat, but did not intend to do that act, the act is permitted. In other words, he intended to let out the blood. It was not his intention to create an opening, but an opening was created. Is this permitted? There is a dispute about this issue among tannaim. R. Shimon holds that in cases such as these, the act is permitted. But R. Judah holds that it is prohibited.", "12": "There is yet another aspect to this question: Is he considered as having damaged or improved? R. Judah holds that if one performs a forbidden labor on Shabbat, but that act was destructive, he is not liable. So if the halakhah follows R. Judah in that unintentional acts are prohibited, do we also follow R. Judah in that destructive acts are not prohibited?", "13": "The Talmud now elaborates on the second possibility from above\u2014first-time sex creates a wound and therefore should be prohibited. However, this is only true if his intent is actually to create a wound. But if his intent is simply to have pleasure, then the wound is a by-product. It is not his intent and therefore the act is permitted.", "14": "If he intends just to have pleasure, then the act is permitted, but only if the halakhah follows R. Shimon. R. Shimon says that if one did not intend to perform the forbidden act, it is permitted. But if the halakhah follows R. Judah, it is prohibited.", "15": "If the halakhah follows R. Judah and therefore it should be prohibited, we still have to ask whether it is a destructive act or constructive one. If it is considered destructive it is permitted.", "16": "Even if we determine that first-time sex is destructive, it is only R. Judah who would permit it. R. Shimon forbids destructive acts.<br>This concludes the complex question that opens the sugya. As we shall see, the amoraim barely relate to this question. It seems to have been a late addition to the passage, inserted by the editors of the Talmud, as a sort of introduction to all of the legal ramifications and principles related to the particular topic of first-time sex on Shabbat."}, "8": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins to cite traditions that will answer the question asked at the end of last week\u2019s daf\u2014is it permitted to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat?", "1": "The amoraim Rav and Shmuel debate whether it is permitted. Curiously (or perhaps not so curiously) every school wants to say that their rabbi, be it Rav or Shmuel, is the lenient one. This is noted explicitly by R. Nahman b. Yitzchak, who says that if you can\u2019t remember which bet midrash teaches the debate which way, you can remember that everyone is lenient on themselves. Seems that no one really wanted to deny sex with a virgin on Shabbat.", "2": "The Talmud initially raises a difficulty on the version of the dispute which reads that Rav is the stringent amora, forbidding sex with a virgin on Shabbat. There is another tradition where Rav states that it is forbidden to squeeze back in a stopper into a brewing vat on Yom Tov, the festival. This is because by doing so he will inevitably squeeze some beer out of the cloth stopper, and squeezing liquids out of something is prohibited on Shabbat/Yom Tov. Now this is true even though his intention was not to squeeze out the liquid. His intention was to put the stopper back into the brewing vat. This implies that Rav rules like R. Judah\u2014even though someone\u2019s intention was to perform a permitted act, if in doing so he performs a forbidden act, it is prohibited. So if Rav rules like R. Judah how can he allow sex with a virgin on Shabbat, since this will cause a wound?<br>The resolution is that in the case of putting the stopper into the brewing vat, even R. Shimon, the lenient sage, would prohibit because it is a case where the prohibited work, squeezing, will certainly be performed. This is called by the Talmud a case of \u201cif he cuts off its head, will it not die.\u201d According to Rashi this refers to a case where someone wants to give his son the head of a bird to play with as a toy (they did not have ipads back then). He does not want to kill the bird, just give its head to his son to play with as a toy. But obviously, he cannot give the head to the child without killing the bird, which is prohibited on Shabbat. So he cannot claim that cutting the head off is permitted because it was not his intention that the bird die. This rule teaches that while R. Shimon generally permits someone to perform an action if his intent was not to perform the prohibited labor, if the prohibited labor is certain to occur, even R. Shimon prohibits.<br>In sum, Rav can logically prohibit putting back the beer vat plug on Shabbat, but still allow one to have first time sex on Shabbat. Evidently, the wound is not certain.", "3": "In these traditions a few amoraim relate that in general Rav holds like R. Judah\u2014even when it is not one\u2019s intention to perform the forbidden labor, the act is still prohibited. So how can the earlier amoraim hold that Rav was lenient in the case of sex on Shabbat with a virgin? The same is true with Shmuel\u2014he usually rules like R. Shimon, that if one\u2019s intent is not to perform the forbidden labor, the act is permitted. So how can he rule that sex on Shabbat with a virgin is prohibited?", "4": "Even if Rav holds like R. Judah, he still can allow sex with a virgin on Shabbat because no matter how we explain, the labor is one of damaging. It is not a constructive act, and therefore R. Judah permits it. The explanation refers to the question found in yesterday\u2019s section. If we say that the blood is stored in the womb and he is making an opening, then this opening may still be considered damaging and not constructive. And if he holds that the blood is the result of a wound, the act can still be deemed destructive. In either case it is a wound.", "5": "Introduction<br>We continue to discuss sex with a virgin on Shabbat. I want to reiterate that I realize that these discussions are uncomfortable for some people, but that I adopt a clinical approach to their analysis. I neither condemn practices mentioned in them (I think they were often the norms of the time) nor do I suggest that they should be norms for our times.", "6": "This source is Mishnah Niddah 10:1. The Mishnah is concerned with differentiating between menstrual blood and virginal blood. If the wife menstruates, she and her husband may no longer have sex. But virginal blood does not cause sex to be prohibited. The determination hinges on whether she is old enough to menstruate. If she is, then a longer period is given during which we assume the blood is virginal. For instance, if she is too young to menstruate, Bet Hillel says that we assume that any blood is virginal until she heals from the original would caused during sex. But Bet Shammai says we can assume that the blood is virginal for only four nights.<br>The key to the difficulty raised by R. Hisda is the second clause. If she has reached the age of menstruation he is allowed to assume the blood is virginal for the first four nights. To R. Hisda this means that even if he had not yet had sex with her, he still may do so for all of the first four nights after they were wed on Wednesday, including Shabbat. This is proof that sex with a virgin is permitted on Shabbat."}, "9": {"0": "Rava tries to resolve the prohibition of having sex with a virgin on Shabbat by claiming that the Mishnah permits every night except for Shabbat.<br>Against this Abaye argues that the Mishnah explicitly says \u201cfour nights.\u201d This must include Shabbat.", "1": "Rava now resolves the difficulty in an entirely different manner. The Mishnah rules that it is permitted to have sex on Friday night with his new wife, but only if they already had intercourse on Wednesday or Thursday night. This accords better with the Mishnah, which assumes they are married on Wednesday and therefore the sex that occurs on Friday night would not be when she is a virgin.<br>If we were to ask why the Mishnah bothers teaching that he can have sex with her on Friday night after they have already had sex on the previous nights, the Talmud notes that we might have thought that sex (or sex with a woman who had only begun to have sex very recently) was prohibited on Shabbat, even though it is not first time sex. This is similar to a different case taught by Shmuel. Shmuel allows one to enter a narrow opening (probably some hole in a wall) even though he will cause pebbles to break loose. This is permitted because the opening already exists and it is certainly not his intention to cause the pebbles to fall. So too, we might have thought it would be prohibited to have second or third time sex on Shabbat, just as it is prohibited to have first time sex. It is not. ", "2": "Introduction<br>The discussion of sex on Shabbat with a virgin continues. Again, an amora raises a difficulty on the position that it is prohibited.", "3": "According to the Mishnah in Berakhot, a bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema because he is too concerned with the task at hand (first time sex) and will not be able to focus on the Shema. The Mishnah states without any ambiguity that if he has not yet had sex with his new wife, he is exempt till Saturday night. This seems to imply that he could be having sex for the first time with his virgin wife on Friday night.", "4": "Abaye denies that the Mishnah allows a husband to have sex for the first time on Friday night. He is exempt on Friday night from the Shema not because he could possibly have sex with his virgin wife that night. He is exempt because he is anxious that he did not have sex the first two nights of marriage. We should note that this is an entirely different type of anxiety. In the case where he was going to have sex that night, he is anxious about the act itself. He won\u2019t be able to focus on the Shema because he has something to do (and he\u2019s understandably nervous about it). According to Abaye, he\u2019s just distressed and nevertheless, he is still exempt from Shema. Rava is about to pounce on this notion.", "5": "Rava responds to Abaye that simple \u201canxiety\u201d over something that already happened is not sufficient to exempt one from reciting the Shema (or observing other commandments). If this were so, then even one who was upset that his ship had already sunk would be exempt. As proof Rava cites Rav\u2019s statement that a mourner is obligated in all commandments except tefillin. He is exempt from tefillin because they are considered an \u201cornament.\u201d This is based on a midrashic reading of Ezekiel 24:17. Ezekiel is mourning the loss of his wife, but God tells him that he is not allowed to mourn. He is instructed to wear his \u201cornament\u201d which the rabbis interpret as tefillin. Since Ezekiel the mourner is told to wear tefillin, it seems that other, regular mourners, may not.", "6": "Introduction<br>Rava now says that there is a tannaitic dispute as to whether one can have sex with a virgin on Shabbat.", "7": "According to the first baraita, he is exempt from Shema on the third night if he has not yet had sex. If the wedding took place on Wednesday, then the third night is Friday night. This means that sex with a virgin is permitted on Friday night, and therefore he is exempt from the Shema.<br>The second baraita says that in all cases the groom must recite the Shema on Friday night. This baraita would hold that sex with a virgin is prohibited, and hence there is no reason for him to be exempt.", "8": "Abaye holds that all tannaim rule that sex with a virgin on Shabbat is prohibited. It is not a tannaitic dispute as Rava claimed. So how come one tanna holds that a groom is obligated to recite the Shema on Friday night? That tanna holds that his anxiety over not yet having had sex is what exempts him from the Shema and not the fact that he is going to have (or at least attempt) sex that night.", "9": "The Talmud now brings another baraita which shows a tannaitic dispute about sex with a virgin on Shabbat. Rabbah says that the \u201csages\u201d who allow this are R. Shimon, for R.Shimon holds in general that if one does not intend to perform the forbidden labor, the act is permitted. Here his intention is to have sex, and not to cause a wound. Therefore, the sex is permitted even if he does end up causing a wound.", "10": "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday\u2019s section, Rava said that R. Shimon, who in general allows one to perform an act on Shabbat as long as his intention was not to perform a forbidden labor, would allow a man to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat. Since his intention is not to make a wound, the act is permitted.<br>In today\u2019s section Abaye calls this into question because while making a wound was not the husband\u2019s intention, it seems to be a certainty that it will occur.", "11": "Abaye argues that sex with a virgin is like the case of the bird having its head cut off so the kid could use it as a toy (I explained this in 6-1). Since the forbidden labor will certainly occur, R. Shimon agrees that the act is prohibited.<br>Rava responds that there are those who can have sex with a virgin without causing a wound. They somehow \u201cmove to the side.\u201d This is a skill referred to here and in several other places in the Talmud. It is unclear what exactly it is, but it sounds like some kind of gentle way of having intercourse such that the woman\u2019s hymen would not be broken. Since the forbidden labor will not certainly occur, R. Shimon would permit.", "12": "If the person is skilled enough to know how to have intercourse by moving aside, why should he be so anxious such that he need not read the Shema that night? In other words Abaye is saying that if you claim that the person has skill, then the entire baraita about Shema makes no sense.<br>Rava responds that the baraita refers to one who is not skilled. He is anxious so he is exempt from Shema.<br>But, Abaye responds yet again, if this is true, then we should have said that one who is skilled is allowed to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat, but one who is not skilled may not do so.<br>Rava responds that since most people have such skill, it is permitted for all men to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat", "13": "Rava (a different amora with this name) raises a different difficulty. Elsewhere in the tractate we shall see that people were concerned about the evidence that she was a virgin. To ascertain this evidence a sheet was used (this is mentioned in the Torah as well). Furthermore, groomsmen were placed in or at least near the room to make sure that he or she did not fake or lose the evidence. The sheet and the system of groomsmen make sense only if it is expected that she will bleed from the wound that he creates. If most men know how to have sex without rupturing the hymen, then why bother with the sheet or groomsmen?<br>Abaye answers that the groomsmen are there lest the husband tamper with the evidence. They would make sure that the husband does not hide the evidence of her virginity and then claim that she was not a virgin. We should note that this type of scheming husband is already described in Deuteronomy.", "14": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s short section cites another difficulty on the halakhah that it is forbidden to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat.", "15": "A Mishnah from Tractate Shabbat rules that lancing an abscess is permitted on Shabbat, as long as his intention is not to make an opening, just to release the pus. With regard to sex with a virgin, R. Ammi assumes that his intention is to release the blood. Perhaps this assumption is based on the fact that the husband wishes to see the blood as a sign of her virginity. In any case, this Mishnah is used by R. Ammi to prove that sex with a virgin should be permitted on Shabbat.<br>The Talmud responds that anatomically these are different cases. In the case of the abscess, the pus is stored up and is ready to be released. It is not in the walls of the organs. Thus this is permitted because he is not making a wound. But in the case of virginity blood, while the blood is stored up, it is not ready to be released, and therefore this could be considered a wound. Therefore, it may be forbidden, for by releasing the blood through a wound he is performing the forbidden labor he intended to perform."}, "10": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section concludes the discussion of sex with a virgin on Shabbat. I know it\u2019s been a long discussion. It does seem that this was a hot topic in rabbinic circles, perhaps for two reasons. First of all, it refers to sex, a topic that the rabbis do seem to spend a considerable amount of energy discussing. Second, it has significant relevance to some general principles concerning Shabbat, another topic that rabbis spend considerable time discussing.", "1": "The Talmud now begins to relate some actual rulings that seem to have been issued by rabbis. In other words, these are not theoretical halakhot or discussions, such as those that appeared above. They are concrete rulings. R. Ammi allows sex with a virgin on Shabbat.<br>The other rabbis raise a difficulty we have not yet seen elsewhere\u2014what about the ketubah? Generally, it is prohibited for a man to have a wife without having given her first her ketubah. The rabbis\u2019 difficulty on R. Ammi reflects the idea that they would wait to give the ketubah until after the marriage had been consummated. Perhaps this was done so that he could ensure that she was actually a virgin. We should note that this is not normative practice. In any case, if he has first sex on Shabbat, how could he write for her a ketubah that night, when writing is forbidden on Shabbat?<br>The answer is that he could just give her some movable goods, at least as temporary substitute for her ketubah.", "2": "This time we have two versions\u2014either R. Zevid permitted others to have first intercourse on Shabbat, or he himself had first intercourse. In either case it is permitted.", "3": "Rav Judah allowed one to have sex with a virgin on a festival. But what we do not know is if he would have extended the same permission to Shabbat. As we shall see, the laws of the festival and the laws of Shabbat are not always the same.<br>Papi argues that Rav Judah would have permitted also on Shabbat. The only reason he permitted specifically on the festival is that he was asked about such a case.", "4": "Papa disagrees with R. Papi, and holds that while it permitted to have sex with a virgin on the festival, it is not permitted on Shabbat.<br>Papi then asks what grounds there might be for such a difference. The main difference between Shabbat and the festival is that one is allowed to prepare food on the festival. This includes slaughtering an animal, lighting a fire and cooking. R. Papi assumes that R. Papa makes the following argument. The reason to prohibit sex with a virgin on Shabbat is that it makes a wound. Making a wound on the festival (slaughtering an animal) in order to eat (for a necessity) is permitted. Therefore, making a wound on the festival when it is not for the sake of eating (first time sex) should also be permitted.<br>The problem, R. Papi says, is that we don\u2019t consistently apply such thinking. Lighting a fire on the festival is permitted for the sake of cooking. But it is not permitted for the sake of burning incense. From here we can see that just because something is permitted when done for a necessity is it permitted when performed not for a necessity.<br>Papa responds based on a midrash on the last two words of the verse, \u201cby every person.\u201d The act is permitted only if all people benefit from it, meaning all classes of society engage in it. Incense was something used by the rich, and therefore it cannot be burned on the festival. But sex is something everyone does, and therefore it is permitted on the festival, even if it causes a wound.", "5": "Aha raises a difficulty on the above conclusion that only if everyone is customary to use a certain item can the work involved be performed on the festival (if the same work is permitted when done to prepare food). Deer meat was evidently not eaten by everyone, only by the rich. So using this logic if one came across a deer (not by hunting), he could not kill it to eat it on the festival! This is obviously not true. So, the question is: how come it is permitted to slaughter a deer on the festival?<br>To answer, R. Ashi revises the midrash\u2014if it is something \u201cneeded\u201d by every person, it is permitted. Deer meat might be eaten only by the rich, but it is still food, and everybody needs food. Therefore, even though it is rich person\u2019s food, one can slaughter it on the festival. In contrast, incense is not something everybody needs. Therefore, it cannot be burned on the festival.", "6": "This section begins with another halakhic ruling\u2014this time prohibiting sex with a virgin on Shabbat.<br>The Talmud seems to think that the word \u201cinstruction\u201d implies that something should be permitted\u2014so how is it that R. Yohanan \u201cinstructed\u201d something that it is forbidden.<br>In the end they find two cases where the word \u201cinstruction\u201d is used and it does create a prohibition. The first is a Mishnah from Nazir 3:6 where Bet Hillel instructions Helena the Queen that she should be a Nazirite for another seven years after moving to Israel. See there in my comments in Mishnah Yomit for my information.<br>The second has to do with what makes an animal a \u201ctrefa\u201d\u2014unfit to be eaten. If its spinal cord was severed it is a trefa.

Boaz and Ruth indeed had the blessing recited, but only for one day.", "12": "The Talmud now cites a baraita that appeared earlier in this chapter. The baraita asked why a widow is married on Thursday. The answer was that this gives the husband three days to celebrate with her until he goes back to work on Sunday. The problem is that this doesn\u2019t match either of the situations mentioned above. If he is a widower marrying a widow, then the blessing is only one day. And if he is a young man, getting married for the first time, then the blessing should be seven days, even if he is marrying a widow.<br>The Talmud resolves this by separating the requirement for reciting a blessing from the requirement to celebrate. This baraita could therefore refer to either a widower or a young man. If it refers to a widower, then he recites the blessing for one day, but celebrates for three.

To R. Meir, this refers to the fetuses in their mother\u2019s wombs when Israel crossed the sea. The Israelites rejoicing at going free extended even to the unborn babies.", "9": "Why doesn\u2019t R. Abahu agree with R. Nahman/R. Meir\u2019s derashah on the verse from Psalms?<br>Abahu responds that if the verse meant to refer to the unborn babies it should have specifically said \u201cfrom the womb.\u201d Since it uses a different word, \u201cfrom the fountain,\u201d it must refer to something else, and that is the \u201cmatters of the fountain\u201d which seems to refer to something broader than the fetus, perhaps sexuality in a broader sense.", "10": "Introduction<br>Having explained how R. Nahman uses the verse R. Abahu used to prove that the bridegroom\u2019s blessing requires a minyan, the Talmud now asks the opposite question\u2014what does R. Abahu do with R. Nahman\u2019s blessing?", "11": "According to R. Nahman, Boaz assembled ten men for an entirely different purpose and not so that he could recite the blessing. Rather, Boaz wanted to teach the elders that the Torah prohibits only male Ammonites and Moabites from marrying into Israel (Deuteronomy 23:4), not a female Ammonite or Moabite. This is important because Ruth, the progenitor of King David, is a Moabitess. Boaz needed a midrash to allow him to marry her in the first place.<br>To prove this point, R. Nahman points out that if all Boaz needed was a minyan, the people he assembled did not have to be elders. The fact that Boaz assembled elders means that they were there for more than just the blessing.", "12": "Abahu responds to R. Nahman\u2019s understanding of why Boaz needed ten. If the whole point was to teach the elders the midrash that the Torah prohibits male Ammonites and Moabites from marrying into Israel but not females, then why did he need a minyan. According to R. Abahu the fact that he specifically searched for ten is proof that he did so because without ten the blessing could not be recited. Ten would not have been necessary just to teach a midrash.<br>Nahman responds that the ten were needed to publicize the halakhah that Boaz had expounded. Without ten word would not have gotten out that only male Ammonites and Moabites are prohibited. This corresponds with a statement that Shmuel makes to R. Hanna of Baghdad concerning an entirely different topic altogether. The topic is whether one can transfer ownership over something to an unborn fetus. According to Shmuel this is possible, but in the end the halakhah is that it is not. One cannot transfer ownership over a piece of property (be it an item or a field) to something that has been determined to not yet \u201cbe in the world.\u201d We might put this another way\u2014fetuses do not have property rights.", "13": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now turns its attention more fully to the bridegroom\u2019s blessing, as well as the blessing recited at betrothal. We should keep in mind that while we now recite both of these sets of blessings at the huppah, meaning at the time of marriage, in the Talmudic period, there was a large gap in time between betrothal and marriage, just as there is typically a gap in time today between (secular) betrothal and marriage. Today Jews might get engaged a long time before they are married, but this engagement is not \u201cJewish\u201d\u2014it has no legal consequences. The \u201cJewish\u201d betrothal takes place at the ring ceremony, minutes before marriage.", "14": "According to the first opinion, the bridegrooms\u2019 blessing is recited only in the bridegroom\u2019s home, when the wife moves in. This is basically the definition of marriage\u2014the couple begins to live together.<br>Judah says that the blessing is also recited earlier, at the point of betrothal. This seems to be a bit strange\u2014after all, they are not living together so how can they recite these blessings?<br>Abaye answers this question by saying that R. Judah\u2019s statement refers only to the region of Judah, where as we shall see later in the chapter, there was a custom for the husband and wife to be secluded before marriage. Since this seclusion might lead to sexual relations, they should already recite the blessing when she is still in her father\u2019s home.  But in other regions, the bridegrooms\u2019 blessing is recited only in the bridegroom\u2019s house.", "15": "This baraita introduces a new blessing\u2014the blessing over betrothal. Now we can see that there are two separate blessings for two separate occasions, the betrothal and marriage. The first blessing is recited in the house in which betrothal occurs, usually her father\u2019s house. The second blessing is recited at the bridegroom\u2019s house, when the woman moves in.", "16": "The Talmud now relates what we say for the betrothal blessing. God prohibited us (meaning men) from having relations with women we have already betrothed. This is a main feature of Jewish marital law. During the period of betrothal, the woman is prohibited from having relations with her husband, but if she has relations with another man, it is considered adultery.<br>Women become permitted to their husbands at the point of marriage.<br>The blessing uses the curious phrase \u201chuppah and kiddushin.\u201d This struck some commentators as strange because the kiddushin, the act of betrothal, precedes the act of marriage, the huppah. So why are they in reverse order?<br>My doctoral advisor, Professor Shamma Friedman answered this question in an article\u2014shorter word tends to come first in Hebrew pairs. Just sounds better!", "17": "In Jewish liturgy, some blessings are \u201ccomplex\u201d and some are \u201csimple.\u201d A complex blessing has an opening, \u201cBlessed are You\u2026\u201d and then a closing one as well. An example of this is the first blessing after Barkhu, or the first blessing of Birkat Hamazon, or the first blessing of the Amidah. Kiddush is also an example. Simple blessings have no conclusion. All blessings over things from which one benefits, such as food and smell, are simple blessings. Blessings over mitzvoth are also simple (tallit, tefillin, shofar and many others).<br>So the one who holds that a simple blessing is used for betrothal, holds that it is like blessings over mitzvoth or over things from which we derive benefit. After all, marriage is a mitzvah and people derive benefit from it.<br>In contrast, the one who holds that it is a complex blessing says that it is like Kiddush. After all, it too uses the word \u201csanctification\u201d so it really is like Kiddush.<br>Today the halakhah is that it is \u201ccomplex,\u201d like Kiddush, beginning and opening with \u201cBlessed are You\u2026\u201d ", "18": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section provides the text for what today is called \u201cthe sheva berakhot.\u201d There are actually only six blessings. The blessing over the wine was added in a later period. These blessings are called in the Talmud \u201cthe bridegrooms\u2019 blessing.\u201d I have not commented on the meanings of the blessings. Commentary and other translations can be found in siddurim.", "19": "According to the baraita, the bridegrooms\u2019 blessing is recited in front of ten people all week of the celebration. However, Rav Judah notes that this is true only if new guests come. If there are no new guests at a subsequent night, then the blessing is not recited."}, "12": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section deals with some laws concerning the sheva berachot, specifically how many blessings are recited, and for how long is the special invitation to birkat hamazon at a wedding feast recited.", "1": "Here we have a dispute over how many blessings the \u201cbridegrooms\u2019 blessings\u201d consist of. According to Rashi, whose commentary is based on the continuation of the sugya, the dispute is whether the second blessing, \u201cWho forms man\u201d is included. We should note that if it is included, then there seems to be a repetition in the second and third blessings. Both seem to say the same thing\u2014acknowledging God for creating humanity.", "2": "Levi who blesses five, would hold that God created (formed) only one human being, a two-sided figure, and then split that being in half, male and female. This is a well-known version of creation that appears not only in rabbinical literature, but in Plato as well. Since there was only one formation, only one blessing is recited.", "3": "The Talmud now says that both R. Assi and Levi believed that human beings were created only once. So how do we understand the discrepancy in the verses, one implying that God created one human being, and then another, and the other verse implying that God created two from the outset. The answer is that God originally intended to create a separate male and female. But in the end, it turned out that God created one human being, and then later separated them.<br>There are clearly deep theological and anthropological implications to this passage. Why wasn\u2019t God\u2019s original intent fulfilled? Why did God want to create the sexes separately? What does this teach us about human beings that they were created at the same time?", "4": "Rav Ashi now outlines a procedure for signifying through blessings how long into the wedding celebration we are. We should note that the periodization here is similar to that in mourning. The most intense period is the first week, after that the next thirty days, and then as well shall see the next period is twelve months.<br>The blessing \u201cIn whose dwelling there is joy\u201d is today recited as part of the zimmun, the invitation to birkat hamazon. After the wedding, the sheva berachot are recited as part of birkat hamazon and not independently.<br>The customs reflected in this passage are no longer observed. Today, we recite all the sheva berakhot for the first seven days, but only if there are new guests. After the seventh day, no one recites any of these special blessings anymore. The special zimmun for birkat hamazon is recited for seven days, but not longer.", "5": "Ashi did not give an upper limit with regard to how long the special blessing, \u201cIn whose dwelling there is joy\u201d can possibly recited. R. Papi limits its recitation to a year. This is also the maximum time of mourning.", "6": "The question here is when do they begin saying this special blessing, \u201cIn whose dwelling there is joy\u201d begin. At first Rav Papa answers that we begin saying the blessing when \u201cthey put barley in the mortar.\u201d Rashi offers two explanations. The first is that this refers to making some sort of beer from the barley. This would be the first preparation for the wedding. I should note that Rav Papa was known to be a brewer. The second explanation is that they would plant barley in a pot as a symbol of \u201cbe fruitful and multiply.\u201d Nice custom, although I might prefer the beer!<br>The problem is that Rav Papa, when preparing for his own son\u2019s wedding, would say the blessing earlier, from the time of betrothal.<br>The answer is that Rav Papa was sure that all the preparations for the wedding were already made. Therefore, he could say the blessing earlier. In other cases, the blessing should not be recited till the preparations are made. Today, since betrothal and the wedding both take place under the huppah, no special blessing is made until then.", "7": "Here we can see the problem with reciting the blessing too early. Ravina said the blessing at the time of betrothal, claiming that he was certain that they would not retract. In the end, they did retract and annul the betrothal. It seems that he was testing luck.", "8": "Rav Tahlifa said six blessings, but made them all long. The difference between this practice, and that described above comes in the first two blessings. In the above version these were short blessings, opening with \u201cBlessed are You,\u201d but without any \u201cBlessed are You\u201d conclusion. In contrast, Rav Tahlifa lengthened them both, opening and ending them with \u201cBlessed are You.\u201d The halakhah does not follow Rav Tahlifa. The first two blessings are short blessings.<br>We can see here that the precise text of the \u201cbridegrooms\u2019 blessing\u201d was still fluid during the Talmudic period. From other evidence (the Tosefta, and some post-talmudic works), we also know that in Eretz Yisrael they recited three blessings. In general blessings and other parts of the liturgy were not yet all standardized in the Talmudic period.", "9": " Rav Habiba recited this blessing even at the house of a circumcision. But the anonymous Talmud rejects this, saying that a circumcision is not unadulterated joy. The child experiences pain, and therefore we do not say, \u201cIn whose dwelling there is joy.\u201d ", "10": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section discusses whether the bridegroom or mourner counts towards the minyan (quorum of ten) necessary to recite the bridegrooms\u2019 blessing or the mourner\u2019s blessing. Note that the Talmud is now transitioning to a discussion of both wedding customs and mourning customs. There are indeed many, many parallels between the two. I have a whole book at home on the topic. Clearly the rabbis shaped the two intentionally to have so many similarities. In this way, the two most critical moments in a person\u2019s existence, marriage and death, are parallel.", "11": "According to the early amoraic sage, Rav, while bridegrooms count towards the minyan required to recite the special blessings, the mourners do not.<br>However, a baraita says that in both cases, they count towards the minyan.<br>The Talmud resolves this difficulty by noting that Rav is different from all other amoraim. For the most part, the Talmud holds that amoraim may not disagree with tannaim. If they do, they must find some way to resolve the difficulty (this is what usually happens). No resolution and the amora loses (rare, but it does occur). However, Rav lived right at the beginning of what is considered the amoraic period. He is therefore considered a tanna and may disagree with other tannaim.", "12": "This is the same statement and difficulty from above. Again, the amora says that mourners do not count in the minyan, whereas the baraita cited as a difficulty says that they do.<br>This time, the difficulty must be resolved. The mourners count when it comes to the minyan required to recite the special birkat hamazon for mourners (we will read more about this later). But when it comes to the line after the funeral in which mourners are comforted, they do not count. This seems to make intuitive sense. In the line, the mourners are separate from the comforters. Therefore, they do not count. But at the meal, the mourners eat just as those giving comfort eat. Therefore, the mourners count."}, "13": {"0": "Above we said that R. Yohanan does not require a minyan of mourners only at the line of comforters. The problem is that here he refers to the blessing for the mourners, and this blessing is not recited in the line of comforters.<br>Therefore, the Talmud adjusts the above resolution. R. Yohanan refers to the blessing recited in the plaza. According to Rashi, this refers to the first meal fed to the mourner after the funeral. They would do this in the town square. At this occasion, mourners do not count in the minyan.", "1": "Finally, we have yet another statement by R. Yohanan. Here he refers to the blessing said over the mourners all seven days. Above, we said that this blessing does not require a minyan when in the plaza. The problem is that this blessing done only during the first day.<br>The Talmud answers that there could be a blessing in the plaza for seven days if new guests come.<br>I should note that this is clearly a resolution of the Talmud. The meal/blessings in the plaza were done only during the first day, upon returning from the funeral. This is an excellent example of the Talmud\u2019s propensity to \u201cmake things up\u201d even when they don\u2019t match reality.", "2": "Introduction<br>The story in this section is mainly a eulogy offered for the child of R. Hiyya bar Abba. I warn you, the eulogy does not contain the kind words you might expect on such an occasion. This story begins a series of \u201cderashot\u201d offered by a person who seems to be a professional eulogizer. It seems that these eulogies are not tailored to each individual who dies, but are more like stock poetic remarks to offer at a funeral depending. At most they are slightly tailored to the circumstance. Eulogies were important in the Talmudic period, but they were conducted very differently from how they are done today, at least in the traditions I\u2019m familiar with from the western world.", "3": "Resh Lakish, the father of the student of R. Hiyya bar Abba does not go to comfort R. Hiyya on the first day of his mourning. It is not clear why not. The next day, Resh Lakish shows up with his \u201cmeturgaman.\u201d Sometimes this means \u201ctranslator\u201d but here it clearly refers to a professional eulogizer. Resh Lakish tells the unnamed eulogizer to say something about the child who has just died.", "4": "The meturgaman opens with a verse and then offers a midrash on this verse to explain why R. Hiyya bar Abba\u2019s son died. God was angry over the sins of the generation.<br>Obviously, the theology expressed here is troublesome to our modern minds (and to the Talmud, as we shall see below). But I\u2019d like to focus more on the form of the eulogy. First of all, it is extremely short. It is basically just a verse, and a short interpretation. Second, clearly the meturgaman does not know the child, and maybe not even the family. This seems to be more of a formal lament, than what we would today term a eulogy. I understand that we today would not want our or our loved one\u2019s eulogies conducted in this manner. What is interesting to me is to look at the record of how they did this in the past.", "5": "This is a second version of the \u201ceulogy\u201d which seems to fit the case better if the son of R. Hiyya that died was a \u201cyoung man\u201d and not a child. The verse from Isaiah specifically mentions \u201cyoung men\u201d and blames the person himself for his own sins, and not the fathers, as was the previous \u201ceulogy.\u201d Again, it seems to me that this is a stock eulogy. Scholars say that in the past people tended to have less of an individual identity. People were simply part of a group. I do not know if this is always true, but these eulogies do seem to express that world view. The eulogy is not personal, it matches the person\u2019s age and to a certain extent the circumstances of their death. But that\u2019s it. The eulogizer says nothing about the person\u2019s life. Today in the age of individuality, we would of course expect the eulogy to address the unique aspects of the person who passed away.", "6": "Before discussing the eulogy itself, the Talmud interprets the phrase \u201cHis hand is still stretched out.\u201d This implies that God\u2019s judgment is still hanging. Even if a person\u2019s fate has already been sealed in the books of heaven, things could still go wrong.<br>What is it that a person could do to overturn his good judgement? According to this sugya, it is something as trivial as saying explicitly why the bride is going into the bridal chamber. Everybody knows what is to happen there, but this is a private matter. [If you don\u2019t know what happens in the bridal chamber, I am not saying. I don\u2019t want my decree overturned!]. The wedding in essence is a public celebration of something that should be a private matter between a husband and wife. The rabbis were concerned that the private aspects remain as such.", "7": "The Talmud questions the content of the meturgaman\u2019s eulogy\u2014how could he be so crass as to say to R. Hiyya bar Abba that your son died because of your sins?<br>The answer is that only the righteous (and their families) are punished for the sins of their generations. I\u2019m not sure how comforting this may be to R. Hiyya bar Abba, but at least he is not saying that his own son died because of his father\u2019s sins.", "8": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section, Resh Lakish\u2019s professional meturgaman delivered a eulogy for the child who had died. The meturgaman, who seems to be a professional liturgist/poet, is now asked to recite other formal blessings customarily recited at the home of a mourner.<br>I should note that there is a rich history to these blessings, either as part of a special birkat hamazon said at the home of a mourner, or as independent blessings. These blessings are no longer recited. They seem to have been lost at some point during the period of the geonim (post-Talmudic period, roughly 700-1100 C.E.).", "9": "The first blessing after the eulogy is about God\u2019s greatness. We should note that this is parallel to the first blessing of birkat hamazon, where we bless God for providing food. God is great for sustaining the people of this world, and for the resuscitation of the dead.", "10": "This blessing is about the mourners, offering them comfort for their bereavement. This blessing has some affinities with the third blessing of birkat hamazon, in which we mourn the loss of Jerusalem. Indeed, there are other texts that combine these two ideas\u2014comforting the people over their personal loss, as well as their national loss for Jerusalem.", "11": "Abaye says that one should not \u201copen one\u2019s mouth to Satan\u201d by acknowledging that death will continue to occur. Abaye wants to mourn the loss of the individual but to a certain extent deny death, by hoping that death will cease occurring.", "12": "The final blessing in these series is for those who comfort the mourners. Again, we can see some similarities between this blessing and the fourth blessing of birkat hamazon. The fourth blessing focuses on reward, \u201cHe rewarded us, He rewards us and He will reward us.\u201d It is not hard to imagine how these two blessings could be combined together.<br>The blessing mentions Abraham who is considered in Jewish lore the father of acts of loving kindness. ", "13": "Introduction<br>Today concludes the last of the blessings recited at the mourner\u2019s home.", "14": "In this last blessing we ask God to save us from all sorts of catastrophes. The liturgy is similar to the words used in other blessings, including the \u201cbirkat haderekh\u201d the travelers\u2019 blessing.", "15": "Ulla cites a baraita according to which they drank ten (!) cups of wine at the home of a mourner. Six cups were functional\u2014to ease digestion. Four more were drunk after the meal, one corresponding to each of the blessings of the birkat hamazon.", "16": "As if ten cups of wine were not sufficient, according to the baraita, they added four more! The additional cups were in honor of various functionaries in the city, as well as Rabban Gamaliel. Alas, fourteen cups was determined to be too much, so they went back to only ten cups of wine. (Reminds me of the old joke about the rabbi who instructed the man to bring the animals into his house. Ten cups doesn\u2019t look like so much in comparison with fourteen).", "17": "The Talmud explains the reference to Rabban Gamaliel\u2014what is his connection with Jewish funerals? The answer is that Rabban Gamaliel is the sage who began the wise practice to limit the costs of a funeral. Before his time, burial had become an opportunity for people to show off their wealth. The costs of the funeral became so burdensome that people began abandon their dead. Rabban Gamaliel did not just tell the people to cease this practice. He directed that his own funeral should be simple, and that he should be buried in simple shrouds. Jewish funerals were never the same.<br>Interestingly, just last week a group that deals with Jewish burial and mourning practices all over the world came to visit the Yeshiva. The name of the group? Gamaliel."}, "14": {"0": "Introduction<br>After a long digression about the blessings recited at weddings and funerals or homes of mourners, the Talmud now returns to the main subject of the chapter: virginity and virginity claims.<br>I wish to remind the reader that I adopt a clinical tone when discussing these passages. I try to offer an accurate description of what I believe the rabbis are talking about. The immediate topic of these passages, virginity claims, is not practical halakhah anymore, nor was it observed very much throughout Jewish history. But the abstract principles discussed over the next few pages were of great interest to Talmudic thinkers for many generations, and made this one of the most learned pieces of Talmud in the entire Bavli.", "1": "Rabbi Elazar refers to a completely subjective type of virginity claim, according to which the husband simply says that his wife did not feel to him like she was a virgin. This is different from the virginity claim referred to in the Torah and in earlier rabbinic literature, which was a claim based on the lack of blood.<br>We should note that Rabbi Elazar also refers to a consequence of a virginity claim that we have never heard of before\u2014the wife is prohibited to the husband. The Mishnah spoke about her losing her ketubah payment (200 for a first marriage). In other words, the tannaim referred to a claim that was in the realm of financial matters, whereas the amoraim discuss the issue in terms of personal/religious consequences.<br>What Rabbi Elazar seems to be saying is that if a husband does not have the evidence to successfully prove that his wife was not a virgin, i.e. he does not have any evidence to prove that she did not bleed, but he still believes that she is not a virgin due to his subjective feeling, he may not continue to live with her, for we fear that she was an adulteress. This too is a shift from the halakhah in the Mishnah and in the Torah. In the earlier texts the problem with her not being a virgin was simply that the husband thought he was marrying a virgin. To put it crudely, he imagined he was buying a virgin, and he got a non-virgin, and therefore he wants his money back. Rabbi Elazar introduces a new fear\u2014that she had sex with a man besides her husband after she was already betrothed.", "2": "The Talmud points out that there are two possible reasons considered by her husband not to have been a virgin at the time of marriage is still permitted to him.<br>The first is that she may have had sex with another man before she was betrothed. This would mean that she is still permitted to her husband because she is not an adulteress. Only an adulteress is prohibited to her husband, not a woman who had premarital sex.<br>Second, even if she had sex once betrothed, she may have been raped and is therefore not an adulteress. A woman raped is not prohibited to her husband, as long as he is an Israelite.<br>Since there is a \u201cdouble doubt\u201d the halakhah should rule leniently and allow this man to stay with his wife, even though he believes her not to be a virgin.", "3": "There are two possible cases where there is not a double doubt with regard to her being prohibited to him, and therefore, Rabbi Elazar\u2019s rule would apply.<br>The first case is if she is married to a priest (Kohen). A kohen may not stay married to his wife if she has been raped. Therefore, we are left with only one doubt\u2014was it after or before betrothal?<br>The second case is where she was betrothed before she was three years old. In this case, even if she had been raped before three, the rabbis believed that her physical signs of virginity would return. Therefore, if her husband senses that she is not a virgin, we can be sure that she lost her virginity after betrothal. We are now left with only one doubt\u2014was it rape or was it willing adultery?<br>As I stated in the introduction above, the actual halakhah here is not what interested Talmudic commentators. What interested them far more was the principle\u2014what do we do in cases of doubt? One principle we learn here is that if there are two doubts, the law can be lenient.<br>I should also note that throughout these passages, the woman does not explain or otherwise respond to her husband\u2019s claim that she was not a virgin. There are some stories coming up later where she does respond. But in the abstract halakhic discussions, we do not know her response.", "4": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section Rabbi Elazar stated that a man who believes that his wife was not a virgin when they first had sex, is believed to cause her to be prohibited to him.<br>In a somewhat strange twist, after criticizing Rabbi Elazar for being wrong, the Talmud now criticizes him for being \u201ctoo right.\u201d", "5": "The Talmud believes that the same principle taught by Rabbi Elazar can be derived from this Mishnah. In this Mishnah, a man says to a woman \u201cI betrothed you\u201d but she denies that the betrothal occurred. The consequence of this statement is certainly not that she is betrothed\u2014after all, she denied that it was true. Rather, the consequences are for him alone. He may not marry any of her close relatives, for according to him, he betrothed this woman. This is the same principle as that which underlies Rabbi Elazar\u2019s statement\u2014a man can say something and cause a woman to be prohibited to him based on his word alone.<br>She on the other hand is not prohibited from marrying his relatives because she says they were never betrothed.", "6": "If Rabbi Elazar had not stated his rule, that a man is believed to say \u201cI found an open opening,\u201d we might have said that he is believed only when he says \u201cI betrothed you\u201d because we can assume that about such a matter he is certain. After all, he knows what he said. But whether she was a virgin or not is subjective; he knows what he felt, but he cannot possibly know if his assessment was correct. Therefore, we might have said he is not believed in that case. Therefore, Rabbi Elazar says that he is believed.", "7": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now questions whether Rabbi Elazar actually said that if a husband says \u201cI found an open opening,\u201d i.e. he believes his wife was not a virgin at marriage, she becomes prohibited to him.", "8": "The Talmud cites another statement by Rabbi Elazar that seems to contradict the \u201copen opening\u201d statement. Rabbi Elazar refers to the laws of the sotah, the suspected adulteress. According to the rabbis, for a woman to become a sotah, and for her to be brought to the Temple to drink the bitter waters, the husband must perform two preliminary actions. First of all, he must warn her not to be secluded with a particular man. Second, she must be secluded with that man. This, according to Rabbi Elazar, is like \u201cthe occurrence that happened,\u201d which is assumed later on in this section to be a reference to the episode of David and Bathsheba. This episode is so scandalous, that the rabbis don\u2019t even want to refer to it by name.", "9": "This is not a difficulty, for thus he means to say: A wife does not become forbidden to her husband except in the case of warning and seclusion, [and this we learn] from the occurrence that happened, where there was no warning and seclusion and therefore she was not prohibited.<br>Before going on with the larger difficulty, the Talmud asks about this statement itself. The problem is that the story of David and Bathsheba did not have anything to do with warning and seclusion, and moreover, Batsheba did not become prohibited to David after. The sentence as it stands makes no sense.<br>To resolve this difficulty, the Talmud emends the statement. The reason that Bathsheba did not become prohibited to David was that it was not a case of \u201cwarning and seclusion.\u201d [This is entirely absurd\u2014David was not married to Bathsheba, and therefore could not possibly have warned her. What would he have said? Don\u2019t be secluded with me?].", "10": "The Talmud now turns to the original difficulty. Here Rabbi Elazar seems to say that the only way a woman can become prohibited to her husband is through a process of warning and seclusion. We could deduce from here that if a husband says, \u201cI found an open, opening\u201d he would not be believed to prohibit her to him.<br>But this exclusionary interpretation of this statement is absurd. If witnesses come and testify that a woman has committed adultery, it is obvious that she is prohibited to him. So how could we possibly think to say that she becomes prohibited only through warning and seclusion?<br>The Talmud therefore revises the statement (yet) again. One witness as to a woman\u2019s adultery is not sufficient for her to become prohibited to her husband. However, if he warns her and she is secluded, she is prohibited to him even if the seclusion was seen by only one witness. Finally, if he himself claims to have found \u201can open opening\u201d she is prohibited as if two witnesses saw her commit adultery.", "11": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned about the \u201coccurrence that happened\u201d which according to commentators is the incident of David and Bathsheba. Generally speaking an adulteress is prohibited from marrying the man with whom she committed adultery. The question, and it\u2019s not an easy one, is why was Bathsheba not prohibited to David. After all, she was an adulteress and she should not, according to rabbinic law, be allowed to become married to David.<br>I should put this question into perspective. In the Bible while David certainly committed two grave sins (murder and adultery) he was not punished, probably because he is God\u2019s chosen king. The rabbis, though, have to justify David with rabbinic halakhah. This is no easy feat, as we shall see.", "12": "The first answer to this question is not an easy one to read. An adulteress is prohibited from remaining married to her husband. But a woman who is raped is not an adulteress and is not prohibited from her husband. She did nothing wrong. Here, and only here, we read of a corollary\u2014just as a raped woman is permitted to stay married to her husband, she is permitted to marry her rapist (I understand that she would not want to, but technically this would be permitted). So if David raped Bathsheba, he could still marry her.<br>Obviously, this is morally repulsive and also difficult to accord with the simple reading of the Bible. There is little evidence that David raped Bathsheba, beyond the general consideration that the king is powerful and it is not possible for women to refuse him. Indeed, to my knowledge there are no other places in rabbinic literature where the incident is portrayed as rape. Nevertheless, this allows the rabbis to solve the halakhic conundrum of how David was allowed to marry Bathsheba."}, "15": {"0": "This second interpretation is more normative. David was allowed to marry Bathsheba because Uriah had divorced her before going into battle. This midrash is reflective of the rabbinic halakhah that soldiers should divorce their wives before going to battle. This would prevent her from becoming an \u201cagunah\u201d should he die and his whereabouts not be known. Thus Bathsheba was not married when David had relations with her. Elsewhere the rabbis find ways to justify his murder of Uriah.", "1": "Introduction<br>In this section Abaye tries to bring tannaitic support for R. Elazar\u2019s rule that one who says, \u201cI found an open opening\u201d is believed.", "2": "Abaye quotes the Mishnah with its Talmudic explanation. A virgin is married on Wednesday so that a husband can get to the court before his anger at her for not being a virgin has cooled off.", "3": "Who cares if he cools off, asks the Talmud? What negative result might happen by his anger subsiding and his not making a virginity claim against her?<br>If the issue is financial, meaning we fear that he will not go to the court to protest paying her the ketubah, why should we care about this? Let him give her the ketubah, even if she is really undeserving of it because she was not a virgin. A person can always give his money to whomever he so wishes.<br>Rather, the issue must be to cause her to be prohibited to him. We fear that he will cool down and stay with her even though she might be prohibited to him, because she committed adultery after marriage.", "4": "The final element that Abaye needs to prove is that this Mishnah refers to a husband who claims \u201cI found an open opening.\u201d There is simply no evidence that the Mishnah refers to such a situation. Rather, it could easily refer to the more normative claim a husband might make, that he did not find blood. Therefore, in the end the Mishnah is not proof that R. Elazar\u2019s rule is correct.", "5": "Introduction<br>In this sugya we read the Babylonian version of R. Elazar\u2019s law. A man who says that he found \u201can open opening\u201d is believed to cause his wife to lose her ketubah. We should note what a dangerous and problematic law this would be. A husband could make a purely subjective claim, based on no evidence, and use it to cause his wife to lose her ketubah, the money he guaranteed her at the wedding. This law was greatly hedged in later halakhic literature, especially in a series of stories we shall see in the next daf.", "6": "Rav Judah and Shmuel are Babylonian amoraim. They take R. Elazar\u2019s rule a step further. Not only is the husband believed to cause his wife to be prohibited to him, he is even believed to cause her to lose her ketubah.", "7": "Rav Joseph cites a Mishnah that he believes states the same rule as Rav Judah, making it superfluous. The Mishnah rules that if a husband eats at his father in law\u2019s house before the marriage, he loses the right to make a virginity claim because he was secluded with her. We will learn this Mishnah in a couple of pages. For now, he uses it to prove that while one cannot make a virginity claim in Judea, he can make it in the Galilee, which here is a code word for all other places.", "8": "As we did in yesterday\u2019s section, the Talmud now asks what the effectivity of this claim is. If it is just to prohibit her to him, then why can\u2019t he make such a claim in Judea? After, all, a husband should always be able to claim that his wife is prohibited to him and then separate from her. Indeed, if he thinks she is prohibited to him, he can just separate from her and that\u2019s it.<br>Therefore, it must be that this Mishnah refers to a husband making a virginity claim to cause her to lose her ketubah. Such a claim is effective in the Galilee, or anywhere else besides Judea.", "9": "For this Mishnah to teach the same rule as Rav Judah, the husband must be making a claim of \u201cI found an open opening.\u201d But again, there is no evidence that this is the husband\u2019s claim in the Mishnah. Rather, it is far more likely that he is making the claim we hear about in the Mishnah all of the time, the claim of no blood. There is no evidence that Rav Judah\u2019s rule is found in the Mishnah."}, "16": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section tries to find support for why a husband should be believed when he states that he found \u201can open opening.\u201d", "1": "Rav Nahman points out that it was the rabbis who determined that a woman should receive a ketubah, 200 for a virgin, 100 for a second time marriage. Since they enacted that she should get the money in the first place, they can shape the law such that if a husband claims that he found his wife not to be a virgin, he is believed. In other words, the rabbis giveth and the rabbis taketh away.<br>I should note that this is in essence like saying, \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is\u201d to an irrational law. A husband should not simply be believed to say that his wife is not a virgin. Since he is causing her a loss of money, he should have to bring evidence, as is always the case in civil suits. After all, there is ample reason for why he would lie.", "2": "This section offers a better explanation of why the husband is believed. It begins by questioning why the rabbis enacted the ketubah just to allow it to be taken away.<br>In Talmudic times the husband would have paid for the wedding feast. A husband would not have spent this huge amount of money just to go and falsely libel his wife by claiming that she was not a virgin. Therefore, when he makes this claim, he is believed.<br>We should of course note that this is an assumption. Some husbands might indeed lie about their wives, despite the fact that this will cause them to lose their expenditures on the wedding feast. Nevertheless, it does at least point to a factor in the equation. The husband has spent a large amount of resources in making this wedding happen. The assumption that he would not just throw it away does have some legal weight.", "3": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section the claim was made that the rabbis enacted the ketubah, the marriage document that guarantees a woman money at the time of her divorce or her husband\u2019s death. Today\u2019s section questions the source of the ketubah\u2014is it from the Torah or is it a rabbinic enactment.", "4": "A baraita states that since a ketubah is a fine, a sort of penalty on the husband, if he pays out this money, he may give her from the worst land on his property. This is the general rule with rabbinic fines/enactments\u2014they may be paid out from the worst type of land. In contrast, debts would have to be paid out of higher quality land and damages would need to be paid out of the best land.<br>The Talmud emends \u201cfine\u201d to \u201cenactment.\u201d A ketubah is not a fine, it is an enactment of the rabbis, or at least so it was claimed in yesterday\u2019s section.<br>In contrast, Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel holds that it is from the Torah. The Talmud will now explore this opinion.", "5": "The verse from Exodus refers to case where a man has seduced a virgin\u2014he slept with her without first marrying her with her father\u2019s permission. The Torah rules that the husband must pay her the \u201cbride-price\u201d of the virgins, which in Deuteronomy corresponds to 50 shekels. Since the Torah\u2019s shekel is believed to be worth four dinars in rabbinic/Roman money, this is considered the source of the amount of the ketubah, 200 dinars. The rabbis from here say that this is also support for the notion that the ketubah, the marriage document, is of \u201cdeoraita\u201d\u2014toraitic\u2014status.<br>Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that the status of the ketubah is \u201cfrom the scribes\u201d elsewhere known as \u201cderabanan.\u201d<br>I should note that the issue of the source of the ketubah is complex. People were getting married with marriage documents for thousands of years before the rabbinic period. The Torah certainly did not invent the notion of the ketubah. And clearly the amount of the rabbinic ketubah is derived from the Torah\u2019s fifty shekels. The argument here seems to be an issue of legal status, not an issue of origins.<br>In any case, this baraita contradicts the earlier baraita, in which Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said that the ketubah was from the Torah.", "6": "To solve the difficulty the Talmud reverses the opinions in the second baraita, such that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah in both baraitot.<br>However, the Talmud asks why reverse the opinions in the second baraita\u2014why not reverse the opinions in the first baraita such that they accord?", "7": "The answer is that there is yet another source that implies that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah. In a Mishnah found at the end of this tractate R. Shimon ben Gamaliel says that if a man marries a woman in Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) but then divorces her in Israel, he must pay Cappadocian coins, which the Talmud believes to be worth more than coins from Israel. This is because R. Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah, and therefore he must pay the debt he incurred in the place where he incurred it, as is the case with all debts. If the ketubah was of derabanan status, he would have been able to pay her with the lesser currency.", "8": "This is an alternative resolution. Instead of switching the baraita\u2019s opinion, the Talmud emends the whole thing, such that it is all the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel. Instead of him saying that the ketubah is derabanan, he adds that the ketubah for a widow (or any second marriage) is only from the scribes\u2014it is of derabanan status.", "9": "Introduction<br>We now begin a most fascinating series of stories of men coming in front of rabbis with virginity claims against their wives. Most interesting is that in none of these cases does the man \u201cwin\u201d the case. He always loses, although in various ways. In my opinion this is often the function of aggadah\u2014to balance out the halakhah. The halakhah increasingly believed men who made virginity claims. This may have functioned to deter women from losing their virginity before marriage, at least in the eyes of the rabbis. On the other hand, actually believing husbands is a dangerous thing, for a husband could lie just to get his wife to lose her ketubah. Therefore, these stories serve as precedents that a judge could use to have some flexibility with which to rule against the husband.", "10": "As a response to the man\u2019s claim that he found an \u201copen opening\u201d R.

Such a man deserves to be beaten.<br>Note what a deterrent to making a virginity claim this would have been. Sure, come make your virginity claim, but run the risk of being beaten.", "11": "The problem is that R. Nahman himself had said that a husband who makes a virginity claim is believed.<br>There are two answers to this. The first is that he is believed, but that they also lash him. This would seem to mean that there is still a significant deterrent to making the claim.<br>The second answer is based on R. Nahman\u2019s assumption that he gained his sexual experience with prostitutes. This would be true only for a young man, assumedly a virgin. If he was married, then he could have gained his experience legally, in which case he is believed and he is not lashed.", "12": "This time a man comes in front of Rabban Gamaliel, again claiming that he found an \u201copen opening.\u201d Using a parable Rabban Gamaliel accuses him of \u201cmoving aside.\u201d This is an activity that was alluded to earlier in the chapter, whereby a man can have sex without causing his wife to lose her virginity.

Ashi\u2019s response now implies that virginity claims such as these could not be made at all in Babylonia.

His wife is found to be a virgin and the couple are sent on their way.<br>The Talmud then asks why Rabban Gamaliel had to go through the test with the handmaidens. If this is a \u201cscientific\u201d method, why not just check her right away. The answer is telling\u2014this is not such a scientific method. Rabban Gamaliel needed to prove its effectiveness before testing it out for real.<br>I\u2019ve often wondered whether this whole \u201ctest\u201d was an elaborate set-up to prove to the gullible husband that his wife is a virgin. Rabban Gamaliel would make sure that he has ready two handmaids, one whose breath smells of wine, and one whose breath does not. The husband would believe this to be science, and he would go home with his wife. In this way, Rabban Gamaliel would bring peace between a husband and his wife.", "2": "In this case, the woman claims that she is from a family, known as \u201cDorkati\u201d whose women do not bleed\u2014neither menstrual blood nor virginal blood. Rabban Gamaliel checks with her family and finds that this is true, the women of her family do not bleed. He now sends the husband on his way, telling him how lucky he is to have married into a family with this genetic quality.", "3": "The rabbis play here on the word \u201cDorkati\u201d which sounds like \u201cdor katua\u201d\u2014a cut-off generation. This implies that a woman who does not have menstrual blood will not be fertile. [Of course, this calls into question how such a quality could be genetic in the first place].", "4": "Two amoraim here dispute what Rabban Gamaliel said to the husband. Was marrying a woman from the \u201cDorkati\u201d family a \u201cmerit\u201d or a \u201cliability\u201d?<br>We can understand why it would be called a liability\u2014R. Hanina said that such a woman is infertile.<br>But why might Rabban Gamaliel have said, \u201cBe happy\u201d? What is there to be happy about? The answer is that he won\u2019t ever have to worry that he is having relations with his wife while she is menstruating. This was a serious transgression in the eyes of the rabbis, and while I think most would choose fertility, at least it is some consolation. You might say that Rabban Gamaliel was trying to find the silver lining in the situation.", "5": "In this case Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] sees that these people are just too starving to really be having sexual intercourse successfully. The wife knows that they have not successfully had sex and that she is still a virgin. Rabbi kindly orders them to be fed and bathed. They are then allowed to be intimate again, and the husband finds that his wife indeed was a virgin. I think this is a really important message for rabbis. Their job is to solve problems, to make peace. All of these rabbis could have ruled strictly. But each in their own way found a way out of the problem and a solution such that the couple could continue to live together in marriage. They would have made good marriage counsellors.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins a new Mishnah. [Congrats, you\u2019ve made it to the second Mishnah!]<br>The sugya on this Mishnah is really not about the Mishnah, but about a few words in the Mishnah. My commentary on the Mishnah is taken from Mishnah Yomit.", "7": "Section one:  This section provides the basic halakhah that will be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter. Assumedly there are two reasons why a widow (which in this context includes a divorcee) receives a smaller ketubah.  First of all, she already received a ketubah from her first marriage, and therefore has some money already saved up.  Second, and probably more importantly, there was a need to encourage men to marry widows and divorcees.  Most men probably preferred first-time marriages.  Second marriages were made cheaper, therefore, to prevent older women from remaining husband-less.  Needless to say, that people should be married was an important value to the rabbis.<br>Section two:  The Mishnah now begins to discuss exceptional cases, ones which slightly deviate from the typical first marriage or the typical widow or divorcee.  If a woman has been betrothed, but then was divorced before marriage or her husband died before the marriage was completed is in one sense a virgin and in one sense not.  She is a virgin in that she has never had sexual relations, but she is a widow or divorcee as well. [Note that in Hebrew the word for virgin \u201cbetulah\u201d can mean either a woman whose physical signs of virginity are intact or it can mean a young woman who has never been married.  The same ambiguity occurs in the Greek word, \u201cparthenon\u201d.]  According to our mishnah, such a woman receives a full ketubah, should she remarry.<br>A \u201chalutzah\u201d is a woman who has been released from levirate marriage, the obligation to marry one\u2019s dead husband\u2019s brother.", "8": "Hana of Baghdad makes a pun on the word \u201calmanah\u201d which means \u201cwidow.\u201d It refers to the \u201cmaneh,\u201d the one hundred zuz, that she receives for her marriage contract.<br>The rabbis now ask some nitpicky questions on what was just a play on words.<br>The problem is that sometimes a widow could receive a ketubah of more than a \u201cmaneh.\u201d As we saw in the above Mishnah, if she is widowed before betrothal, she gets two hundred zuz, under the assumption that she is still a virgin.<br>This question is easily answered\u2014since most widows receive a \u201cmaneh,\u201d all widows are called \u201calmanah.\u201d<br>But the next problem is a little more interesting. The Torah uses the word \u201calmanah\u201d and yet it was the rabbis, who lived much later, who determined that a widow should receive a ketubah of a maneh. There is an anachronism here\u2014how can the Torah use a word based on a halakhah that does not yet exist?<br>The answer is that the Torah called her \u201calmanah\u201d based on the fact that the rabbis will in the future give her such a ketubah.", "9": "The Talmud asks whether something can be named in the Torah based on future events. And the answer is affirmative. The Torah refers to Ashur, which R. Joseph explains as referring to the area known as Seleucia, today identified with modern Syria/Lebanon.

Joseph is not making a pun based on future rabbinic law, as did R. Hana of Baghdad. He is simply identifying an area of the world mentioned in the Torah based on its future name, just as I identified \u201cSeleucia\u201d with modern Syria.]", "10": "R.

We might note that it\u2019s not hard to find \u201cmem\u201d words considering that one of Hebrew\u2019s verb constructs begins with \u201cmem.\u201d<br>Evidently we need proof for the idea that rain helps the ground.

The commentary on the Mishnah is from Mishnah Yomit.", "1": "In order to understand this mishnah we must understand a few things.  First of all, all of the women mentioned in this mishnah are assumed to have already had sex.  It was assumed that female captives were raped by their captors and therefore a woman who had been taken captive was assumed to no longer be a virgin.  It was also assumed that non-Jews were extremely licentious, and that they would have sex with young girls (I realize that this is extremely bigoted, but there probably was some degree of truth to it in the world in which the rabbis lived).  Therefore a woman who converted was assumed to have already had sex.  Thirdly, it was assumed that slaves were licentious or perhaps were commonly raped by their masters.  In any case, they too were categorically not considered virgins.  Seemingly all three of these types of women should have ketuboth of one maneh [=100 zuz] and their husbands should not be able to claim that they weren\u2019t virgins, because they were married under the assumption that they were not virgins.  However, the other assumption that the mishnah makes is that if a girl is raped before the age of three, her signs of virginity will eventually heal and return [this medical assumption was not unique to the rabbis].  Therefore if these women made the transition from slave to free Jew or proselyte to Jew or from captive to being freed before the age of three, it was assumed that their virginity would return and they could be assumed to be virgins.<br>A note about the Mishnah\u2019s references to sexual intercourse with young girls:<br>The Mishnah will occasionally reference sexual relations with young girls, even under the age of three.  I expect that this will cause discomfort to people reading the mishnah, and when I think of my own six year old daughter, this makes me queasy as well.  We would do well to realize that the Mishnah\u2019s discussion of all legal possibilities does not imply its tacit approval of them.  The Mishnah discusses many crimes without expressing horror over them, because the Mishnah is often interested in legal consequences. The rabbis certainly did not condone sexual relations with girls this young.", "2": "The sugya opens without any connection to the Mishnah. The topic is the conversion of minors. There is a problem with the conversion of minors\u2014how do we know that they want to convert? For an adult this is of course not a problem, but Jewish conversion is consensual. So how can it be done for a child? R. Huna innovates that it can be done by the court taking on the child\u2019s consent.<br>If anyone is interested I wrote a scholarly paper on this subject. It can be found on academia.edu. The point of the paper was to prove that in earlier times conversion was not a process that required a court.", "3": "What you might have said? A non-Jew prefers a life without restraint because it is established for us that a slave certainly prefers a life without restraint, therefore, he teaches us that this is said only in the case of an adult who has already tasted sin, but [in the case of] a minor, it is an advantage to him.<br>The Talmud now analyzes what we would have thought had R. Huna not issued his statement. Conversion is an advantage for a person, for he joins the Jewish people. Therefore, it should be obvious that a minor can be converted in his \u201cabsence,\u201d i.e. before he is old enough to consent. So what does R. Huna really teach us?<br>The answer is that without R. Huna\u2019s statement we might have thought that it is not such a pure advantage to convert. After all, many things that were permitted before are now prohibited. R. Huna lets us know that this is only true for an adult who has \u201ctasted the forbidden fruit.\u201d For a child who does not yet know how sweet this fruit is, conversion remains an advantage.", "4": "The Talmud now mentions our Mishnah. The Mishnah referred to a minor convert. But again, we must ask, how can a minor convert? The answer could be through R. Huna\u2019s law\u2014on the consent of the court. This would mean that there is tannaitic support for R. Huna.<br>But this support is rejected. The Mishnah may refer to a case where the child converts with his/her parents. In such a case we don\u2019t really need the consent of the court, for we can assume that the child would want to convert with the parents.<br>In the end, the Talmud understands R. Huna as referring to a child who converts without his parents, perhaps a foundling. In truth, it is not easy to understand how such a situation could actually arise.", "5": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues discussing the minor convert.", "6": "Joseph adds in a giant caveat to R. Huna\u2019s ruling about minor conversion. Minors can convert based on the consent of the court. But since they did not themselves consent to their conversion, they can reject and undo their conversion when they reach majority age (assumedly 12 or 13, although this is not stated here). This is completely sui generis in the laws of conversion. In all other cases, once one converts it cannot be undone. Once a Jew, always a Jew.", "7": "As we have seen, the Mishnah assumes that minors can convert, The Mishnah describes the ketubah received by such a minor (although there is no reason to assume that she was married as a minor). The problem is that if she receives her ketubah, and then protests against her conversion, she will in essence get the ketubah and consume its profits as a Gentile woman. Basically, what I think Abaye is really trying to say is that tannaitic sources assume that conversion is permanent. If they thought that conversion could be undone, they would not have given such a woman a ketubah.", "8": "The resolution to Abaye\u2019s difficulty leads to an important limitation of R. Joseph\u2019s rule. At first the Talmud says that she would receive her ketubah only on reaching majority age. But this does not solve the problem\u2014she could still theoretically protest, revert to being a non-Jew and consume her ketubah while not Jewish.<br>As a result, the Talmud limits R. Joseph\u2019s rule. Once she is of majority age, she can no longer protest. In essence, by not protesting, she is at that point consenting to being Jewish. There is a very limited window of opportunity in which the convert could protest.", "9": "Rava\u2019s difficulty on R. Joseph is basically the same difficulty raised by Abaye, he just uses a different Mishnah. The Mishnah refers to the fine paid by a rapist or seducer. The fine is paid only if the girl is a virgin, but as long as she is Jewish, she receives it. The end of the list in this Mishnah (from chapter three, where it will be explained more fully) is the same as the list in our Mishnah. Again, it shows that a girl can convert while a minor. She would receive a fine because she is considered a virgin, and then she could protest on reaching majority age. Then she could consume this fine while a Gentile.", "10": "The resolution is the exact same as above.", "11": "Since both objections are basically the same, the Talmud now must ask why each amora chose to raise the difficulty from that particular Mishnah and not from the Mishnah used by the other amora.<br>Abaye could argue that the case of the fine is different, because we want the rapist/seducer to pay the fine even if she rejects her conversion. We don\u2019t want him to be rewarded by not having to pay the fine and so we might make him pay even if she could undo her conversion later in life. So this Mishnah is a special case and we cannot use it to prove that she is limited in her ability to protest her conversion.<br>Rava would argue that the case of the ketubah is also a special case. One of the functions of the ketubah is to deter divorce. As long as she has not protested, she remains a Jew and we do not want her husband to easily divorce her. So we might say that in she receives the ketubah even though she could \u201cundo\u201d her Jewishness later in life. This Mishnah is not proof that her ability to protest her conversion should be limited.", "12": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section really contains two mishnayot. The first discusses three types of women who don\u2019t fit into the normal categories of virgin/non-virgin.  This is either because they have had sexual intercourse but didn\u2019t lose their physical signs of virginity, or because they are not physically virgins, even though they never had intercourse.", "13": "There are three women mentioned in this mishnah.  The first is a young girl who had intercourse with an adult man.  As we mentioned in yesterday\u2019s mishnah, the Sages believed that if a girl has sexual intercourse before three, her hymen will regenerate when she gets older.  Therefore, when this girl gets older she will have her physical signs of virginity, even though she has had sexual intercourse.<br>The second woman is an adult woman who had sexual intercourse with a young boy.  According to the Sages a boy less than nine years old cannot have real intercourse, such that he causes a woman to lose her virginity.  Again, this woman has her physical signs of virginity, but she has had sexual intercourse.<br>The third woman is called a \u201cmukath etz\u201d, literally translated as \u201chit by a stick\u201d.  This refers to a woman who lost her hymen by something other than intercourse.  In our day we might say she went horseback riding.  This woman no longer has physical signs of virginity, but she has never had sexual intercourse.<br>According to Rabbi Meir, all three of these women receive a full ketubah.  According to Rabbi Meir in order to be considered a non-virgin a woman must have lost her physical signs of virginity through sexual intercourse.<br>The Sages rule that the \u201cmukath etz\u201d does not receive a full ketubah.  The Sages seem to define \u201cvirginity\u201d by physicality alone:  one who does not have her physical signs of virginity is not a \u201chalakhic\u201d virgin and does not receive a ketubah of 200 zuz.", "14": "This next mishnah teaches the opposite cases of those taught in mishnah two.<br>Introduction<br>Section one:  The women in this mishnah have been previously married, and not merely betrothed as were the women in mishnah two.  Nevertheless, they are still virgins for their husbands divorced them or died after entering the huppah (the wedding room) before having had sexual intercourse.  Note that this could certainly occur if the woman was menstruating at the time of marriage.  The mishnah rules that although these women are physically virgins, they are halakhically considered to be non-virgins and are treated as such. Their ketubah payment in a subsequent marriage will therefore be only a maneh and not the full 200 zuz.  If their husband in a subsequent marriage marries them and finds them not to be a virgin, he cannot make a virginity claim against them.  One reason that they are considered to be non-virgins is that by definition a woman who was once married can no longer be a virgin, for the word for virgin in Hebrew implies unmarried.  A second reason is that although the woman claims to be a virgin, since she was married, we cannot assume that she is telling the truth.<br>Section two:  The women in this mishnah converted, were freed from slavery or were freed from captivity after the age of three years and one day.  Since it is assumed that in their previous state they had sexual intercourse they cannot claim to be virgins when they grow up and get married.  This is because if a girl has sexual intercourse past the age of three years her physical signs of virginity will not return."}, "19": {"0": "Introduction<br>This sugya deals with the status of an adult woman who had sex with a young man, one not fully capable of having intercourse. In what way is she still considered a virgin?", "1": "According to Rav, an adult woman who had sex with a young boy has the status of a \u201cmukat etz\u201d\u2014literally a woman injured by a stick. This usually refers to a woman who lost her  physical virginity through some way other than sex. If an adult woman who had sex with a young boy is put in this category, then R. Meir would hold that she is still a virgin and her ketubah would be 200 zuz. The other sages would say that she is not a virgin and her ketubah would be 100 zuz.<br>Shmuel holds that the category of \u201cmukat etz\u201d cannot include anyone who had sex. Therefore, since sex with a young boy is not considered intercourse, then she is not even considered a mukat etz. Her ketubah would be 200 zuz, the same as any virgin.", "2": "Oshaia raises an objection against Rav from the Mishnah. Since the sages and R. Meir dispute the status of the girl injured by a piece of wood, but not the status of an adult woman who had intercourse with a small boy, the two categories must be different. Indeed, the fact that they are listed separately means that they are different. The implication is there is no such thing as a \u201cwoman injured by a stick\u201d who actually had sexual intercourse. This accords with Shmuel.", "3": "Rava resolves the difficulty on Rava by rewording the Mishnah. All sages agree that if the girl is young (under three years old) she remains a virgin for her physical signs of virginity grow back (at least the rabbis believe that they do). But when a young boy has had intercourse with an adult woman there is a dispute whether he causes her to lose her virginity. She has the same status as a woman injured by a stick\u2014R. Meir would hold that she is still a virgin and the other sages would say that she is not.", "4": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section relates to the Mishnah where the sages and R. Meir dispute the ketubah of a woman who lost her physical signs of virginity through some means other than sexual relations\u2014the mukat etz. R. Meir holds that she gets a full ketubah of 200, whereas the other sages say she gets only 100.", "5": "The dispute in the Mishnah is only in a case where the man knew that the woman he was marrying had lost her physical virginity. R. Meir says she is a like a \u201cmature girl\u201d\u2014a girl over the age of 12 \u00bd. For whatever reason (I\u2019m really not sure) the rabbis considered any girl over this age to not be a virgin. Nevertheless, there is no doubt whatsoever that she receives a full ketubah. So too, argues R. Meir, does the mukat etz.<br>The Sages say that she is like a woman who had intercourse because she has no physical virginity. Therefore, she receives a ketubah of 100.<br>But, all agree that if the husband did not know beforehand that she was a mukat etz, she does not receive any ketubah at all. Rami bar Hama seems to believe that this is deception, and therefore she loses her entire ketubah.", "6": "The Talmud now explains each of the positions in the Mishnah. R. Meir says that she is like a mature girl because she has never had intercourse. To R. Meir virginity is defined by intercourse with a man.<br>The other sages compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man because in both cases \u201csomething happened.\u201d The rabbis define a virgin as someone who lost her physical virginity through an action of any sort. A mature girl lost her physical virginity without anything whatsoever happening to her. That is why she retains the ketubah of a virgin. But something happened to a mukat etz\u2014therefore she is no longer considered a virgin.", "7": "Nahman objects to Rami bar Hama\u2019s statement from a Mishnah that appears later in the chapter. The Mishnah describes a situation where the husband clearly did not know that she was a mukat etz. If all sages agreed that in such a situation she receives nothing, then what is the point in her saying \u201cI was injured by a piece of wood.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t get anything anyway! The wife\u2019s claim in this Mishnah clearly expresses the notion that she is claiming at least 100 zuz.", "8": "Rava therefore modifies our understanding of the dispute. R. Meir holds that she always gets a ketubah of 200, even if the husband did not know that she was a mukat etz. The other sages say that if the husband knew, she gets 100. If he didn\u2019t know, she loses her ketubah entirely. Note that this means that the Mishnah in which Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate follows R. Meir. The woman is claiming a full ketubah and the husband is claiming that she had had intercourse with a man and therefore should receive a ketubah of 100.", "9": "Introduction<br>The last section of this daf continues the discussion of a man who did not know that his wife was a \u201cmukat etz\u201d\u2014a woman who had lost her virginity in some way other than sexual intercourse. In yesterday\u2019s section Rava stated that according to the sages she loses her entire ketubah. In today\u2019s section the Talmud concludes that he retracted that opinion.", "10": "In order to prove that Rava changed his mind the Talmud cites a sugya that begins with a baraita. The baraita discusses the case of the \u201cmotzi shem ra\u201d\u2014the husband who comes to the court claiming that his wife was not a virgin upon marriage. After correcting the baraita it states two possibilities. First of all, if there are witnesses that she committed adultery after betrothal, then she is an adulteress, and she is to be stoned. This is always the punishment of an adulteress (as well as the man who committed adultery with her). Second, if there are witnesses that she fornicated before she was betrothed to him, she is not an adulteress. She of course does not receive the ketubah of a virgin, but she still receives a ketubah of a maneh (100 zuz).", "11": "Sheshet deduces from this baraita that if a man marries a woman thinking she is a virgin, assuming she told him that she was, and then it turns out that she had sexual relations before betrothal, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. In other words, despite the fact that she deceived him by telling him she was a virgin and that she had never had sex before, she still receives the ketubah she would have received anyway.", "12": "Nahman uses a Mishnah from later in the chapter to refute R. Sheshet. In the Mishnah the husband claims that she had relations with another man before marriage and therefore his acquisition was a mistake. [The woman\u2019s admits that she had sex before the marriage, she just says it was a case of rape and it occurred after the betrothal. Thus she is claiming that she was a virgin at the time of betrothal, and that she lost her virginity against her will]. The simple meaning of this Mishnah is that she receives no ketubah whatsoever. Again, this is a case where he did not know that she was a virgin, but rather than receive a ketubah of a maneh, she receives nothing.", "13": "Sheshet already answered that difficulty in front of R. Amram and the other great sages of his generation. When that Mishnah says that his acquisition was a mistake, it does not mean that she receives no ketubah whatsoever. She receives a ketubah of a maneh. This refutes R. Nahman who claimed that the Mishnah meant she receives nothing.", "14": "Rava now turns the tables yet again and says that the words \u201cmistaken acquisition\u201d imply that she doesn\u2019t receive any ketubah whatsoever. R. Nahman\u2019s difficulty on R. Sheshet was a good difficulty. [Indeed, this does seem to be the simple meaning of the word]. But still, we now have a clash between the Mishnah and the original baraita with which the sugya opened. That baraita had stated that she receives a ketubah of 100.<br>To resolve this difficulty Rava reworks the baraita. He seems to have been justified in doing so because the original baraita was faulty to begin with. So now, instead of two lines, the baraita contains three. First of all, if she had intercourse with another man after betrothal, she is an adulteress who is stoned. This stays the same as above. If it turns out she had sex with another man before betrothal, then she loses her ketubah completely [so now the baraita agrees with the Mishnah]. She should have told him that she had had sexual relations with a man before this marriage.<br>But if it turns out that she was not a physical virgin because she lost her physical signs of virginity in some other way, then she still receives a ketubah of a maneh.", "15": "Now we see why the Talmud concluded that Rava retracted his earlier opinion, where he had stated that if the husband did not know that his wife was a mukat etz, she loses her ketubah entirely, at least according to the rabbis. Here, Rava states that she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. The Talmud believes that this is the later opinion, and that Rava had retracted the earlier statement.", "16": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section is related to the section of the Mishnah that determined whether a woman who had been divorced or widowed from her first marriage but had not yet had sexual relations could still be considered a virgin for a subsequent marriage.", "17": "In this situation, it is quite clear that she did not have relations with her first husband before he died or divorced her. There are witnesses who say they did not. In reality she is still a virgin and she should be considered a virgin for her second marriage. Nevertheless, she is not considered a virgin for her second marriage because she was indeed married the first time. Once her husband brings her into his house for the sake of marriage, she is no longer considered a virgin. Since she is legally not considered a virgin, he can no longer make a virginity claim against her. This is true even if he thought that she was a virgin."}, "20": {"0": "Rabbah deduces from the baraita that if a man marries a woman thinking that she is a virgin, and then it turns out that she is not, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. In this baraita the second husband heard from witnesses that she did not have relations with her first husband. He thinks that she is a virgin. And then when he finds out that she is not a virgin, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. Rabbah thinks that this is true in all scenarios.<br>Ashi says that the baraita describes a special case, one which does not serve as a precedent for all cases. Since this woman had already been married, the second husband cannot expect that she is a virgin. Therefore, this is not a normal case of a woman who is married with the expectation that she is a virgin. In a normal case, she would not receive any ketubah.", "1": "Again the woman in this baraita is married the second time with clear proof that she did not have sexual relations with her first husband. When she turns out not to be a virgin, her ketubah remains a maneh. She doesn\u2019t lose her ketubah. The problem, the Talmud raises, is that she may have had relations with another man after betrothal to the second husband. If she had sex with another man after betrothal, then she should be prohibited to her second husband, as are all adulteresses.<br>The Talmud resolves this problem by saying that the second husband betrothed her and then had relations with her, i.e. married her immediately. In essence this is how we conduct Jewish marriages today\u2014the betrothal and marriage occur one right after the other. And the reason is basically the same. The betrothal period is problematic in Jewish law, for if she has relations with someone else during this period, it is considered adultery.", "2": "This is the exact same sugya as above, but taught in reference to the Mishnah, according to which a \u201cvirgin from marriage\u201d receives a ketubah of a maneh.", "3": "The Talmud now asks what difference it makes whether the dispute between Rabbah and R. Ashi is taught in reference to the baraita or the Mishnah.<br>The difference is that in the baraita there are witnesses who explicitly state that the woman did not have relations with her first husband. Thus someone could teach the amoraic dispute in reference to the Mishnah, where it really is not known for certain whether she had relations with her first husband. It is really only her word. We could say that despite the fact that the husband seems to have believed her, he really should not have. She receives a ketubah of a maneh and he cannot make a virginity claim. R. Ashi could say that this is not a precedent for other cases. But in the case of the baraita, where there are witnesses, the husband really should have been able to cause her to lose the ketubah entirely. R. Ashi could not have stated that this case is different in reference to the baraita.<br>But the one who teaches it in reference to the baraita, where there are witnesses, would all the more so teach it in reference to the Mishnah. R. Ashi would always say that the case is different, despite the presence of witnesses.", "4": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section opens with a new Mishnah. [There are a lot of complicated historical issues related to this Mishnah and the accompanying baraita. If you\u2019re interested, I wrote a paper addressing them. The paper can be found on academia.edu.]", "5": "The usual custom in Mishnaic times was to wait for up to a year between the betrothal and the wedding.  During this time the couple were not supposed to have sexual relations.  Generally speaking, the young woman remained in her parental home during this period and the husband-to-be was elsewhere.  However, our mishnah refers to a practice in Judea, whereby the groom would \u201ceat\u201d at his father-in-law\u2019s house.  This may refer to an extended stay.  If he should do so without witnesses that he was apart from his fiancee, he cannot later claim that she was not a virgin at the time of the wedding.  Once he has been alone with her, we are suspicious that he has had relations with her, and therefore he loses the right to make a virginity claim against her.", "6": "The Talmud notes that not all places in Judea have the custom for the husband to \u201ceat\u201d at his father-in-law\u2019s home before the wedding. Abaye concurs. This implies that in some places in Judea a husband could still make a virginity claim. This will now be confirmed in a baraita that also implies that there are different places with different customs in Judea.", "7": "There are three sections to this baraita, each describing a custom that they had in Judea but not in the Galilee. According to the first custom, the couple would be secluded for a short amount of time before their wedding in order for him to get to know her. \u201cTo become intimate\u201d may mean that they could have had sex, but it is not something of which we could be sure. The point of the custom was for him to get to know her a bit before the wedding.<br>The second custom was for two groomsmen to guard the couple when they enter the bridal chamber (the huppah). The point of this \u201cguarding\u201d is so that they do not deceive each other over matters of virginity. She should not deceive him by bringing in some bird\u2019s blood to fake her virginity. And he should not deceive her by hiding the bloody sheet that would serve as proof of her virginity.<br>We can immediately see that the first custom differs from the second and third customs. The first custom would damage a husband\u2019s ability to make a virginity claim, because he may have jumped the gun. The second two customs were meant to protect his ability to make a successful virginity claim and to defend her against a false claim. This supports Abaye\u2019s claim that there are different customs in Judea.", "8": "The last clause of the baraita stated that a husband who does not observe these customs cannot make a virginity claim. But which of these customs? If it had referred to the first clause, then it should have said, \u201cHe who acted\u201d in this way cannot make a virginity claim.<br>And if it refers to the last clause (really the last two) then it is not really the husband who acts this way. The groomsmen are those acting. The clause would be better had it read \u201che who was not examined\u201d by groomsmen to make sure that he did not falsify the evidence.", "9": "Abaye and R. Ashi emend the Mishnah to read according to one of the two ways suggested above. Only Rava offers a different reading. Basically Rava holds that if a husband keeps the customs of the place where he lives, he can make a virginity claim. The second two customs would serve as guards against the first custom. But only in Judea. A husband who observes the customs of Judea in Galilee would lose his right to make a virginity claim.", "10": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins a new Mishnah.", "11": "A widow receives a ketubah of one maneh (100 zuz) whether she was from an Israelite family or from a priestly family.  However, the court of priests demanded that virgins from priestly families receive double the normal ketubah payment.  We should remember that in this time period priestly families still formed a quasi-elite.  Furthermore, occasionally the mishnah refers to \u201ccourt of priests\u201d.  The priests may have had their own legal system, one which derived from the autonomy they had during Temple times.  Priests tended to live in the same area and intermarriage between priestly families was common.  While the Sages did not protest against the custom of the double ketubah, one can sense that the fact that the mishnah mentions that they didn\u2019t protest, signifies some discomfort with the practice.", "12": "The Talmud opens with a baraita according to which the widow of a priest (who may herself be the daughter of a priest) receives a larger ketubah than an Israelite widow. This baraita directly contradicts the Mishnah.", "13": "Ashi solves the difficulty between the Mishnah and baraita by positing development in the history of the size of the widow of a priest\u2019s ketubah. At first a virgin received 400 and a widow only a maneh. This caused the ratio to be off of the usual 2-1 and men treated the worth of a widow lightly. As a response, the priestly court raised the ketubah of a widow to 200. The problem now was that this amount is the same as that of a virgin Israelite. Men preferred the virgin Israelite and priestly widows were having trouble getting married. Therefore, the court restored the earlier system, even though it too was not perfect.\n"}, "21": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section relates to the Mishnah according to which a higher ketubah was given to a daughter of priests.", "1": "In the Mishnah we learned that the court of the priests would give a 400 zuz ketubah for a daughter of the priests who was a virgin. Shmuel understands the priests as simply being an example of any family with good lineage. He then extends the custom of giving a higher ketubah to anyone who comes from such a family.", "2": "The Talmud cites a baraita as an objection. The baraita states that the higher ketubah may be given even if a priest marries an Israelite or an Israelite marries the daughter of a priest. But from here we could infer that if neither side is of priestly stock, the higher ketubah may not be given.", "3": "The Talmud resolves the difficulty by claiming that the baraita was in the form of a \u201cnot only\u201d baraita. What this means is that the baraita did not even need to state that in a marriage where neither side is a priest, a higher ketubah may be given. This is because neither side can claim to the other, \u201cI am raising you up\u201d because I am marrying lower than my \u201cclass.\u201d Therefore, a higher ketubah can certainly be given. But I might have thought that if one side is raising up the other, that they cannot also demand a higher ketubah. Therefore, the baraita teaches us that it is allowed.<br>I want to add a short explanatory note here. In the Second Temple period being a priest would have usually entailed a high social status. It seems that the priests wanted to express their social status by increasing the minimum level of the ketubah. After the Temple was destroyed, the status of the priests gradually but not entirely, diminished. We can sense this in this sugya\u2014Shmuel is taking some of the customs of the priests and applying them to other families of good lineage.", "4": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section is a Mishnah that begins a series of debates between Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua over the credibility of certain legal claims that a woman might make.  The first debates deals with virginity claims, the main topic of the chapter.", "5": "In the scenario in this mishnah, a man comes to court after the first night with his wife and claims that she was not a virgin.  She responds by admitting that she was not a virgin, but counter-claims that she had lost her virginity by being raped and that the rape had occurred after her betrothal.  Both of these claims are essential to her defense.  The fact that the intercourse took place after betrothal means that she did not deceive him by allowing him to betroth her under the false precept that she was a virgin.  The fact that she had sexual intercourse unwillingly is essential if she wishes not to be considered an adulteress.  If she had intercourse with someone other than her husband after the betrothal she would be an adulteress and as such she would not receive her ketubah.  If the court believes both of her claims, then she would receive her ketubah.  Note that the mishnah uses a metaphor for the woman:  she is a field whose top, fertile layer has been swept away, causing a loss to the man.  The comparison of women to fields or houses, as bothersome as it might be to our modern ears, is not uncommon in rabbinic literature.<br>The husband counterclaims that she had relations before betrothal, and that he acquired her under the mistaken assumption that she was a virgin.  It is unclear whether or not he wishes to pay her a ketubah of 100 or he wishes to be totally exempt from paying her a ketubah.  What is clear is that the dispute in this mishnah is financial:  she wishes to receive her full ketubah and he wishes to lessen his payment.<br>Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer rule that the woman is believed and that she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz.<br>Rabbi Joshua says she is not believed until she can bring proof to back up her words.  In order to extract her ketubah money from him she must prove that she was a virgin at the time of betrothal.<br>The Talmud will explain the underlying legal reasoning behind both of these opinions.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins with an amoraic dispute not connected to the Mishnah.", "7": "The Talmud begins with a dispute over a case where one person (Reuven) approaches another (Shimon) claiming that the latter owes him a maneh (100 zuz). Shimon responds that he doesn\u2019t know if he owes Reuven the money.<br>Huna and R. Judah say that since Reuven is certain that he is owed the money and Shimon is uncertain, Shimon is legally obligated to pay him the money.<br>Nahman and R. Yohanan invoke a different principle\u2014until the case can be determined with 100 per cent certainty, no money changes hands. Since Shimon currently possesses the money, he need not pay Reuven back.", "8": "Abaye now tries to correlate R. Huna and R. Judah\u2019s opinion with that of Shmuel stated in a different context. To understand Shmuel\u2019s statement and how it correlates with R. Huna\u2019s we need to first understand this Mishnah, which will appear later in this chapter. The Mishnah is the last in the series of disputes between R. Gamaliel and R. Joshua (the section with R. Joshua is not quoted here). A woman is found to be pregnant, but claims that the child was the offspring of a priest, a person of valid lineage. Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say that she is believed whereas R. Joshua says that she is not. R. Judah ruled that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.", "9": "Another amora further says to Rav Judah that Shmuel had stated that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel not only in the last Mishnah of his disputes with R. Joshua, it follows him \u201ceven in the first.\u201d<br>The Talmud now correlates the Mishnah with the amoraic dispute above. In the Mishnah, the husband said his wife had sex with another man before betrothal, and the woman says that she was raped after betrothal. The woman\u2019s claim is \u201ccertain\u201d for only she can possibly know what happened to her. Her husband\u2019s claim is \u201cperhaps\u201d\u2014for he doesn\u2019t really know what happened. To Rabban Gamaliel her \u201ccertain\u201d wins out, despite the fact that money will have to change hands\u2014the husband will have to give her the ketubah.<br>Thus saying that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel in the Mishnah is equivalent to saying that Shimon is liable to pay Reuven in the case from above.", "10": "Above, Abaye implied that R. Judah and R. Huna follow Rabban Gamaliel. The Talmud raises the corollary\u2014R. Nahman and R. Yohanan follow R. Joshua.<br>Nahman now claims that he can draw a distinction between the Mishnah and the issue of the disputed maneh. In the Mishnah Rabban Gamaliel believes the woman because she has a \u201cmigo\u201d\u2014which is the Aramaic word for \u201csince.\u201d Here (and in many places throughout the Talmud) it has a technical sense\u2014\u201cSince\u201d the woman could have a made a claim more beneficial to herself, assumedly that she is a mukat etz, she is believed when she makes the worse claim of having been raped after betrothal (such a claim means she can no longer marry a priest). When a person could have made a better claim for herself, she is believed when she makes a worse claim. However, in the case of the disputed maneh there is no possible \u201cmigo\u201d. Reuven already made as good of a claim as he could have made.", "11": "There is an alternative reason why Rabban Gamaliel might say that the woman is believed but not the man who claims the maneh. The last certain status of the woman is that she was a virgin. All women are at some point virgins. Therefore, in a case where we do not know when her status changes, she is considered to be in her \u201cpresumptive state.\u201d But in the case of the maneh, there is no earlier presumptive status.", "12": "The Talmud now concludes by stating that it was necessary for R. Nahman to agree with Rabban Gamaliel. Otherwise we would have a halakhic conflict, for the halakhah always follows R. Nahman in civil matters (the case of the disputed maneh is a civil matter) and in this Mishnah, as we have seen, the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel. In order for these two halakhot not to conflict, R. Nahman must agree with Rabban Gamaliel."}, "22": {"0": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf opens with a new Mishnah, continuing the disputes between the three tannaim over whether a woman is believed when she makes certain claims.", "1": "In this case, when the husband comes to court claiming that his wife was not a virgin, the woman responds that she did not lose her physical signs of virginity through sexual intercourse but rather by \u201cbeing struck by a piece of wood\u201d, meaning she lost her hymen in some other way.  According to Rabbi Meir (whose opinion we learned in an earlier mishnah) if the court believes her, she would receive a full ketubah of 200. According to the Sages she receives a ketubah of 100.  In any case, she is claiming that she does receive some ketubah.<br>The man responds that she lost her virginity by having engaged in sexual intercourse.  The phrase \u201ctrampled by a man\u201d is an illustrative means of saying that she had sex with a man and not that she lost her virginity from a \u201cstick\u201d.  Assumedly his goal is to not pay her any ketubah.<br>Again Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer rule in her favor.  The same reason which applied in the previous Mishnah applies here:  since she is certain and he is uncertain, she is believed.<br>Similarly, Rabbi Joshua holds that she is not believed, and that the money remains with the husband.  Again, the same reason as in the previous Mishnah applies:  in order for her to extract money she must provide proof.", "2": "The question is what is each side in the Mishnah claiming? We have already seen some disputes as to what ketubah a mukat etz receives, so we need to interpret this Mishnah in light of those disputes. Clearly this Mishnah is a case where the husband did not know beforehand that she was a mukat etz. Nevertheless, she is claiming some type of ketubah.<br>Yohanan says that she is asking for a ketubah of two hundred zuz, whereas the husband wants to pay her 100. This follows R. Meir\u2019s opinion that a mukat etz is considered a virgin and receives a ketubah of 200, whether he knew she was a mukat etz or not.<br>Elazar says she is asking for a ketubah of 100, whereas her husband does not want to pay her any ketubah whatsoever. This follows the rabbis who hold that she receives a ketubah of 100, whether he knew she was a mukat etz or not.", "3": "Elazar can answer this in the following way. The first Mishnah is to exclude R. Hiyya b. Abin who held that even if the husband presumed she was a virgin and it turns out she is not, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. That Mishnah taught explicitly that she receives no ketubah, because the husband says, \u201cmy acquisition was a mistake.\u201d The second Mishnah excludes the opinion of Rami b. Hama who held that if the husband did not know she was a mukat etz, she receives no ketubah whatsoever. The fact that she claims she was a mukat etz in this Mishnah obviously means that she is claiming at least 100.<br>That works for R. Elazar. But R. Yohanan agrees with R. Hiyya b. Abin. So why does he need two mishnayot?", "4": "Yohanan would explain the need for two mishnayot based on the legal principle of \u201cmigo\u201d which, as we have seen, means that when one makes a lesser claim despite the possibility of making a better claim, the lesser claim is believed. In the first Mishnah, the woman had a \u201cmigo\u201d\u2014she could have said \u201cI am a mukat etz\u201d instead of saying that, she says she was raped after betrothal. This is a worse claim because it disqualifies her from a marrying a priest. Nevertheless, R. Joshua does not believe her. This Mishnah shows us the strength of R. Joshua\u2019s position; he does not believe her claim even in the presence of a \u201cmigo.\u201d<br>Rabban Gamaliel believes her in the second Mishnah, where she claims \u201cI was a mukat etz\u201d even though in this case she has no \u201cmigo.\u201d She has made the best claim she could possibly make.", "5": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section opens with another Mishnah, with two sections. In both sections, Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer dispute whether the woman is believed. I should emphasize that these mishnayot have nothing to do with virginity claims.", "6": "In the Talmud below there is debate over what the woman was seen doing.  According to some, she was seen having intercourse with an unknown man, and that \u201ctalking\u201d is a euphemism for sex.  Others say that she was merely talking with him, but there was suspicion that they had had sex.  It is important to remember that the situation is that she is a single woman and there is no issue of adultery.  However, if she had had relations with a man who was forbidden from marrying an Israelite, such as a mamzer or a natin, she would subsequently be prohibited from marrying a priest.  When asked who this man was she provides his name and says that he is a priest.  Note that it is not essential that he is a priest; it is sufficient that he is a man who is not prohibited from marrying an Israelite.<br>Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer again rule that the woman is believed and may subsequently marry a priest.  Since she has a presumption of being fit to marry a priest, it requires solid evidence to remove her from this presumption.<br>Rabbi Joshua holds that since she was secluded with him, she loses her presumption of being fit to marry a priest.  She must bring proof that this person was not prohibited from marrying an Israelite and until then she may not marry a priest.", "7": "This section of the mishnah is nearly identical to the section above, the only difference being that this woman is pregnant.  The reason why the mishnah reiterates the positions outlined in the previous mishnah is to teach that Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer believe the woman even if she is pregnant.  In the previous dispute, it was unclear whether or not she had even had sex with the man in question.  When asked who he was, she could have said that she never had relations with him.  Therefore, when she admitted that she did but said that she was a priest (i.e. one who is allowed to marry an Israelite), she is believed.  However, in this section it is certain that she had relations with someone and she could not make a better claim than to say that the man was fit to marry an Israelite. Nevertheless, Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer hold that she is believed.<br>A further innovation is that not only is the woman believed, and she is subsequently allowed to marry a priest, but her child is assumed to be fit to marry an Israelite.  In other words, even though we don\u2019t know for sure that the child is not a mamzer or a natin, the law treats him/her as if he was not.<br>Rabbi Joshua again states that the woman is not believed. Furthermore, her child is assumed to be the child of a natin or a mamzer and may not marry an Israelite until s/he proves otherwise.", "8": "Ze\u2019iri understands the \u201ctalking\u201d in the Mishnah to refer to her being secluded with an unknown man. But according to R. Assi she was seen actually having intercourse. So then why does the Mishnah say that she was seen talking? The answer is that \u201ctalking\u201d can be a euphemism for sex. The Talmud cites another euphemism, this time from the book of Proverbs. This verse refers to an adulterous woman.", "9": "The Talmud now asks why we need two mishnayot that are so similar to each other. For Ze\u2019iri this is not a problem, because he interprets the first Mishnah to refer to a case where she was only secluded. R. Joshua says she is disqualified from marrying a priest even in this case. And Rabban Gamaliel would declare her fit even if she is known to have had sex with another man. So both mishnayot are necessary.<br>Assi cannot use this reason, because he interprets \u201ctalking\u201d to refer to sex. Therefore in both mishnayot it is clear that she had sex with an unknown man. So R. Assi offers another reason for the necessity of two mishnayot. The first declares her to be fit to marry a priest (according to Rabban Gamaliel), and the second, in which she is pregnant, teaches that her child is also fit to marry a priest.", "10": "Below we will see a dispute whether the one who declares the woman herself to be fit, also declares her offspring to be fit. R. Assi, who says that one Mishnah teaches, that she is fit and the other teaches that her offspring is fit, would have to agree with the one who holds that if she is fit, her daughter is fit as well.", "11": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section Ze\u2019iri interpreted \u201ctalking\u201d in the Mishnah to mean \u201cbeing secluded.\u201d The woman in the Mishnah is being accused of being secluded with a strange man. R. Assi interpreted it to mean that she was seen actually having sex. Today\u2019s section continues that discussion.", "12": "Ze\u2019iri\u2019s interpretation of the Mishnah implies that R. Joshua would not allow a woman who had been secluded with an unknown man to subsequent marry a Kohen. This clashes with a statement made by the amora, Rav. Rav said that if a wife is secluded with a man who is not her husband she does receive the punishment of lashes (I know this bothers people, but it probably is just the way the rabbis say that she has transgressed. It does not mean they actually did this). Nevertheless, she is not prohibited from staying with her husband. This means that Rav does not think she actually had sex with the other man. So does Rav contradict R. Joshua, who does not believe her?<br>The resolution is that there is a difference between marrying into the priesthood, the topic of the Mishnah, and remaining married to one\u2019s husband, the topic of Rav\u2019s statement. When it comes to marrying into the priesthood, the rabbis were strict. Even seclusion with a strange man would disqualify her.  But when it comes to remaining with her husband, there needs to be more evidence that she was an adulteress for her to be prohibited.", "13": "This baraita is basically the same as the Mishnah except here instead of her being seen \u201ctalking\u201d with someone, she is seen entering into a hidden place or into a ruin. The Talmud will now explain that this baraita is a difficulty on R. Assi who interpreted \u201ctalking\u201d in the Mishnah to mean that she was seen having intercourse."}, "23": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section brings a baraita to refute R. Assi who had interpreted \u201ctalking\u201d in the Mishnah as the woman being seen having sexual intercourse.", "1": "This is a long baraita which relates to the situation in the Mishnah\u2014a woman is pregnant, but we do not know who the father was. The first opinion, which follows Rabban Gamaliel, says that a woman is believed when she says that the father was a fit person, meaning he had proper lineage. R. Joshua says she is not believed. He argues from the case of a woman who was captured, a topic we will return to later. The assumption is that she was raped by her captors and therefore she is forbidden from subsequently marrying a priest. R. Joshua says that the case of the woman who is pregnant is the same\u2014she is not believed. The rabbis say that the case of the captive woman is different, for there we have witnesses that she was taken captive. R. Joshua responds that her pregnancy is clear testimony that she had sex.<br>The other rabbis now try to draw another distinction between the two cases. The captive woman was taken captive by non-Jews, who we assume are unrestrained in sexual matters. But the woman who is pregnant was not necessarily among a group of non-Jews, and therefore it is more likely that she had relations with someone permitted to her.<br>Finally, the baraita adds an important caveat. She is only believed with regard to herself. But with regard to her offspring, she is not believed. Therefore the offspring must be considered a \u201cshetuki\u201d a child whose father is not known.", "2": "The Talmud now explains some of the dialogue in the baraita. The main thing is that the Talmud adds a shift in topic into the middle of the baraita. At first the rabbis admit to R. Joshua that he successfully responded with regard to the pregnant woman. Such a woman is indeed like a captive woman in that we can be sure she had intercourse. But what about a woman seen \u201ctalking\u201d meaning secluded.<br>Joshua responds that there is no \u201cguardian in sexual matters,\u201d which means that after they have been secluded, we can assume they had sex.", "3": "Assi had interpreted \u201ctalking\u201d as her being seen having intercourse. In his opinion, if she is only seen secluded with an unknown man, R. Joshua would not prohibit her from marrying a priest. But this baraita clearly teaches two different cases, one where she is seen talking and one where she is pregnant. Therefore, R. Assi\u2019s opinion is refuted.

Joshua that when she was taken captive most of the captors would have been men who would disqualify her if they had sex with her (non-Jews).  But when it comes to the pregnant woman, most men would not disqualify her.<br>The fact that the baraita does not mention this difference (at least not explicitly) supports R. Joshua ben Levi who says that it really does not matter whether the majority of men were fit or unfit. R. Joshua says that she is not believed and Rabban Gamaliel says that she is.", "6": " Introduction<br>The Mishnah contained a dispute between Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer whether a woman who was pregnant from a man whose identity is unknown is still fit to marry a priest. Rabban Gamaliel says she is believed to say that the man was a priest (and therefore she is fit) and Rabbi Joshua says she is not believed. Our sugya deals with the status of the offspring.", "7": "Yohanan says that the opinions in the Mishnah concerning the woman herself also apply to her offspring. Rabban Gamaliel would say that just as she is fit, so is her offspring. And of course, Rabbi Joshua disqualifies her offspring, just as he disqualifies her (from marrying a priest).<br>Elazar though makes a distinction, one explained by Rabbah. The mother was born fit to marry a priest. This gives her a presumption, a hazakah, of fitness. In order to remove someone from their hazakah, we need solid proof, which in this case is lacking. However, the child has no such hazakah; from its birth it was not known what its status was. Therefore, even Rabban Gamaliel would admit that the child may not marry a priest (if it is a girl).", "8": "Elazar uses the end of the baraita found in yesterday\u2019s section as a difficulty on R. Yohanan. The baraita seemed to explicitly state that only the woman herself was fit. The offspring is definitely unfit, a shetuki, which means one whose father is unknown.<br>Yohanan resolves this by saying that while the child is a \u201cshetuki,\u201d she is still fit to marry a priest. This is an innovative reading of the word, which the Talmud will now need to explain.", "9": "The Talmud reinterprets the meaning of \u201cshetuki.\u201d A child whose father is not known is not considered a priest, even if we can be sure that his father was a priest. To be a priest one would need to know exactly who one\u2019s father is. But if this child is a girl, she is still fit to marry into the priesthood. In other words, the mother is believed to say that the father was fit. The child too is fit. But there is no way we can consider the child a priest.", "10": "Introduction<br>As often happens the abstract discussion of the halakhah is followed by some actual case law.

Nevertheless, she\u2019s pregnant (it happens now and it happened then). The issue is can we be certain that the child is his. R. Joseph says that since the fianc\u00e9e says it is his, and since the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel who said she is believed, we can certainly believe this particular pregnant woman."}, "24": {"0": "Abaye critiques R. Joseph based on a statement by Shmuel who said that while the halakhah is according Rabban Gamaliel, we should not declare her (or her offspring) fit unless most men were fit for her. This means that most men, who if they had sex with her, would not disqualify her. A betrothed woman is forbidden from having sex with anyone, and the only one who would not disqualify her is her fianc\u00e9e. So, Abaye says, in this case, we should not believe her. ", "1": "The Talmud resolves Abaye\u2019s difficulty by analyzing closely Shmuel\u2019s statement. Shmuel said the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel\u2014she should always be believed. But then Shmuel said that that this halakhah should not be acted on unless the majority are fit for her. The resolution is that ab initio, meaning at the outset, a rabbi should not rule like Rabban Gamaliel unless most men are fit for her. But if the deed already happened, meaning she is already pregnant, ex post facto we can act like Rabban Gamaliel and trust her.", "2": "Introduction<br>In the Mishnah R. Joshua said that a woman is not believed to say that the man she either had relations with or got her pregnant is fit. In today\u2019s section, the Talmud raises a source that seems to contradict this.", "3": "In a Mishnah from Tractate Eduyot R. Joshua says that a widow who had been married to a priest whose lineage was not certain can still subsequently marry a priest. Rashi explains that this priest\u2019s mother may have been a divorcee or may not. If his mother was a divorcee then he is a disqualified priest (a halal). The woman he married would then not be allowed to marry a priest. But since his status is only doubtful, she is allowed to be remarried to a priest.", "4": "Rava now explains the difference between the two situations. In the case of the widow of the man of uncertain lineage, we can assume she would have examined his lineage before marrying him. Lineage was very important in making a marriage decision and a woman would not marry without first ascertaining that the priest she thought she was marrying was really a priest. But in our Mishnah in Ketubot the woman was not marrying, she was having sex with a man not her husband. In such situations, we cannot expect that the woman would check her lineage before having licentious relations with someone. Therefore, R. Joshua would not believe her.", "5": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to discuss the seeming contradiction between the Mishnah in Ketubot and the Mishnah in Eduyot. Whereas yesterday we focused on Rabbi Joshua, today we focus on Rabban Gamaliel.<br>As a reminder, our Mishnah deals with a woman who says that the man with whom she was secluded or had sex was fit to marry her\u2014Rabban Gamaliel believes her, R. Joshua does not.<br>In the Mishnah in Eduyot R. Joshua said that a widow of a priest whose mother is a doubtful divorcee can subsequently marry another priest.", "6": "Rava points out that there is not only a seeming contradiction between R. Joshua\u2019s statements, Rabban Gamaliel also seems to contradict himself. In Ketubot, he believes the woman. In the other Mishnah he says that while in theory he accepts R. Joshua\u2019s testimony, that such a widow may remarry a priest, he also adds in that the halakhah cannot be this way because the priests do not listen to the rabbis to \u201cbring near,\u201d meaning to allow one of doubtful lineage to marry into the priesthood. They only listen to the rabbis in order to distance, to forbid someone from marrying a priest.<br>Rava now offers a new resolution for both Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua. Rabban Gamaliel believes the woman in the case in Ketubot for she is certain that the man she slept with was fit to marry her. But in Eduyot her husband\u2019s lineage is unknown. Therefore, he says we act stringently.<br>Rabbi Joshua did not believe the woman in Ketubot for there is only one doubt\u2014was the man she slept with fit to marry her or not? But in the case in Eduyot there are two doubts. It is not entirely clear what this \u201cdouble doubt\u201d exactly is. Rashi suggests that since the status of his mother was in doubt\u2014was she a divorcee when she married the priest or not\u2014the son\u2019s status is considered a \u201cdouble doubt.\u201d Other commentators say the double doubt refers to a complicated situation where the mother may have been a divorcee and we\u2019re not sure whether the child belonged to the first husband (in which case the child is a valid priest) or to the second husband.

But people don\u2019t have to be concerned that she was married to a \u201cmamzer\u201d or someone with a similar lineage, because people know who the mamzerim are.

By implication, if there is the possibility that the husband comes from mamzerim or natinim (similar to mamzerim in that they are both defective lineage) then the widow may not marry a priest.<br>R.

After all, both are biblical prohibitions. I should note that they are prohibitions in the sense that if they have relations with a woman, they disqualify her from subsequently marrying a priest.", "4": "The second question asks what the differences are between R. Meir\u2019s opinion and the previous anonymous one? Indeed they seem to be exactly the same.", "5": "Here the Talmud detects a self-contradiction within the baraita. R. Shimon (two of them, actually) says that Israelites do not know who the halalim are. This would imply that if a priest may have been a halal, his widow should not be allowed to marry another priest. But the beginning of the baraita had said the exact opposite\u2014that if there may have been a halal, she may not marry into the priesthood.", "6": "Yohanan says that the dispute between the first opinion in the baraita and R. Meir, as well as between R. Shimon and the first opinion is over a person who protests when called a mamzer but is silent when called a halal. The dispute is over how to interpret these responses.<br>According to the first opinion, silence implies agreement with the insult. So if someone is called a halal and does not respond, we can assume that he indeed is a halal.", "7": "Meir says that if someone is silent when called a mamzer or a natin, we can assume that he acquiesces to their silence. No one would be silent in the face of an accusation that would disqualify him from marrying any Israelite. But if someone is called a halal and is silent, he may just not have bothered responding. After all, being a halal is not so bad. He can still marry any Israelite woman. The only consequence would be that his kids would not be able to be priests.", "8": "Shimon b. Elazar then responds to the earlier report of what R. Meir had said. According to this report, R. Meir made fit a person who when called a halal was silent. According to R. Shimon b. Elazar, this is not what R. Meir said. R. Meir actually said the opposite\u2014a person is fit when silent after being called a mamzer, figuring that people will know he is a mamzer. That\u2019s why he does not bother responding.<br>But if he is called a mamzer and protests, then that is a sign that he actually is a mamzer. And if he is called a halal and he is silent, then we have to be concerned that he actually is a halal. He is silent because he thinks that if he protests they will exclude him from the congregation, assuming that he is a mamzer.<br>Thus the real debate is over whether someone who does not protest when called a halal is considered a halal.<br>I should note that R. Yohanan\u2019s resolution is much more than an actual resolution of the baraita. The Talmud conjures up some difficulties that really not are such difficulties in order to facilitate taking a new point into consideration\u2014what does this person say when confronted with the possibility that his lineage is problematic. The baraita itself addressed only the issue of the status of a widow who had been married to a man of doubtful lineage. R. Yohanan brings in an important additional element to the discussion.", "9": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section contains two baraitot dealing with the lineage of a person who when called a halal or a mamzer is silent.", "10": "According to the first baraita, which correlates with the R.

He is silent because he figures the truth will come out. But if he is silent when called a halal, he is unfit. He is only silent because he figures if he opens his mouth, he could make matters worse.<br>But the other baraita holds the opposite, in accordance with the words stated directly by R. Meir in the earlier sections. If he is silent on being called a halal, he is still fit. He is silent because the consequences are not so bad, so he figures why bother responding. But if he is called a mamzer and is silent, he is acquiescing and we can assume that he really is a mamzer.", "11": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section is the last Mishnah of the chapter. It relates to the topic discussed in the previous two mishnayot\u2014if a woman had sexual relations with a man and it is unclear whether that man was permitted to her, can she subsequently marry a priest.<br>As I have stated many times, the Mishnah has a very limited focus. It discusses this subject and not any other aspect of the crime of rape. I realize that this is a sensitive topic in the modern world, but we should keep in mind the scope of the text we are reading.", "12": "The question in this mishnah is can this girl marry into the priesthood.  If the man who raped her was forbidden to marry an Israelite, then she is forbidden to marry a priest. This is true even though she did not willingly engage in intercourse with the man.  Although this sounds like the woman is being punished for having been raped, we would do well to keep in mind that priests were extremely cautious about the \u201cpurity\u201d of their lineage.  The laws of who can and cannot marry a priest have nothing to do with morality, at least not as we understand it.  Rather they have to do with the prohibition of defiling the priestly line.<br>Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri rules that if most of the inhabitants of the town are men who are allowed to marry into the priesthood, meaning that their wives and daughters are allowed to marry priests, then this girl is allowed to marry a priest.", "13": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section relates to the Mishnah from above. It deals with defining the majority necessary such that the girl who was raped by an unknown man remains fit to marry into the priesthood. I should note that the rabbinic determination of when we follow the majority is quite complex and does not really follow what moderns would define as normal statistical probabilities.<br>There are two main issues that the rabbis believe relevant: 1) Were there two groups of people from whom the rapist may have come, such that there would be \u201ctwo majorities\u201d? 2) Was the group stationary or moving? I think in our minds the issue would be simpler\u2014what was the statistical likelihood that the rapist was fit? But the rabbis look at the issue slightly differently.", "14": " Rava wants to analyze this last Mishnah in light of the dispute between R. Joshua and Rabban Gamaliel, neither of whom discussed the issue of the status of the majority of people. R. Joshua declared her unfit, even if the majority of men in the area were fit. And Rabban Gamaliel declared her fit, even if the majority of men in the area were fit.<br>I should note that we could easily solve this difficulty by noting the difference between the situation argued about by Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua and in this Mishnah. They argued about whether the woman should be believed\u2014i.e. she knew the identity of the man she had sex with. R. Yohanan ben Nuri addressed a case of rape\u2014the woman did not know who raped her. In such a situation, she cannot be asked, so we need to use a different criteria to determine whether she is fit.", "15": "A series of amoraim say that the incident referred to in the Mishnah occurred at the time when the wagons would arrive at the marketplaces of Tzippori. As we shall see, this has to do with the issue of the definition of the majority. In this case there are two majorities here\u2014the people of Tzippori and the visiting people."}, "26": {"0": "The Talmud now relates to the opposite case, where we know that the person came from Tzippori and not from a passing group. In such a case the offspring must be considered a \u201cshetuki\u201d a child whose father is unknown and who will not be allowed to marry any Israelite. This follows R. Hanina who said that we follow the majority of the city and not a majority of the people passing through.", "1": "The Talmud believes that we should not follow a stationary majority but we could follow the majority if it is moving. Therefore, the previous statement didn\u2019t really make sense. We should not follow the majority of the city and we should follow the majority of a passing company.<br>The Talmud fixes this problem by emending R. Hanina\u2019s statement. We follow the majority of the town only when the majority of the passing company is also fit to marry into the priesthood. But we do not follow a single majority in any case\u2014either the inhabitants of the town or the members of a passing company.<br>Theoretically, we could follow the simple majority of the passing company because when the group is moving, one majority should be necessary. But we do not follow this majority lest we come to follow the majority of the inhabitants of the town. This would be problematic because they are stationary and a stationary majority is not followed.", "2": "Finally, the Talmud adds in that if the rapist had left the city, we would follow the majority of the city. This follows a general rule that anyone who separates from a group is considered to have come from the majority.<br>The only time we therefore need two majorities is where she went to the city. R. Zera said that if the group is stationary, we do not follow a single majority. Rather, we look at it as if half the city was fit and half unfit, in which case we would have to rule strictly. But if there was also another majority of men who were fit, she would be considered fit.<br>Let me try to summarize some of these rules:<br>If the group of potential rapists is moving\u2014we follow a majority.<br>If the group is stationary, but the potential rapist left the group, we follow the majority.<br>If the group is stationary, and she went to the group, we do not follow the majority.<br>If there are two potential groups both of whom have a majority of fit men, then she is allowed to marry into the priesthood.", "3": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we said that in order for the girl who was raped by an unknown man to be fit to marry a priest, there must be two majorities of fit men\u2014the men of the town and the men of a passing company.

If 90 per cent of the stores in town sell kosher meat (ritually slaughtered) and one store sells non-kosher meat, and a person does not remember which store he bought from, we do not follow the majority and the meat is prohibited. This is the case of a stationary majority where the person went to the majority. All of the meat was stationary and therefore we look at it as if there was no majority. But if a piece of meat was found elsewhere and we do not know what store it came from, then we do follow the majority, even though there is only one majority.", "5": "We cannot solve the difficulty by saying there were also groups of people passing through the city such that we would have two majorities.

Zera said that we follow a majority even when the gates of the city are closed such that there could only be one majority.", "6": "The resolution distinguishes between the case of the girl in Tzippori and the case of the meat.

Before we analyze this, I should note a few relevant halakhot with regard to damages.<br>If a Jew damages the property of a non-Jew, the Jew is not liable [I know, this is discriminatory]. If a non-Jew damages the property of a Jew, he is always liable for full damages, even if had a Jew done the damage, the Jew would have been liable for only half-damages.<br>To return to our particular case: If an ox that belonged to a Jew gored an ox belonging to this foundling from a city that is half Jewish, the Jew could say to him, \u201cProve that you\u2019re a Jew and then I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d Since the owner of the damaged party cannot prove that he is a Jew, the damager need not pay. So in this case, we cannot say he is being considered a Jew.<br>So it must be the opposite case\u2014an ox owned by this child gored an ox owned by a Jew. The person from the town half of whose inhabitants are Jewish and half not, must pay the Jew half the damages, as if he was a Jew. But he can say that he won\u2019t pay the other half until the Jew proves that he is non-Jewish. Since the Jew cannot prove this, we must assume that the child (now grown-up) is Jewish and he needs to pay only half of the damages. ", "8": "Congratulations\u2014You finished the first chapter of Ketubot. You should know, that despite the fact that some of these topics seem obscure, this is one of the most well-learned chapters in the entire Talmud. Indeed, the chapter itself is sometimes called \u201cShas Katan\u201d\u2014the little Talmud\u2014because it contains so many principles that are necessary and useful in understanding the rest of the Talmud.", "9": "Introduction<br>The chapter opens with a Mishnah which discusses a dispute between a husband and wife over whether the woman was a virgin or a widow when he married her.  Evidently, the written ketubah from their marriage is not available as evidence (perhaps it was never written).  Therefore this is again a question of whether or not the woman is believed.<br>We can further learn from this mishnah that the woman may collect her ketubah payment even if she does not have the document.  This is because the ketubah payment is a court-imposed obligation upon every husband.  The loss of the ketubah document does not mean that the woman will not be able to collect her ketubah payment.", "10": "In this mishnah the husband and wife come before the court at the time of their divorce.  The woman claims that she was a virgin when her husband married her, while he claims that she was a widow.  The mishnah rules that we check the evidence, and if there is evidence that her wedding was a virgin\u2019s wedding, then she receives her full ketubah. In the absence of hard evidence, she can only receive a ketubah of 100 zuz.<br>There are three pieces of evidence described in our mishnah.  The first is the \u201chinuma\u201d.  It is uncertain what this word exactly means, and several explanations have been offered.  Albeck explains the word as being a \u201chymn\u201d sung at virgin\u2019s weddings.  Based on the Talmud\u2019s explanation, Kehati explains a \u201chinuma\u201d to be a special veil worn only by virgins.<br>The second piece of evidence is that her hair hung down to her shoulders.  This is the manner in which women wore their hair during the procession that led them away from their father\u2019s house.<br>The third sign, mentioned by Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka is parched corn, which were distributed at virgin\u2019s weddings.<br>We should explain why in this mishnah the woman is not believed and therefore needs to bring evidence that she was a virgin, whereas in the mishnayoth at the end of the last chapter, Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer believed the woman without any corroborating evidence.  The answer is that in this case both the man and woman can claim to be certain of the facts.  He is just as certain that he married a widow as she is certain that she was a virgin.  Therefore neither is believed more than the other.  Since the woman wishes to extract money from the man, the burden of proof is upon her, as is the rule in all monetary claims.", "11": "At the end of the last chapter there was a series of debates in which Rabbi Joshua consistently did not believe the woman and Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer did.  Our mishnah contains a case where Rabbi Joshua does believe the claim made (this time by a man).  The reason why he believes the man in this case is that he invokes a principle called, \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted\u201d.  This halakhic principle means that if a person says something which makes something forbidden to him he is also believed when he says something to make that very same thing permitted to him.  This Mishnah, and the few that will follow it (later in the Talmud) will illustrate this principle and limit its applicability.<br>Section one: In this case Reuven approaches Shimon and tells him that the field that is currently in Reuven\u2019s possession was purchased from Shimon\u2019s father.  Shimon did not approach Reuven first claiming the field, nor is there any other evidence that the field once belonged to Shimon\u2019s father.  Indeed, without Reuven having told Shimon that the field once belonged to Shimon\u2019s father, we would have thought that the field was always Reuven\u2019s.  In this case Reuven is the \u201cmouth that forbade\u201d when he said that the field once belonged to Shimon\u2019s father.  He made a statement that was detrimental to himself.  Since he is the \u201cmouth that forbade\u201d, he is believed to be the \u201cmouth that permits\u201d and state that he purchased the field from Shimon\u2019s father.  Reuven is believed even if he produces no evidence that he bought the field.  Had Reuven kept his mouth shut, Shimon would never have known that the field once belonged to his father.  Therefore, Reuven is believed when he says that it used to belong to Shimon\u2019s father but he bought it from him.<br>Section two:  In contrast, if witnesses come and state that the field was once Shimon\u2019s father\u2019s field, then Reuven is not \u201cthe mouth that forbade\u201d.  He is only the \u201cmouth that permits\u201d, and he is therefore not believed.  After all, had he kept his mouth shut, the field would have been taken over by Shimon.  In order to retain possession of the field he will need to bring proof that he bought it."}, "28": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins to discuss the Mishnah.", "1": "The Mishnah says that if there are witnesses that she was married with the customs of a virgin, then she is believed and she receives a ketubah of 200. The implication is that in the absence of witnesses, the husband is believed and her ketubah would be that of a widow. This would mean that this anonymous mishnah accords with Rabbi Joshua and not Rabban Gamaliel.", "2": "This mishnah could accord even with Rabban Gamaliel (who always believed the woman in last week\u2019s cases), for in this case both she and her husband are certain in their claims. He is certain that she did not wear the veil worn by virgins and she is certain that she did. Therefore, in this case, the woman does not win. In contrast, in the other mishnayot, she was certain, either that she was a mukat etz, or that she was raped after betrothal. In contrast, the husband is not certain that she lost her virginity through premarital intercourse. He can only be certain that he believes that she is not a virgin. That is why she is believed.", "3": "The Talmud now asks why we ever questioned the relationship between this mishnah and that in the previous chapters. Obviously the case in this chapter is where both parties are certain. The answer is that we might have thought that since most women are virgins at their wedding (meaning most marriages are first marriages) she is certain and he is not certain. Therefore, this mishnah teaches that she is not believed, even according to Rabban Gamaliel.", "4": "The Talmud now proves that Rabban Gamaliel agrees that in the case in this chapter\u2019s Mishnah the woman is not believed. The Mishnah says \u201cand Rabbi Joshua agrees\u201d implying that just as Rabbi Joshua agrees in the second clause of this Mishnah (concerning the person who says, \u201cThis field was your fathers, but I bought it from him,\u201d Rabban Gamaliel agrees with Rabbi Joshua in the first clause.<br>However, this too is rejected. Rabbi Joshua may be agreeing with a principle that Rabban Gamaliel said in the previous chapter. This principle is called \u201cmiggo.\u201d I have explained it above, but I will do so again here. It means that if someone makes a claim that is not the best claim they could have made, they are believed. The Talmud will delve into this in depth below. So stay tuned!", "5": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned that Rabbi Joshua\u2019s statement in the second half of the first Mishnah of this chapter refers to a disagreement he had over a \u201cmiggo\u201d in the first chapter. Again, a miggo is a case where a person made a certain legal claim but could have made a better claim. Generally in such cases, the person is believed. The logic is that if they wanted to lie, they would have made up a better lie. Therefore, they are assumed to be telling the truth. The Talmud now tries to find out what this refers to. Where is there a \u201cmiggo\u201d that Rabbi Joshua disagrees with?", "6": "In the case in this Mishnah, the woman made the best possible claim she could have made\u2014the child is the offspring of a priest. Therefore, there is no \u201cmiggo.\u201d So this cannot be the \u201cmiggo\u201d with which Rabbi Joshua disagrees.", "7": "According to Zeiri\u2019s interpretation of this Mishnah, there would be a \u201cmiggo.\u201d The woman is accused of being \u201csecluded\u201d with a man and she responds by admitting that she did have intercourse with him, but that he was a \u201ckosher\u201d guy\u2014meaning sex with him would not disqualify her from subsequently marrying a priest. Had she wanted to make up a better claim, she could have said that she didn\u2019t have sex at all. Therefore, when she admits she had sex, she is believed.<br>But R. Assi interprets the phrase in the Mishnah, \u201cshe was talking\u201d to mean that she is accused of having sex. So she could not have made any better claim. Therefore there is no \u201cmiggo.\u201d", "8": "In this Mishnah the wife says that she was a \u201cmukat etz,\u201d meaning she lost her virginity through some way other than sex, and her husband says that she lost her virginity through sex.<br>According to R. Eliezer she is claiming a ketubah of 100 and her husband wants to give her nothing. She could have made a better claim\u2014she could have said that she was a virgin at betrothal and then became \u201cinjured by a stick\u201d after betrothal. If this were true, she would get a ketubah of 200. Therefore, she has a miggo and is believed when she says that she was injured by a stick before betrothal.<br>But according to R. Yohanan, she is claiming a ketubah of 200, the highest level of ketubah she could possibly get. So what possible miggo could there be? ", "9": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues the search for the \u201cmiggo\u201d which R. Joshua disagrees with. To put this another way, in what case mentioned in the mishnayot of the first chapter does the woman make a claim that was not the strongest claim she could have made.", "10": "Finally the Talmud locates a case where the woman could indeed have made a better claim. The woman in this Mishnah responds to her husband\u2019s claim that she was not a virgin by claiming that she was raped after betrothal. She will indeed receive the whole ketubah (if believed) but by claiming that she was raped after betrothal, she disqualifies herself from subsequently marrying a priest. [A woman who had sex with a man prohibited to her is forbidden from marrying a priest, even if that sex was not of her own choice.] She could have made a better claim here\u2014she could have said that she was injured by a piece of wood after betrothal. With such a claim she would receive the full ketubah, and be allowed to marry a priest. Since she makes a worse claim, Rabban Gamaliel believes the worse claim that she actually makes.", "11": "Joshua now says to Rabban Gamaliel that he believes the man who says, \u201cThis field belonged to your father but I bought it from him,\u201d because he has a miggo (to be explained below). But in the case in the previous chapter, despite the existence of a miggo, R. Joshua does not believe the woman. ", "12": "The Talmud now asks the obvious question\u2014since R. Joshua accepts the principle of miggo, why does he believe the man who says, \u201cThis field was your fathers, but I bought it from you\u201d but not the woman who says, \u201cI was raped after betrothal\u201d?<br>The answer is that there is some evidence that she was not a virgin in the case regarding the woman. This is the \u201cslaughtered ox\u201d\u2014i.e. evidence. But in the case in this chapter\u2019s Mishnah, there is no evidence whatsoever as to whom the field belonged. The only evidence is the man\u2019s words. He could have said, \u201cThis field was always mine\u201d and we would never have known any different. Therefore, R. Joshua believes him when he says he bought it from the other person\u2019s father.", "13": "The Mishnah had stated that only if witnesses come to testify that she was married as a virgin does she receive a full ketubah. However, we also said earlier that the fact that most women are virgins at marriage might have turned the husband\u2019s claim into \u201cuncertain.\u201d The Talmud picks up on that point and says that if most women are married as virgins, shouldn\u2019t we just assume that she was a virgin as well. Why not believe her?<br>The answer is that had she been a virgin, people would have known about it. A first time wedding is a big deal\u2014it has a \u201cvoice\u201d\u2014people will talk about it. Since there does not seem to be clear communal knowledge that this woman was a virgin at her marriage, she loses the assumption that she is part of the majority."}, "29": {"0": "The Talmud now goes in the other direction. If people generally know when a woman is getting married for the first time, and no one is saying that this woman was married for the first time, then we should assume that she was not being married for the first time. The witnesses who come and say that this was her first marriage must be lying.<br>Ravina therefore emends his statement from above. It is not always known that a woman being married is being married for the first time. It is just a case of \u201cmost.\u201d Most of the time people will know that a woman is being married for the first time. But some of the time they will not. And since witnesses come and testify that this was her first marriage, we can assume that she was not part of the majority. She must have been the rare case of a woman who was married as a virgin but people did not know about it.", "1": "Introduction<br>The Mishnah had stated that if there were witnesses that she had worn the virgin\u2019s veil at her wedding or witnesses to any other sign of this having been her first marriage, she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz. In other words, she basically collects her ketubah payment without producing the written document. The Talmud asks how we can be sure that she cannot collect her ketubah twice, once on the basis of witnesses and then a second time using the document itself.", "2": "The Talmud offers two solutions to the problem I mentioned above. First of all, they could write a receipt for the husband when he pays out his ketubah. This way he will not have to pay twice. Second, the Mishnah could refer to a place where they do not write out ketubot, probably due to a lack of scribes. In such a place, there is no fear that she will be able to collect with a written document, for there is no such document.", "3": "The Talmud now teaches the same traditions of R. Abbahu and Rav Papa but in reference to a different baraita. First the baraita mentions the possibility that there was a ketubah, but for some reason it has been misplaced. Next the baraita provides additional signs that the wedding was that of a virgin. If there are witnesses either to the ketubah or to the performance of one of these actions, then she is considered to have been wedded as a virgin.", "4": "The problem now is how can Rav Papa say that this baraita refers to a place where they do not write the ketubah! First of all, the baraita says that \u201cshe lost her ketubah.\u201d This, the Talmud explains, might mean that although they don\u2019t normally write ketubot in this place, in this particular case the husband happened to have written her a ketubah.<br>The problem then goes back to the same issue we had in the first place\u2014if he wrote her a ketubah, what\u2019s stopping her from collecting twice, once with witnesses and once with the document?", "5": "As an answer, the Talmud interprets \u201cshe lost it\u201d to mean \u201cshe lost it in the fire.\u201d<br>But this too is problematic. First of all, now the baraita is repetitive. Second, we would still have the problem if she hid it\u2014she could take it out and collect twice. Third, if the baraita meant to teach that she lost it in the fire, why say that she lost it [this difficulty seems to really just be a repetition of the first one].", "6": "To answer all of these difficulties the Talmud rephrases the baraita. If she lost her ketubah she must prove that it was burned. Until she does so, she does not collect any ketubah, for fear that she will collect twice.", "7": "The sugya concludes, as these types of sugyot often do, by noting that the one who taught the amoraic statements of R. Abbahu and Rav Papa in reference to the baraita, would also teach these statements in reference to the Mishnah, where it is easier to apply them (mostly Rav Papa\u2019s statement). But those who teach them in reference to the Mishnah would not teach them in reference to the baraita due to the difficulty of Rav Papa saying that the baraita refers to a place where they do not write ketubot, when the baraita explicitly mentions the writing of a ketubah.", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to interpret the mishnah from the beginning of the chapter.", "9": "Just as in yesterday\u2019s section we had a fear that she would collect based on witnesses and then try to collect again based on the same evidence using other witnesses. So how do we prevent this?<br>The answer is that if there is no other way of preventing this, then they have to write out a receipt.", "10": "The Talmud now explains the symbolic meaning of the cup of wine passed before her at the wedding. The first explanation is that it is a cup of terumah wine. Terumah can only be consumed by a priest. So by passing terumah wine in front of her, we are symbolically saying that she was fit to be married by a priest.<br>The problem is that while a divorcee will not be able to eat terumah if she is marrying a priest, a widow could. So how can this cup be a sign of her being a virgin, when a widow can have terumah?<br>Rav Papa therefore applies a different symbolic meaning to the cup. Terumah is called \u201cfirst\u201d and it is this woman\u2019s first marriage. So the terumah is symbolic of her.", "11": "In a baraita, R. Judah mentions a slightly different practice performed at the weddings of virgins\u2014they would pass a barrel of wine in front of them. Rav Adda son of Ahava clarifies this practice. They would pass a closed barrel in front of virgins and an open one in front of women who had already had intercourse.<br>This practice is obviously insulting to the non-virgin. Why not just pass the barrel in front of the virgin and do nothing in front of the non-virgin.<br>The answer is that sometimes positive testimony that she was married not as a virgin is required. If she seizes 200 zuz, the ketubah amount for a virgin, then if the practice was not to pass a barrel at all in front of a non-virgin, she could claim that they just did not have access to a barrel of wine. Therefore, they instituted the practice to pass an open barrel in front of a non-virgin so that everyone would know she is not a virgin. [I think it is significant that the Talmud notes that it is insulting to pass an open barrel in front of the non-virgin].", "12": "This is a famous debate between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel\u2014should one be honest with a bride about her appearance or should every bride be praised? Bet Hillel holds that despite the untruth, one should always strive to make others feel good, praising them and the things that they have bought. There is no reason whatsoever to tell a bride that she is not beautiful."}, "30": {"0": "Introduction<br>This section continues to cite traditions about songs and dances at weddings.", "1": "What is most fascinating to me about this source is the equation it draws between a bride on her wedding day and the rabbi receiving ordination. Both are described as graceful or beautiful gazelles, despite the fact that they do not wear any makeup or beautify themselves. The image of the physical and feminine beauty of the Torah scholar is common in rabbinic literature and probably represents a rejection of the normal masculine image.", "2": "The meaning of some of the words I have translated is not particularly clear, but the general sense of the tradition is. When these two rabbis were ordained, this is the song that they sang to them.", "3": "The Talmud is basically collecting stories of sayings stated in front of Rabbis concerning their beauty or related attributes. This one is simply when R. Abbahu would come to the Emperor\u2019s court.", "4": "These are more traditions concerning dancing in front of a bride before her wedding. To this day, in traditional circles it is customary for the rabbi to dance in front of the bride.", "5": "This last story explores what might be the problem with some of this behavior\u2014does it border on sexual impropriety. Rav Aha would actually put the bride on his shoulders and dance around with her. He warns his students that if they want to do this too, they must make sure that she is \u201clike a beam,\u201d meaning there are no sexual aspects to the act, then it is okay. But if they cannot help having sexual thoughts with the beautiful bride on their back, then they should refrain.", "6": "Again, this source alludes to the overt sexuality at a wedding. Men at the wedding may look at a bride, for by their being sexually attracted to her, her husband\u2019s desire for her will grow. However, the halakhah does not follow this tradition. According to this opinion, while there may be some positive benefits to engendering desire for the bride, the act is simply too fraught with danger.", "7": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to discuss various aspects of the bridal procession.", "8": "These kind of halakhot are how the rabbis express their value system. The value of a wedding is greater than the value of a funeral procession. While I doubt that such a conflict would in reality occur all that frequently, the rabbis say that the needs of the wedding take precedence.<br>Finally, royalty and the honor and fear due to royalty take precedence over both. However, the story of Aggripa, who was king over Israel during the Second Temple period, seems to contradict this point\u2014Aggripa forgoes his honor and allows the bridal procession to pass by in front of him. For his willingness to forgo his honor, the sages praise him.", "9": "The Talmud now detects a problem with Aggripa\u2019s behavior\u2014kings are not supposed to forgo their own honor. We might think of this as respecting the office even if the person holding that office does not feel the need to be respected. So Aggripa should not have allowed the bridal procession to go in front of him.<br>The resolution is that they were at a crossroads, such that it would not have looked to everyone as if he was letting the procession go in front of him. But had they not been at the crossroads, it would have been forbidden for Aggripa to allow the bridal procession to pass him.", "10": "In this baraita we again see a hierarchy of values, but a complicated one. In the rabbinic mindset, few things rank higher than the study of Torah. But there are a few exceptions. To a certain extent, the needs of a bride and the burial of the dead take precedent over Torah study. But this is only true in a collective sense\u2014the Torah studying community must ensure that the needs of the dead are taken care of. But, if there are already enough people at the funeral procession, the Torah scholar should continue to study Torah.", "11": "Above, we said that if there are enough people for the funeral procession, then one does not interrupt Torah study. But what is enough? The simple sense sounds to me like a normal amount of people for a funeral, whatever that might have been. But the answers given are extremely large. It sounds to me like what these rabbis are basically saying is that there is no such thing as \u201cenough\u201d people at a funeral procession.<br>At the conclusion of this passage, the soul is compared with the giving of the Torah\u2014just as the Torah was given in front of 600,000 people, so too the soul, the inner Torah, should be taken away in the presence of 600,000 people. This is a beautiful image\u2014our neshamot, our inner spirits and life force, are our own personal Torah."}, "31": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s short section defines the unusual word \u201chinuma\u201d which I translated as a veil. This \u201chinuma\u201d was the sign of her being a virgin.", "1": "There are two definitions of the hinuma. The first is that it refers to the way the huppah itself was made. The second is that it refers to the veil. Since she sometimes falls asleep behind the veil. It is called \u201cthe veil under which the bride naps.\u201d", "2": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to explain the Mishnah.", "3": "In the Mishnah R. Yohanan ben Beroka said that the passing out of parched grain is the sign of the wedding of a virgin. But that is the sign of proof only in Judea. This is not a universal custom (what is?).<br>In Babylonia, evidently they would pour oil on heads of the rabbis at the wedding of a virgin.", "4": "The dialogue here illustrates that not everyone knew of this custom. Evidently, R. Papa was puzzled by it. Abaye rebukes him, even making a not particularly nice reference to his mother!<br>The Talmud then illustrates this with an actual story of this as it occurred at the wedding of a rabbi\u2019s son.", "5": "One might have thought that there might be a positive sign at the wedding of a widow, something to let everyone know that a widow was being married. But according to R. Joseph there is not. The sign that a widow is being married is simply the absence of the sign of a virgin being married\u2014the distribution of roasted ears of grain.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins to deal with the case in which R. Joshua agrees\u2014if a person says to his fellow, this field belonged to your father and I bought it from him, he is believed.", "7": "Joshua in the Mishnah illustrates the \u201cmigo\u201d [a claim made when a better claim could have been made] with the case of a person who says \u201cI bought this field from your father.\u201d But why use this example when he could have stated a simpler case, \u201cI bought this field from you.\u201d<br>The answer has to do with the second clause. If the first clause is a case of \u201cI bought this field from you\u201d and he is believed, then the second clause would have had to have been \u201cI bought this field from you\u201d and there are witnesses that it belonged to the other person. In such a case, since there are witnesses, the claimant has no \u201cmigo\u201d\u2014he could not have made a better claim. Therefore, he is not believed. Below we shall see the problem with this, had this been the case illustrated in the Mishnah.", "8": "To understand this section I must explain the concept of hazakah. Hazakah means presumption or assumption. If a person uses a field, meaning eats its produce or shows that he owns it in some other way, for three years, he is assumed to own the field, even if the other person holds the deed. The idea is if the person holding the deed wanted to protest that another was using his field, he should have done so during those three years. The fact that he did not, means that he must have sold it to the person using it.<br>So the problem in our Mishnah is why should his claim matter\u2014all that should matter is whether he demonstrated ownership by eating the produce of the field.", "9": "The problem is that even if the case involves the father\u2014\u201cI bought it from your father\u201d\u2014whether he is believed or not should hinge on whether he used it for three years and established \u201chazakah,\u201d a presumption of ownership. Why does the Mishnah say that the claimant\u2019s believability depends on the presence of witnesses who say that it once belonged to the other person\u2019s father?<br>The case in the Mishnah could work vis a vis the father, if the claimant used the field for two years while the father was alive and then one year after his death. These three years of use do not establish \u201chazakah\u201d a presumption of ownership, because, as Rav Huna teaches, there needs to be three years of acting as owner in front of one person. Think of it this way\u2014if the person used the field for two years while the father was still alive, the father may have intended to protest during the third year, as is his right. When the father died, the son should have three full years to protest as well. Thus hazakah is not a factor in this case.<br>If this is the case, then the Mishnah works. If the only way we know that the field belonged to the other party\u2019s father is through the claimant\u2019s words, then he (the claimant) is believed. This is a case of \u201cthe mouth that prohibits is the same mouth that permits.\u201d But if there is external evidence that the field belonged to the father, then the claimant must produce evidence to be believed.", "10": "The Talmud now raises the problem that R. Huna seems to be teaching us what is already in the Mishnah. Why should he teach us something that we could have already derived from there? There are two answers to this [somewhat insignificant] difficulty. 1) He makes explicit what was only implicit in the Mishnah. 2) He adds the case where the son had already become of age. We might have thought that in this case, it would be sufficient for the person to use the field for two years in front of the father and one year in front of the son. Therefore, R. Huna teaches that it is not.", "11": "Introduction<br>This section continues yesterday\u2019s discussion. There we learned that in order to establish hazakah, presumption of ownership, the possessor must use the land for three years in front of one person. If the person used the field for two years while the father was alive and one year while his son was alive, this is not sufficient.", "12": "The Talmud still tries to find a case that does not involve the father and yet there is no hazakah. Such a case could be one where the possessor used the field for two years in front of the previous owner and then the owner ran away. Since he was not present to protest for three consecutive years, there is no hazakah. However, now the Talmud will examine what the specific case was.", "13": "If the person fled due to danger to his life, he [the claimant] is obviously not believed. The original owner could not have protested because he was running away to save his life.", "14": "The Talmud now proves that if the original owner fled for financial reasons, he should have protested, even if he was not in close proximity. This is learned from a Mishnah. The Mishnah divides Palestine into three regions for matters of hazakah. For the possessor to establish hazakah, the original owner must be in the same region. The Talmud will now use this to prove that one can protest even if he is not in the presence of the possessor.", "15": "The Talmud refers to a discussion that occurred elsewhere concerning this Mishnah\u2014can the original owner protest in the absence of the possessor? If he can, then why should he not be able to do so when they are in different regions? And then when he doesn\u2019t protest, the hazakah should be valid. In other words, the fact that he can protest makes hazakah possible. And if he cannot protest when not in front of the possessor, then why should he be able to do so when they are in the same region, but not together?", "16": "Abba bar Mamel says that according to the Mishnah one may protest in the absence of the possessor. The Mishnah says there is no hazakah when they are in different regions because they are so far apart that the possessor might not hear the original owner\u2019s protest. If he doesn\u2019t hear it, then he may not bother holding on to the document that he used to purchase the land from him. Since the protest cannot work, there can be no establishment of hazakah through possession. In other words, establishing hazakah works only when the original owner could protest and does not. If he could not protest effectively, then there is no such thing as hazakah.<br>It always dangerous to travel from Judea to the Galilee. Therefore, these two lands were mentioned, but the same would be true for any two lands between which it is dangerous to travel."}, "32": {"0": "Introduction<br>This section returns to asking the same question that was asked early on the previous page. Why does R. Joshua illustrate his law by citing the case of one who says, \u201cThis field belonged to your father and I bought it from him.\u201d Why not use a different case?", "1": "This case would seem to be a proper illustration of a migo\u2014the person could have kept his mouth shut and no one would have known that he had borrowed a maneh from his friend. He is the mouth that prohibited (i.e. admitted that he owed money) and he is the mouth that permitted (said that he paid him back). So why not use this case?", "2": "The problem with the above way of teaching the Mishnah would be that the last clause would have to read that if there are witnesses that he borrowed a maneh, then he is not believed to say he paid it back. This is not true\u2014a person is believed to say he paid back a debt, at least from Torah law.", "3": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section contains another suggestion as to what the Mishnah could have taught instead of the case of \u201cThis field was your father\u2019s and I bought it from him.\u201d", "4": "In this case, the person admitting that he had borrowed money claims to have paid back half. This would seem to be another cogent case of a migo\u2014had he wanted he could have said he paid the whole thing back and no one would have known the difference.", "5": "The problem with using the example of returning half of a debt is that it brings us into the case of the one who admits to owing a partial debt. In this case, R. Eliezer b. Yaakov says that he must take an oath that he doesn\u2019t owe the rest of the money. Our Mishnah in Ketubot does not mention an oath, and therefore this case could not have been used according to this view. The other rabbis hold that a person who admits to owing half a debt is like one who returns a lost object. He is believed not because of any migo (he could have made a greater claim) but because we do not force people who are returning lost objects to take oaths that they are returning the entire amount. Even if the claimant asked for his father\u2019s debt to be returned, the person would be believed to say that he already returned half because he is like someone returning a lost object.", "6": "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday\u2019s section there was an implication that according to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, when one returns a lost object, he may have to take an oath that he has returned the entire amount. The specific case had been a person who says, \u201cI owed your father a maneh and now I am returning half.\u201d The Talmud now questions whether R. Eliezer b. Yaakov indeed holds such a position.", "7": "Rav answers the difficulty by saying that the person must take an oath that he already paid back half of the debt when a minor (we\u2019ll call him Shimon) claimed that the person (Reuven) owed his father the debt. This is not really a case of \u201creturning a lost object\u201d because there was a claim of debt before Reuven announced that he had paid back half to Shimon\u2019s father. In other cases, if someone is simply returning a lost object without someone making a claim against him, he would not have to take an oath that he was returning the whole amount.", "8": "The problem with the above interpretation is that in general one does not have to take an oath in response to a claim put against him by a deaf-mute, person lacking sound senses or a minor, because we cannot have a high level of certainty concerning the veracity of these persons\u2019 claims. So when the son claims that another person owed his deceased father money, the person being claimed against should not have to take an oath.<br>For this reason, the Talmud reinterprets \u201cminor\u201d to mean \u201cson of\u2026.\u201d He is not really a minor, he is just regarded as a minor vis a vis the affairs of his father.", "9": "We\u2019re still not out of the woods yet. The baraita in yesterday\u2019s section said that \u201csometimes a person must take an oath on his own statement.\u201d The way we are now explaining this baraita is not that the Reuven initiated the statement by saying, \u201cI owed your father money but I paid half.\u201d Rather, Shimon, the son of the deceased father, initiated the claim.<br>This problem is not solved, forcing the Talmud to now offer another explanation for this baraita.", "10": "The concept explained here is called \u201cthe one who admits to owing part of a debt.\u201d The idea is that if Shimon claims that Reuven owes him money, and Reuven admits to owing part of the debt, the Torah imposes an oath on him to verify his admission. The psychology of this halakhah is interesting. Reuven would not be so brazen as to deny an entire debt. Telling such a big lie directly to a person from whom one has borrowed money is just too much. But if Reuven does not have the money to pay back the full debt, he may allow himself a smaller lie\u2014I only owe you half the money. To prevent people from denying half the debt, the Torah imposes an oath on Reuven in such a case."}, "33": {"0": "The Talmud now plugs the debate about the applicability of Rabbah\u2019s statement back into the baraita on yesterday\u2019s page. According to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, a person would not be so brazen as to fully deny a debt no matter who is claiming the debt\u2014the father or his son when the father is deceased. Even if the son is a minor, the debtor would not be so brazen. Therefore, this case of \u201cI owed a maneh to your father and I paid him back half\u201d is like any other admission to a partial debt\u2014the debtor must take an oath. We cannot trust him because psychologically, this is the biggest lie he is capable of.<br>But according to the other rabbis, psychologically people might tell a bald lie to the son of the original debt holder, and deny the whole debt. It is easier to lie to a person when the debt was not directly to him. Since he does not deny the whole debt, we believe him when he says that he has paid back half of the debt. To put this another way, the person was capable of denying any debt whatsoever. When he admits that he owes some of the money, he need not take an oath because he is acting graciously. We should trust him.", "1": "Introduction<br>We now move on to the next Mishnah. It contains another case illustrating the principle of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits,\u201d the operative principle from the first Mishnah of the chapter.", "2": "<b>Section one:</b> In this scenario, a person comes to court with a document signed by witnesses.  When his opponent claims that the document is a forgery, the witnesses are summoned to the court to testify to their signatures.  The witnesses state that the signatures are indeed their signatures, but that nevertheless the document should not be upheld.  This is for one of three reasons:  they were forced to sign, they were minors when they signed, or they were disqualified witnesses (see Mishnah Sanhedrin 3:4).  In this case they are believed, and the document is invalid. This is because of the principle of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits\u201d.  Without the witnesses\u2019 admission that they signed the document, the document would have been invalid.  When they admit that they signed, they are in fact \u201cthe mouth that forbade.\u201d  When they say they were forced, or that they were minors or otherwise disqualified, they are the mouth that permits, and they are believed.  To state this another way, if they had wanted to lie they could have said that this was not their handwriting.<br><b>Section two:</b>  If their signature can be validated in another way, for instance by other witnesses testifying that they recognize the signatures, or by another document that contains their signatures, then the witnesses are not believed when they say that they were forced, or they were minors or otherwise disqualified.  This is not a situation where \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted\u201d.  Since they are not believed to say that they were invalid, their signatures are validated and the document is upheld.", "3": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section discusses the clause in the Mishnah where witnesses say that they did sign the document, but that they did so under duress.", "4": "At this stage of the sugya, Rami b. Hama is understood as relating to the second clause in the Mishnah\u2014the witnesses are not believed to say they signed under duress because there were other witnesses attesting to their signatures. Rami b. Hama says that this is true only if they were essentially bribed to sign on the document. If they claim they were forced by threat to life to sign on the document, then they are believed. The logic seems to be that the witnesses did not have any choice but to sign the document.", "5": "Rava says that a witness cannot simply recant his testimony, even if he claims that he signed under threat to his life. If witnesses could do so, their testimony would essentially be meaningless. This is true whether their testimony was oral or by signing a document\u2014once a person has testified, he cannot recant.", "6": "Due to Rava\u2019s difficulty, the Talmud shifts the section of the Mishnah on which Rami b. Hama was commenting (this is a common move). He was referring to the first clause, where the witnesses are believed to recant their testimony. They are believed only if they claim that they signed under physical duress. If they claim that they signed under the influence of a monetary threat (or bribe) they are not believed, because saying that one accepted a bribe is making oneself out to be wicked. This is a form of self-incrimination, which is generally unacceptable in Jewish law. Therefore, the person is not believed to recant his testimony. His signature on the document will stand.", "7": "Introduction<br>In this last section of this daf, R. Meir argues against the Mishnah, according to which witnesses are allowed to recant their testimony.", "8": "According to the Mishnah, witnesses who signed on a document are believed to say that they signed under duress, were minors or were otherwise disqualified to testify. This would invalidate the document. Here in a baraita we see that this opinion was that of the majority of rabbis, who hold that as long as we have a case of \u201cthe mouth that prohibited [signed] is the same mouth that permits [retracts testimony]\u201d then they are believed.<br>Rabbi Meir, however, disagrees. In essence he is saying we don\u2019t believe the witnesses when they try to retract their testimony. The Talmud asks what his reasoning is.", "9": "Rabbi Meir does not believe witnesses who claim that they were \u201cdisqualified from testifying\u201d because we can assume that the creditor assure that the witnesses were valid witnesses before having them sign the document.", "10": "If the witnesses claim they were minors, and therefore invalid to testify, R. Meir discounts their retraction because there is an overriding presumption that all of the parties to the document, the lender, the borrower and the witnesses, were of majority age."}, "34": {"0": "Hisda explains that if the witnesses claim that they were forced to sign the document they are not believed because had they actually been faced with the choice of signing a false document or being killed, they should have chosen the latter. Therefore, even if they say that they were forced by threat to life, they are incriminating themselves and they are not believed.", "1": "Rava raises a significant problem with R. Hisda\u2019s explanation. We have a tradition that the saving of a life takes precedence over everything except for three prohibitions\u2014idolatry, illicit sexual acts and murder. So he was justified in signing the document under duress, and should be believed later to recant.", "2": "Rav here provides an entirely different reasoning for R. Meir. Once a debtor admits that he wrote up a debt document (or agreed to have one written on his behalf) the creditor need not ascertain the validity of the witnesses. Therefore, this document was already valid. We did not need witnesses to validate it. If so, then we do not have a case of \u201cthe mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits\u201d because it was the debtor that really \u201cprohibited\u201d by admitting that he had the document written up.", "3": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf continues to discuss the tradition that was found at the end of last week\u2019s daf.", "4": "Rav had said that if a borrower admits that he had a debt document written up and signed by witnesses, the lender does not need to confirm it by bringing the witnesses to the court. In this case, the borrower will not be believed to say that he repaid the debt, so long as the document is in the hands of the creditor. Above, this opinion was identified with R. Meir who had said that if the witnesses say they signed the document, they are not believed to say that they did so under duress. R. Nahman therefore criticizes him\u2014why make a statement as if it is anonymous, when really what you\u2019re saying is that the halakhah follows R. Meir?", "5": "Nahman actually disagrees with Rav. When creditors come to his court with signed documents, but without being able to confirm the witnesses, he tells them to go and get the witnesses confirmed. Only then will he allow them to collect the debts.", "6": "Introduction<br>This sugya discusses a \u201cloan document of trust.\u201d This is a document which states that Reuven loaned money to Shimon. However, the loan did not really occur. The document was drawn up so that Reuven could give the money to Shimon any time he wants, without having to find a scribe to write up the document.", "7": "One of the parties to this document holds the document and says that although it says that Reuven loaned to Shimon, Reuven has not yet given the money and therefore Shimon owes him nothing. Rav says the one who makes this statement is believed. The question is\u2014who said that it was only a loan of trust. If it was the debtor, then why should we believe him? By saying that it is only a loan of trust, he is in denying his debt. If the creditor said it, why shouldn\u2019t we believe him. Even if he did really loan the money, he always has a right to forgive the loan.", "8": "So now the Talmud examines the possibility that the witnesses made the statement. But this too is problematic. If we can verify the witnesses\u2019 signatures through another document, then obviously they are not believed. We would have a case here that is not \u201cthe mouth that forbids is the same mouth that permits\u201d for we do not need the witnesses\u2019 testimony at all. And if their signature cannot be verified from elsewhere, then why should they not be believed. This is indeed a case of \u201cthe mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits,\u201d for without their affirmation, the document would not be valid at all.", "9": "Before the explanations begin, the Talmud records a mnemonic to help remember the order of the rabbis.<br>According to Rava (B), it was the debtor who said that it was a deed of trust and he is indeed not believed. Once he has admitted that he had the document written up, he cannot go back and claim that it was only a deed of trust.", "10": "Abaye (A) says that the creditor says it, and yet he is not believed, despite the fact that in most such cases he is only doing injury to himself. This specific case refers to an instance where the creditor also owes money to another party. By denying that this document is a real deed of debt, he is ultimately denying income to the person to whom he owes money. Therefore, he is not believed.", "11": "1. Ashi (SH) says that the witnesses say that it was only a deed of trust, and that this is a case where there was no other confirmation of their signatures. The question asked above is why this is not a case of \u201cthe mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits\u201d and we should believe these witnesses. The answer is that the law prohibits holding on to a deed of trust. Such a deed could lead to unrighteousness, for a person could claim that he is owed money even if he never lent it out. Therefore, we must assume that this is not just a loan of trust and that the creditor actually loaned out the money."}, "35": {"0": "This is further support for why we don\u2019t believe witnesses who say that the deed was only a loan of trust. Since, as we saw above, loans of trust are forbidden and lead to unrighteousness, we make the assumption that the loan document was real, meaning the loan actually occurred.", "1": "Introduction<br>This section continues to deal with unrighteousness and debt documents.", "2": "The verse used here is the same used at the end of yesterday\u2019s section. A creditor should not hold on to a paid debt document, because such a document might be used to collect a second time. Even if he does not intend to use the document in such a way, a person should do all he can to distance himself from such a possibility.", "3": "The \u201cWest\u201d here refers to the land of Israel for it is west of Babylonia. Rav interprets the entire verse from Job as referring to the retention of various types of deeds. The only example we have not yet seen is the \u201cdeed of sale for accommodation.\u201d Elsewhere, Rashi explains that this is a deed through which a person fictitiously gets rid of their property so as to prevent another person from having a claim on them. For instance, a woman might want to give her property to someone else when she gets married so that her husband would have no rights to them. The idea is that she is not really giving him the property\u2014she\u2019s just trying to avoid the property from coming under her husband\u2019s control.", "4": "There were two different opinions as to the application of the verse \u201cAnd let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.\u201d In today\u2019s section it refers to a paid bill of debt, but in yesterday\u2019s section it referred to a loan deed of trust (the loan never happened). As the Talmud often does, it compares these two applications of the verse. The one who says that holding on to a paid bill of debt is morally wrong would also oppose holding on to a loan deed of trust. However, the opposite is not true. The one who opposes holding on to a loan deed of trust may allow one, under certain circumstances, to hold on to a paid bill of debt, for at times the debt is held by the scribe in order for him to collect his fees.", "5": "Introduction<br>The previous section discussed certain documents that one should not keep in one\u2019s house. Today\u2019s section begins with a reference to scrolls (books) of Holy Scripture that one should not have in one\u2019s possession.", "6": "The problem with keeping an uncorrected scroll (of the Bible) in one\u2019s home is that it might be used and the error in the book would then be perpetuated. We must remember that in this period all books had to be copied by hand from another scroll. The fear that an uncorrected version would begin to spread is quite understandable.", "7": "We have already explained what a deed of trust was\u2014a deed drawn up only in case someone needs to borrow money later on. If the witnesses testify that while they did sign the document, the loan was not executed, they are not believed. By signing the document they are testifying that the loan did happen, and once they testify, they cannot retract. Furthermore, as we have learned, it is forbidden to write up such a document in the first place.<br>The same is true if they testify that along with a sale or loan there was a declaration of duress. For instance, Reuven sold his property to Shimon, but along with the sale he told the witnesses that he was doing so only under duress. Again, witnesses are not believed to say this, because a person should not sign such a document in the first place.", "8": "Mar bar Rav Ashi disagrees with Rava concerning the latter case. It is forbidden to write up a deed of trust, as we learned in the past two sections. But it is permitted to write up a document that is accompanied by a declaration in order to protect the seller who was being forced by the buyer to sell. Indeed, one could argue that under certain circumstances one would have to write such a document. Since the document can be written, the witnesses are believed to say that the deed was written up under duress.", "9": "Introduction<br>This section continues yesterday\u2019s discussion concerning witnesses who attest to their signatures on a document but at the same time somehow undermine the document\u2019s validity.", "10": "Rava asks if witnesses are believed if they add that the sale was made on condition and that as far as they know, the condition has not been fulfilled. Are they believed? On the one hand, just as was true in the case of witnesses who testify that the deed was of trust or was accompanied by a declaration, their words would invalidate the document and therefore they should not be believed. On the other hand, maybe they are believed because they are testifying that the document was valid. Their testimony that there was a condition placed on the sale is separate testimony, and perhaps there is no reason to reject it.", "11": "Nahman answered him that indeed the witnesses are believed. When such a document would come in front of him in court, he would tell the parties to go fulfill the conditions attested to by the witnesses, and then they should come back to the court.", "12": "Nahman above determined that witnesses can testify to there being a condition on the document. Here the situation becomes more complex\u2014both witnesses testify to the general validity of the document, but one says that it was accompanied by a condition, and one denies the existence of a condition.<br>Papa says that since we have two witnesses on the document, the document itself is valid. But the condition does not have two witnesses and therefore it not valid.", "13": "Huna son of R. Joshua brings up a problem. Even if they both say that there was a condition we should not believe them because once they have testified to the validity of the document, they cannot testify again as to its invalidity.<br>Rather, in general we consider witnesses who say that there was a condition on the document and that it has not been fulfilled as uprooting their testimony, not adding to it. Therefore, even if one uproots his testimony, the document is left without two valid witnesses and it is invalid.", "14": "Introduction<br>This section discusses a baraita similar to the Mishnah above that illustrated the principle of \u201cthe mouth that prohibited is the same mouth that permits.\u201d", "15": "But if there are other witnesses that this is their handwriting or their handwriting comes out from another place, from a document which was challenged and then confirmed in a court of law, they are not believed.<br>This baraita echoes the Mishnah, except the original witnesses died. Their testimony can be confirmed either by other witnesses who recognize the signature of the original witnesses or by their signatures being compared to another document that had been confirmed in a court.<br>If witnesses testify that this is indeed the signature of the original witnesses, but that their testimony should be invalid for one of three reasons (the same as those found in the Mishnah), then they are believed. This is a case of \u201cthe mouth that prohibits (testifying to the validity of the document) is the same mouth that permits (testifying to the invalidity of the testimony).\u201d<br>However, if the dead witnesses\u2019 signatures can be confirmed from elsewhere we don\u2019t have a case of \u201cthe mouth that permits is the mouth that prohibits.\u201d Therefore, is considered valid, despite the second set of witnesses who have testified to its invalidity.", "16": "The Talmud questions why we should consider this a valid document. After all, we have two witnesses who say that the document is valid and two who say it is not. Why should one set be given priority over the other?<br>Sheshet answers that the original witnesses need to be contradicted in their presence. This is a rule adopted from the rules of rebuttal\u2014cases where the second set of witnesses say that the first set of witnesses were not even there to witness the event, but were with them elsewhere.

Sheshet stated that witnesses can be contradicted only in their presence. Here, R. Nahman challenges that assumption.", "1": "Let\u2019s remind ourselves of the case under discussion. Two witnesses are signed on a document and then die. Their signature is attested to by two other witnesses or confirmed by another document. Then come along two witnesses who say that the original signature was signed under duress or was otherwise not valid. The baraita had ruled that these latter witnesses are not believed and that the document can be used. R. Sheshet had said that this was because the original two witnesses who signed the document were not here such that they could be contradicted. Therefore, their testimony stands. But R. Nahman notes that this is absurd\u2014maybe if they had been here they would have agreed that their testimony was invalid. Why then should the original witnesses\u2019 testimony still stand?", "2": "Nahman said that what happens here is that the sets of witnesses offset each other\u2014one set says the document is valid and one set says it is not. In such a case we are left with no testimony. So what does the court do? The money remains in the hands of the one who possesses it, which is in this case the borrower, who need not pay back the debt. When the baraita said that the latter witnesses were not believed to validate the document, it meant that the document was not torn up. If it were to be confirmed later on, it could be used to collect the debt. Also, if the opposite party (the creditor) were to seize the debt, he would now be the possessor and it would be impossible to take it back from him without proof.", "3": "The above resolution is similar to the ruling of R. Ashi concerning a lunatic who sold property. If he sold it during a time of lucidity, the sale is valid. But if he sold it at a moment of madness, the sale is not valid. There are two sets of witnesses who dispute when he sold the property. R. Ashi says that each set cancels the other out and we are left with no testimony. Since the last known owner is the lunatic, the property remains in his hands.", "4": "The Talmud limits R. Ashi\u2019s rule to a case where the field was part of the lunatic\u2019s heritage. In this case, he is the presumptive owner because it was his family\u2019s field. However, if he himself bought the field, then is not the presumptive owner because it is possible that he acquired it in a moment of lunacy. Therefore, we do not assume that the field is his. It would belong to the person who acquired it from him.", "5": "Introduction<br>To understand the first part of this section I should better explain what \u201crebuttal\u201d (\u05d4\u05d6\u05de\u05d4) of witnesses is and how it differs from contradiction.<br>\u201cRebuttal\u201d is when a second set of witnesses come to the court and say that the first set could not possibly have known that which they testified about, because they were in another place on that day. In other words, they rebut the very possibility that the first set of witnesses could actually be witnesses. Contradiction is simpler\u2014the second set provides different details as to the event (i.e. first group says Joe was the killer and the second group says it was Jon). Another difference is that if witnesses are \u201crebutted\u201d they receive the punishment they tried to dish out on the accused. But if they are only contradicted, no such consequences are suffered.<br>The topic of rebuttal is discussed in the first chapter of Makkot.", "6": "According to R. Abbahu, the laws of rebuttal are more stringent than the laws of contradiction. This is probably due to the seriousness of the punishment of rebutted witnesses. Since they are punished for their false testimony, the accusations against them must be in their presence.", "7": "The Talmud now returns to discussing a baraita from Daf Yod Tet. That baraita had said that if there was a document confirming the witnesses\u2019 signature, then the second set of witnesses are not believed to state that the first set signed under duress, were minors or disqualified in some other way. But for the document to be used to prove the signatures, it must have been contested and then upheld in the court. Otherwise, the second document\u2019s validity is not assured either. A contested and upheld document is known to be valid, similar to the way we require notarization today.", "8": "The Nehardeans, a group of rabbis from the Babylonian city of Nehardea, say that in order to uphold the signatures on a document there need to be either two ketubot to confirm their signatures or sales documents of two fields. The sale of those two fields needs to itself have gone unprotested, meaning the purchasers used the fields for three years without a protest. If the sale of the field went unprotested, we can be sure that the signatures are valid.", "9": "Shimi bar Ashi says that these other two documents used to confirm the signatures in a third document must come from a second party, and not belong to the person who wants to uphold the signatures in the third document. If the party wishing to uphold the documents owns the other two documents, we fear he may have forged the signatures. This would not have been difficult because he owned them both. If the other two documents belong to someone else, then forgery will be more difficult because he would have to look at them, memorize the signatures and then go home and forge them. This is obviously too difficult, almost an impossible task, and therefore we are not concerned with such a possibility.", "10": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section discusses writing a document to remember something that one has seen.", "11": "The baraita teaches that if a person witnesses something, he may write down a written record, an affidavit, of what he saw. Then he may use this document to recall the events he saw and testify about them, even after several years.", "12": "Huna seems to question the legality of remembering the testimony by aid of a document. Therefore, in order for the person to testify, he must remember at least some of the events himself.<br>Yohanan, on the other hand, has no such doubts. Even if he remembers nothing, as long as he wrote something down, he can rely on his written record. Rashi adds that after he looks at the document, he must recall the events himself. In other words, even according to R. Yohanan, he must remember a little. He uses the document to remind himself, but he testifies from what he remembers, not just what is written down.<br>Rabbah takes this a step further. If two people witness an event together and later one forgets what happened, one person can remind another person. This, to Rabbah, is similar to remembering through a written document.", "13": "Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion in yesterday\u2019s section where we learned that if two people witness an event, and one forgets some details, one witness can remind the other of what occurred.", "14": "There is a debate here whether the litigant himself may remind the witness of what he saw. The ruling is that he may not. We fear that since the litigant has a stake in the issue, he may cause the witness to falsely remember the events. The other witness is not a party to the issue, and therefore we trust that he will not unfairly bias the second witness."}, "37": {"0": "If the witness is a Torah scholar, then he may be reminded of his testimony even by the litigant himself. This is illustrated by a story involving Rav Kahana and Rav Ashi. Rav Ashi is reminded of the events by Rav Kahana, but on being reminded, he remembers what happened himself. His testimony is accepted. This seems to be an explanation for the entire sugya\u2014the witness is reminded of his testimony, but we (at times) trust that what he is remembering is his own testimony, and not the words of others being placed in his mouth.

If they are not so near, then it depends on whether they are new or old. It is more likely that one would remember if the mound was used for burial if it is newer.<br>Meir defines near and old in absolute terms\u2014near is fifty cubits and old is sixty years. In contrast, R. Judah offers relative terms. Near means it is the closest mound to the road or town and old is so sold that no one remembers it.", "3": "The Talmud now brings up a problem with the baraita. There is a principle that we don\u2019t assume that ground is impure. So how can we just make a blanket assumption that any mound outside of the city or road is impure?<br>Zera therefore limits the applicability of the rule in the baraita. Only the mounds near a town near a burial place are impure. And only the mounds near a road near a burial place are impure. In other cases, we don\u2019t assume that any old mound was used as a burial place.", "4": "The problem with R. Zera\u2019s solution is that if the town and road are near the burial place, then why would people bury in mounds\u2014why not just bury in the cemetery?<br>With a road this makes some sense, because sometimes it might happen that it gets dark on the way to the cemetery and people fear going there at night. Therefore, they bury in a mound on the side of the road. But if we are talking about a town near a cemetery, why would people bury in mounds and not just go to the cemetery itself?<br>Hanina answers that there are some special categories of people who might bury in one of these mounds, namely people who are not burying bodies, but rather either abortions (or miscarriages) or limbs. The Talmud assumes that the women bury their own miscarriages alone and therefore might fear going too far. If the burial place is close, within fifty cubits, she will go there alone. But if it is further away, she would take a man with her and go to the cemetery. If she cannot find a man, we fear that she might bury the miscarriage in a mound on the side of the road.<br>[R. Hanina\u2019s statement seems to actually explain why people would bury in mounds in the first place. It seems less of an answer as to why we assume that near ones are impure and distant ones are impure.]", "5": "But this general principle is rejected by the Talmud. R. Meir refers to a specific instance\u2014the mounds found outside a city or off a road. It\u2019s not his responsibility to remember what was placed in these mounds, therefore he will not remember it. But if a person is appointed to witness something, he may remember it even after sixty years. A person is more likely to remember something if he is told to remember it.

Note that one person can affirm both signatures, so long as he recognizes them both.  All of this is Rabbi Judah Hanasi\u2019s opinion.  He holds that the witnesses are actually testifying about their signatures and therefore we need two witnesses on each signature.<br>The Sages hold that a person is believed when he affirms his signature.  Therefore, neither needs to bring someone else to join his affirmation.  The Sages reason that the witnesses are actually testifying as to the contents of the document.

To answer this, they explain that it is certain to Rebbe that they are testifying as to their signatures and not the contents of the document. This is true whether it results in a leniency or a stringency (in the Mishnah, Rebbe was strict). For if Rebbe was uncertain, we might have said that in some cases, he would hold that they were testifying to the contents. This would have ramifications in the case where one of the witnesses died. We might have thought that Rebbe would not allow the living witness to testify to the signature of the dead witness for then \u00be of the testimony would be based on one witness (his own half and half of the other witness\u2019s testimony). Therefore, the Mishnah teaches us that Rebbe holds that they are testifying as to their own signature, whether this results in a leniency (as in this case) or a stringency (in the case of the Mishnah).

Therefore Shmuel had to teach us that the halakhah follows the sages.", "8": "The mnemonic at the beginning of this section is meant to help remember who spoke to Rav Judah.

This seems to follow Rebbe\u2019s opinion in the Mishnah\u2014the witnesses testify about the signatures and therefore two witnesses are required to testify on each signature. This contradicts Shmuel\u2019s own ruling, where he says that the halakhah follows the sages, and that each person can testify alone as to his signature.", "9": "The answer is that Shmuel ruled strictly in this case for the deed was related to the property of orphans. Shmuel was worried that if he ruled leniently according to the sages, a subsequent court might rule like Rebbe and thereby disqualify the document.

But this case may be different because there was some testimony in front of at least one of the judges. It may be true that if all three judges recognized the signatures, there would still be a formal need for someone to testify in front of them.", "6": "The third lesson was that there needs to be individual testimony in front of each judge who does not recognize the signature.

Rather, they find replacement judges, and then the two that saw the new moon testify in front of the other judges. If the witnesses could become judges, this would not be necessary.", "9": "A series of amoraim also find this question difficult and eventually the question is answered by Rav.

The problem with this is that he should not be validated by the second set of witnesses, because we have two versus two\u2014two witnesses say he is a thief and two say he is not.

Why would we even need witnesses?<br>The resolution is that the first two testified that he is a robber, but the second two do not deny this. Rather they testify that he has repented.

Yohanan\u2019s halakhah is why there should be a difference between case one (death) and case two (divorce). Abaye interprets case one as a situation where one witness said he died and one said he did not die. The Torah (i.e. halakhah) believes one witness to testify that a woman\u2019s husband has died. This is a leniency to allow her to remarry. Ulla points out that if one witness is categorically believed, the strength of his testimony is equivalent to two witnesses.

R. Yohanan, according to Rava, agreed with R. Menachem b. Yose, who had said that if she was remarried she must leave the second marriage, in the case of death, but not in the case of divorce. In the case of divorce, if her husband comes and says \u201cI did not divorce you\u201d she can say refute him. Therefore, if we were to rely on the first witnesses who say she was divorced, she could remarry even knowing that she was not divorced. Should the husband come and claim that he did not divorce her, she could claim that she was divorced. But in the case of death, if he comes back, she can\u2019t say to him, \u201cHey, you\u2019re dead.\u201d Therefore, we can assume that she will not remarry unless she feels fairly certain that he is indeed dead. So we can allow her to stay married to the second husband.<br>To put this another way, if the risk she takes when remarrying is high, we can trust her not to take it unless she really believes that she is free to remarry.

So how can we base a law on the assumption that if her husband comes and denies having divorced her, she might lie and say directly to him that he did. The answer is that when there are witnesses who support her statement, she might lie to his faceand claim that he did divorce her. R. Hamnuna was referring only to a situation where there were no such witnesses.", "11": "Assi offers a simpler explanation of the situation in R. Yohanan\u2019s halakah\u2014the witnesses say that the death or divorce just occurred. Death cannot be proven (in a case where the body has disappeared) but divorce requires documentation.

Ashi\u2019s reversal of the baraita is that it makes it obvious.

One might have thought that when a man betroths a woman everyone will hear about it. If this were true, there would be significance to people saying, \u201cWe did not see her betrothed.\u201d The baraita teaches us that this is not true.

After all, it is certainly possible that they were raped. But the rule remains fast\u2014we cannot worry about witnesses about whom we know nothing.", "16": "The Talmud brings the discussion back to the initial halakhah at the top of this section. In the story, the woman remains permitted because there are no witnesses. However, the impression we get is that if there were witnesses, she would be prohibited, even if they come after she received permission to marry a priest. This contradicts Avuha DeShmuel\u2019s rule that once she receives permission to marry, she doesn\u2019t lose the permission even if witnesses come.<br>Ashi resolves this by saying that the witnesses referred to at the end of the story testify that they know that she was defiled. With such concrete evidence, she cannot marry a priest. Avuha DeShmuel referred to a case where the witnesses say only that they know she was taken captive, but do not know if she was defiled."}, "43": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section opens with a mishnah that continues to discuss the believability of women who were taken captive and claim that they were not raped.<br>Again, I want to reiterate that I realize that just discussing this issue will cause discomfort. Please do realize that these are legal texts and therefore address the issue in a clinical sense, as do I. It does not mean that I am insensitive to the pain a woman would feel at not being believed that she was raped.", "1": "This mishnah discusses a case in which it is certain that the women were taken captive and hence they are not automatically believed according to the principle of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits.\u201d  The mishnah teaches that the woman herself is not believed to state that she was not raped, and therefore in this case she will not be able to marry a kohen.<br>However, if each woman testifies that the other woman was not raped, each is believed.  This is true even though generally one witness is not sufficient and generally women cannot testify. The rabbis relaxed some of the laws of testimony in this case because there is no certainty that the woman was raped, it is only a likelihood. Furthermore, these women are believed even though there is a fear that each might be covering up the other\u2019s having been raped. The rabbis were lenient in the case of captives and accepted certain types of testimony that would not have been accepted in other types of cases.", "2": "This baraita goes through all of the possibilities of what one woman might say about whether she was raped and whether her friend was raped. The Talmud will now explain each of these scenarios, focusing on the question of whether there were witnesses who testify that they were taken captive.", "3": "The Talmud is now going to first ask whether there were witnesses to the women being taken captive. If there were no witnesses, then this is a case of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.\u201d She should be believed to say that she is pure.", "4": "If there are witnesses, then the second clause becomes problematic. If there were witnesses that the women were taken captive, why should she not believed to say that her friend is impure (was raped)? So, now we go back and assume that there were no witnesses. She is not believed because her friend contradicts her.", "5": "If there are no witnesses, then the last clause becomes problematic. Again, she simply claims that she is pure and we have a situation of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.\u201d", "6": "Abaye affirms that the different clauses refer to different situations. The first and last clause refer to cases where there are witnesses to the fact that they were taken captive. Therefore, she is not believed to say that she was not raped\u2014there is no \u201cmouth that forbade is the mouth that permits.\u201d But the middle clause refers to a case where there are no witnesses. Therefore, she is not believed to say that her friend was raped (assuming that her friend would contradict her).", "7": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section offers a different interpretation of the baraita that was the focus of yesterday\u2019s section. I am copying the baraita again for ease of reference:", "8": "Papa explains the entire baraita as referring to a case where there are witnesses that the women were taken captive, and there is also one witness who always says the opposite of what the woman says. In clause one, she is believed to say that she is impure, because a person always has the power to declare themselves forbidden (or to say that someone else is forbidden to them). And the second woman is permitted based on her testimony, despite the fact that another witness says that she was impure.", "9": "In this case, her own testimony with regard to herself is not sufficient proof that she is pure, as we learned in the Mishnah. She would need at least one witness to attest to her purity. The second person has someone testifying to her purity. Therefore, the one witness is sufficient for her to be considered pure.", "10": "The next clause works using the same logic as above. A person is always believed to say she is impure. But her friend is pure because of the presence of the other witness who says she is pure. The Talmud asks why we even need this clause\u2014we learned the same principles above? The answer is that we might have thought that when she says she is impure, she is just acting as a martyr, \u201cLet me die with the Philistines.\u201d Knowing (or at least thinking) that her friend was raped, she might claim that she was raped too, perhaps to provide some comfort to her friend. Therefore, the baraita says that she is believed to say that she is impure.", "11": "The final clause also uses familiar principles. She is not believed to claim that she is pure, since there are witnesses that she was taken captive. However, the other woman is considered pure based on her testimony.<br>Again, the Talmud asks why we need to learn this twice. At the very outset of the baraita, we learned that she is believed to testify that her friend is pure.<br>The answer is that we might have thought that when she says that both she and her friend are pure, since she is not believed about herself, she is also not believed concerning her friend. Therefore, the Talmud teaches us that even though we do not believe her about herself, we do believe her about her friend.", "12": "Introduction<br>This mishnah illustrates the same principle employed in the previous mishnah, but uses the example of men who claim to be priests. It then goes on to a discussion of how many witnesses are needed to prove that someone is a priest.", "13": "<b>Section one:</b> When each man claims to be a priest, neither is believed and neither will receive terumah.  Just as in the previous mishnah a woman could not testify with regard to her own personal status, so too in this mishnah a man cannot testify with regard to his own status.<br><b>Section two:</b>  However, if both men corroborate the other\u2019s testimony they are believed.<br><b>Section three:</b>  Rabbi Judah disagrees with the idea that one person is believed to testify that another person is a priest.<br><b>Section four:</b>  Rabbi Elazar limits Rabbi Judah\u2019s statement to a case in which other people protest that so-and-so is not a kohen.  In that type of situation two witnesses are necessary to raise someone to the priesthood. However, in the absence of others\u2019 protesting, one witness is believed to say that someone else is a kohen.<br><b>Section five:</b>  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel agrees with the opinion in section two according to which a person is always believed to say that a person is a priest.<br>We should note that determining whether a person was a priest must have been an issue of importance and difficulty after the destruction of the Temple.  When the Temple stood, everyone pretty much knew who the priests were, because they were descendants of those who served regularly in the Temple.  Furthermore, when the Temple was destroyed, the records kept in the Temple were probably lost.  Hence testimony about a person\u2019s being a priest became scarcer and more essential.", "14": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf begins by explaining why we need so many clauses in the Mishnah, all of which seem to illustrate the same point\u2014the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.<br>Some of the details and logic in this section may be difficult to follow. However, what you should focus on is the larger picture. The Talmud is asking why the Mishnah needs to give so many concrete examples of what is really a straightforward principle. This just emphasizes the very nature of the Mishnah. It teaches case law and usually not abstract principles.", "15": "In the first case in the Mishnah of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits\u201d R. Joshua said that a person who says, \u201cThis was your father\u2019s field and I bought it from him\u201d is believed. The first half of the statement could cause him a loss of money. He wouldn\u2019t have said that if he didn\u2019t intend to finish his statement. Therefore he is believed in the second half of the statement, \u201cbut I bought it from him.\u201d But witnesses who admit to having signed a document do not cause themselves any loss. Therefore, there is no extra reason to believe them when they say that they were forced (or some other disqualification). This is why the mishnah needed to add the case of witnesses.", "16": "The Talmud now asks the same question in the other direction\u2014once we have the case of the witnesses, why do we need the case of the person and the field? The answer is that the witnesses\u2019 statement concerns other people, therefore we would tend to believe them. But the person who says that he bought the field is making a statement about himself, to his own benefit. We might have thought not to believe him. Therefore, the mishnah teaches us that we do."}, "44": {"0": "If the mishnah had taught only the cases of the field and the witnesses, I might have thought that the principle of \u201cthe mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits\u201d is invoked only in the case of monetary matters, but not in the case of sexual prohibitions. That is why the mishnah cites the case of the woman who says, \u201cI was married but now I am divorced.\u201d", "1": "The case of a woman who says, \u201cI was taken captive but I am pure\u201d again teaches the same principle, so why do we need it. The answer is that we need it to allow the principle found later that if witnesses come and say that she was taken captive but she has already married a priest, she need not go out of the marriage.", "2": "Earlier we saw that some sages read the line \u201cBut if witnesses came after she got married, she shall not go out\u201d only in reference to the married woman, but not in reference to the captive woman. So why then do we need the clause about the captive woman in the mishnah? The answer is that we would need it segue into the next clause about two women taken captive.", "3": "We need the clause concerning two captive women each who testifies to the other\u2019s purity to teach us that we are not concerned lest they are colluding.", "4": "The case of two men each of whom testifies that the other is a priest is another case where we do not worry about collusion, a principle we have already learned. So why do we need it? The answer is that we need it to allow the mishnah to teach the dispute between the rabbis and R. Judah over whether one witness is sufficient to prove that someone is a priest.", "5": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins a discussion on the evidence required to allow a person to be considered a priest.", "6": "A person comes and testifies that he and his friend are both priests. Although the baraita does not say this, it seems that his friend says the same thing. Thus both testify that the other is a priest. According to the first opinion, both are allowed to eat terumah, but until there is a third witness who can testify that both are priests, neither is allowed to marry a woman with proper lineage, a woman whom would normally be married only by a priest.<br>1. Judah says that we do not even let them eat terumah until we have two witnesses to testify for both men.", "7": "According to the Talmud Rabbi Judah says that we need two witnesses for each priest, even to allow them to eat terumah, because he fears collusion. That is why the one priest is not believed to say that his friend is a priest. This is now contrasted with another baraita in which R. Judah seems to say the opposite.<br>In this baraita, donkey-drivers come to town, each praising the other\u2019s produce, either by saying it is old (which is better) or that the tithes have been removed. R. Judah says that they are believed, implying that he does not fear collusion, the opposite of his opinion in the earlier baraita.<br>There are two solutions to the contradiction. The first is to reverse the attributions in the second baraita. The second is to differentiate between the issues. In the donkey-driver baraita we can be lenient because it is only \u201cdemai\u201d which is produce bought from an am haaretz (a person who is not scrupulous in observance). Since most ammei haaretz do tithe R. Judah can be lenient in this case.", "8": "We now must resolve the position of the rabbis. Why do they believe the priests and not the donkey-drivers? The answer is from R. Hama b. Ukba, who says that he brings his trade-tools with him, in this case tools used to sell his produce. If each donkey-driver praises the others, but also brings trade-tools to sell his produce, then we should be suspicious that they are colluding with each other. If they were each being honest in disparaging their own produce, they would not have their trade tools with them."}, "45": {"0": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section the editors of the Talmud used a statement by R. Hama bar Ukba to resolve a difficulty. But the original context of his statement was not clear. Today the Talmud turns its attention to that context.", "1": "The context in which R. Hama b. Ukba made his statement is the contradiction between a mishnah and a baraita concerning the purity of pots left by the side of the road. A potter who wished to preserve the purity of his pots, left them for a few moments unguarded. When he returns he must regard the outer ones as defiled lest an am haaretz, a Jew who does not preserve his purity, touched them with his cloaks which are considered impure. However, the inner pots are pure, according to the Mishnah.<br>But a baraita states that all of the pots, even the inner ones, are impure.", "2": "Hama b. Ukba resolves the difficulty by stating that all of the vessels are impure when the potter has his selling tools in hand. If everyone knows that he is selling the pots, everyone will handle them and thereby defile them.", "3": "The Talmud now cites another baraita that says all of the vessels, the inner and the outer ones, are pure. This too contradicts the Mishnah.<br>Hama b. Ukba answers this in the opposite fashion. When the potter does not have his trade-tools in hand, no one will touch the vessels, so they all remain pure.", "4": "If all of the vessels are pure when the potter does not have his trade tools, and they are impure when he does have his trade-tools, when does the Mishnah\u2019s law, that the outer ones are impure and the inner ones are pure, apply?<br>The answer is that it applies when these vessels are left near the public road. They are impure because of the \u201cborder stones\u201d on the public road. Rashi explains that people would put big stones in the public domain to keep travelers from encroaching onto their property or rubbing against their walls. This potter also left his wares in the same place. People walking on the public domain would be crowded and have to make their way over such obstacles. The clothes of an am haaretz defile, and so when their clothes hang over the vessels, they defile them.", "5": "This section refers to the dispute at the beginning of section two, between R. Judah and the rabbis. The rabbis said he is allowed to eat terumah and R. Judah said he is not. The earlier explanation was that they disagreed over whether we should be concerned about collusion. Here we have a new explanation. R. Judah holds that once a person is seen eating terumah he can be assumed to be a kohen and would be allowed to marry a woman usually only married to a kohen. Therefore, we cannot allow him to eat terumah until we are sure he is a kohen. The other rabbis say that eating terumah is not sufficient evidence that he is a kohen. Therefore, we can let him eat terumah even without proper testimony.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to deal with the question of what evidence is necessary to determine that a person is a Kohen.", "7": "The question asked is whether evidence from a document would be sufficient to prove that someone was a priest in order for him to be allowed to marry a woman who only marries a priest.<br>We now need to delve into the particulars of this case. What evidence can there be in a document. The first possibility is that the document has the person\u2019s signature and he signed as a Kohen. The problem is that this is not evidence that he is a Kohen\u2014no one has testified here that he is a Kohen. Only he did.", "8": "The document is a loan document in which a person borrowed money and the document explicitly says that he is a priest. Witnesses have signed on this document. However, it is not clear whether they are testifying only to the loan, or whether they are testifying to the veracity of everything stated in the document, including that the borrower is a priest, information not necessary for the loan to go through.", "9": "This section ends with an amoraic dispute on the subject\u2014one amora holds that documentary evidence is sufficient to prove that he is a kohen, and one holds that it is not.", "10": "Introduction<br>Here we have another question concerning the evidence necessary to prove that someone is a Kohen", "11": "If a person is seen in synagogue blessing the priestly benediction and raising up his hands, as remains the custom for kohanim to do to this day in many places, is this sufficient evidence that he is a Kohen?", "12": "The question of whether lifting up of the hands is sufficient evidence that a person is a priest is asked regardless of how one rules on the question of whether eating terumah is sufficient evidence.<br>The one who holds that eating terumah is sufficient evidence could say that since a non-priest who eats terumah has transgressed a prohibition punishable by death (meted out by heaven), no one who is not a priest would dare eat terumah. In other words, the severity of the prohibition would deter anyone who is not sure he is a priest from eating terumah. Therefore, this is evidence that he must be a priest. But one who lifts up his hands and recites the priestly blessing even if he is not a priest has transgressed a more minor commandment. Therefore he might do so even if he is not completely certain he is a priest, and lifting up of the hands would not be sufficient evidence of being a priest.<br>Alternatively, this position could say that both acts, lifting up of the hands and eating terumah, are sufficient evidence of being a priest.", "13": "The one who says that eating terumah is not sufficient evidence for being a priest could still be asked whether \u201clifting up of the hands\u201d is. Eating terumah is a private act, and it is simply easier to transgress in private. It does not require so much chutzpah. But it would require a lot of chutzpah for a non-kohen to get up in front of the community and bless everyone as if he were a Kohen. Therefore, we can assume that anyone who does so is a Kohen.<br>Or there is no difference, and neither act is sufficient evidence that one is a priest.", "14": "Again, this section ends with a dispute between two amoraim.", "15": "Introduction<br>This section continues to ask the same question we saw yesterday\u2014is the lifting up of the hands sufficient evidence to prove that someone is a priest.", "16": "This is a continuation of the discussion among the next generation of amoraim. R. Nahman b. Yitzhak asks his teacher, Rava, what the accepted practice is.", "17": "As the answer to the question, Rava cites a baraita that interprets a passage from Ezra. In this passage the priestly lineage of some families returning from Babylonia to Israel is called into question. The governor (Tirshata) says to them that they may not eat the most holy things, namely sacrifices, until a priest comes who can divinely determine their lineage. However, they may continue in their presumed state. In Babylonia they eat \u201choly things eaten outside of Jerusalem,\u201d namely terumah. So too on their return they may continue to eat terumah. This is evidence of how significant a concept \u201cpresumption\u201d is. A person retains their presumed status until proven otherwise.", "18": "Rava now explains how he uses this baraita as proof that a person seen \u201clifting up their hands\u201d cannot be assumed to be a priest. Assumedly, these people who came back from Babylonia and ate terumah would also spread out their hands and offer the priestly blessing. Yet clearly, the governor does not assume that they are full priests, for they still cannot eat sacrifices. Therefore, Rava concludes, in general we cannot assume that one who lifts up his hands is a priest such that he could marry a woman only married by priests.", "19": "The Talmud rejects Rava, claiming that this situation is different. In this situation we can allow them to lift up their hands without worrying that this will cause people to think they are full priests because their presumption of being priests was damaged. Everyone will know that these particular people can lift up their hands, but we\u2019re not certain that they are priests. For if we did not say this, then this baraita would have been a difficulty on the position that says that one can be raised from eating terumah to being a full priest. These people clearly ate terumah, and yet we know they were not fully treated as priests. Therefore we must say that this is a special category, from which we cannot derive the halakhah in more normal situations."}, "46": {"0": "The Talmud now returns to interpreting the baraita. What is so great about presumption if all it means is that they can continue to act in the way they were already acting?<br>The first answer is that in Babylonia they were eating terumah whose status was only rabbinical. Outside the land of Israel the separation of terumah from produce is not of the higher status of from the Torah. But when these families come back to Israel they will be able to eat terumah of the higher status\u2013\u201cfrom the Torah.\u201d This shows us how strong the legal principle \u201cpresumption\u201d is.", "1": "The Talmud now brings up another possibility altogether for how to interpret this baraita in light of the question of raising a person who is seen eating terumah to the status of full priest. Perhaps in the case in the baraita they ate only terumah of the lower status, rabbinic terumah, even when they returned to Israel. [According to the Torah one does not separate terumah from vegetables, but the rabbis mandated it.] And while we do raise a person seen eating terumah to the status of priest, this is only when he eats toraitic terumah (wine, grain and oil). Eating rabbinic terumah is not sufficient evidence of being a priest.<br>The greatness of presumption is that they are allowed to eat rabbinic terumah, even though they are not allowed to eat toraitic terumah.", "2": "The Talmud now questions whether these doubtful priests did not eat toraitic terumah. The verse seems to say that they did not eat \u201cmost holy things,\u201d i.e. sacrifices. But they would have eaten terumah, which is not a sacrifice.", "3": "The Talmud clarifies that these priests could not eat anything that could be called \u201choly thing.\u201d This includes terumah, referred to as \u201choly\u201d in Leviticus 22:10, as well as parts of regular sacrifices eaten by priests, such as the hind leg and the breast, referred to in verse 12. These were the parts of the animal given to the priests from sacrifices such as the wellbeing offering.<br>In the end, the only terumah these people could eat was that of rabbinic status. Eating such terumah is not evidence that one is a priest. But some hold that eating toraitic terumah is evidence that one is a priest.", "4": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf continues with the discussion of whether \u201clifting up of the hands\u201d is sufficient evidence that one is a Kohen, such that he would be allowed to marry a woman who would only marry a Kohen.", "5": "The Talmud cites a baraita that seems to offer proof that a Kohen seen lifting up his hands in the priestly blessing is assumed to be a Kohen. This is true even in Babylonia, where the status of terumah and hallah (dough given to the priest) is from rabbinic law, and therefore it is not sufficient evidence to accord him the status of full priest.<br>In Syria (lands bordering Israel to the north) hallah and terumah are of toraitic status (at least according to this baraita, as it is currently understood). Therefore, if a person is seen eating them, he can be assumed to be a Kohen.<br>Finally, if he is seen in a large city eating the priestly gifts, the breast or foreleg of a sacrificial animal, he can also be assumed to be a Kohen. While these parts of the animal can be eaten by a non-priest, Rashi explains that in places where a person would easily be seen by others, we can assume that only a priest would eat these things.<br>The Talmud subsequently rejects this understanding of the baraita. A person seen lifting up his hands is not assumed to be a priest for all matters, including marriage. He is only assumed to be a priest such that he could eat terumah.", "6": "The Talmud now again tries to prove that the baraita implies that one seen lifting up his hands is accorded the full status of priest. Just as one who is seen eating hallah can be assumed to be a priest for all matters (and not just for eating terumah, since eating hallah is equivalent to eating terumah), so too lifting up the hands is sufficient evidence.", "7": "The Talmud again goes back to saying that lifting up the hands is sufficient only to prove that he can eat terumah. According to this reading of the baraita, one seen eating hallah is also not accorded full status of priest\u2014he too is only allowed to eat terumah. But this is a rise in status, for he goes from eating hallah which has the status of rabbinic authority (derabanan) to being able to eat terumah, which has the status of being of biblical origins. Thus both lifting up of the hands and eating hallah allow us to assume that he is a priest, but only in a limited way\u2014to allow him to eat terumah. Neither is sufficient to allow him to marry a woman who would only marry a Kohen.<br>The Talmud refers to a statement by R. Huna son of R. Joshua. This will appear later on this page.", "8": "Introduction<br>We continue the lengthy discussion concerning what constitutes proof that a person is a Kohen.", "9": "This baraita discusses what constitutes proof that a person is a priest depending on the region in which the action is performed. In Israel either the recitation of the priestly blessing or receiving terumah grain on the threshing floor is proof. In Syria, Babylonia and other places close to Israel where messengers would arrive to declare the New Moon, lifting up of the hands is evidence but receiving terumah is not evidence. According to R. Shimon b. Gamaliel Alexandria also has the status of Syria and Babylonia because there was a permanent court there.", "10": "The Talmud now concludes the proof from the baraita that lifting up of the hands is proof that one should have the full status of priest and be allowed to marry a woman who marries into the priesthood.<br>As with above, they initially try to reject this. Lifting up the hands is proof that one can receive hallah (dough given to priests). But it might not be sufficient for full proof that one is a priest.", "11": "The problem with the above is that lifting up of the hands seems to be equated with receiving terumah at the threshing floor. Terumah and hallah generally have the same status. So if receiving terumah is evidence that one is a full priest and can marry a woman who marries into the priesthood, so too should lifting up of the hands be evidence that one should be fully accorded the status of priest.", "12": "The Talmud now reinstates the idea that lifting up of the hands might only be proof that someone may receive hallah. The baraita could hold that terumah in our days (post-Temple) is only of rabbinic status, but hallah is of biblical status. So if one is seen lifting up the hands or receiving terumah he is elevated to the status of being able to eat biblical hallah. But he is not elevated to being able to marry a woman who marries only a priest.", "13": "The above discussion leads to the citation of a relevant discussion in which some rabbis and R. Huna son of R. Joshua debate the status of terumah and hallah in the post-Temple period. According to the rabbis found by R. Huna in the Bet Rav (the study hall), hallah is of biblical status. This is because during the fourteen years it took to conquer and settle Israel after their entrance into Canaan, they were obligated in hallah but not terumah. This, according to the rabbis, implies that hallah has higher status.", "14": "Huna son of R. Joshua uses a baraita to prove that the status of hallah is rabbinical unless all of Israel comes to the land. Just as in the original conquest of the land the Israelites were not obligated in hallah until everyone had entered the land, so too in post first Temple times, the Jews are no longer obligated by the Torah to give hallah, since not all of the Jews returned with Ezra to build the Second Temple.<br>In any case, the baraita at the beginning of the page could be understood in light of the opinion that hallah is of biblical status. A priest seen eating terumah (or lifting up his hands) can eat hallah which is of biblical status. But he cannot necessarily marry a woman who marries only into the priesthood."}, "47": {"0": "Introduction<br>Yes. You guessed it. The discussion over what constitutes evidence that one is a priest continues.", "1": "After this baraita was corrected, it seems to offer conclusive proof that if a priest is seen lifting up his hands in the priestly blessing, he can be assumed to be a priest and he can be allowed to marry a woman who marries into the priesthood. \u201cLifting up the hands\u201d has the power of actual testimony.", "2": "The Talmud again rejects the idea that \u201clifting up the hands\u201d is sufficient evidence to elevate someone to the full status of priest. It is not \u201clike testimony.\u201d Rather, what the baraita means to say is that testimony that someone performed an action creates a presumption that is treated like presumption itself. This accords with a story in which a man testifies before R. Ammi that he saw a person get the first Aliyah and that a Levite read after him. Since a Levite can take the second Aliyah only if the first one was given to a priest, we can assume the first Aliyah went to a priest. R. Ammi raised him to the status of priesthood, but only insofar as he could eat terumah. He was still not allowed to marry a woman of high lineage.", "3": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section contains a story very similar to that in yesterday\u2019s section. The only difference is that the person is being raised to the status of Levite and not priest. The story is straightforward, so there is no commentary below.", "4": "This story begins like the stories in the previous two sections. However, here Resh Lakish seems to imply that seeing someone read the first Aliyah is not sufficient evidence that someone is a priest. He wants to know if he was seen receiving terumah on the threshing floor, which would constitute a higher level of evidence.<br>Elazar attacks Resh Lakish, noting that if we demand receiving terumah on the threshing floor, what will people do who do not live in a place where people do not have a threshing floor for whatever reason.", "5": "The same story now occurs again but this time Resh Lakish and R. Elazar are sitting in front of R. Yohanan, their master. This time R. Yohanan says the same line that R. Elazar said above. This angers Resh Lakish for R. Elazar was basically plagiarizing. Had R. Elazar admitted that he was saying something in the name of R. Yohanan, Resh Lakish might have accepted it from him. Note that Resh Lakish refers to R. Yohanan as a smith\u2019s son, an appellation he receives elsewhere.", "6": "Both of these are breaches of the normal rules of testimony\u2014a brother cannot testify concerning his brother nor can a father for his son. But for the issue of verifying whether a person is a Kohen or Levite, the rules were relaxed.", "7": "A baraita is cited to prove that Rabbi was the one who held that a father\u2019s testimony is sufficient to prove that the son is a priest. Rabbi explains that if a father testifies that his son is a priest we can allow the son to eat terumah, because the father is a priest himself and would have terumah to give to his son. However, the father cannot unilaterally let him marry a woman, so we don\u2019t accept the father\u2019s testimony that he is a priest.<br>This proves that Rabbi is the sage who holds that we accept a father\u2019s testimony that his son is a priest.", "8": "Hiyya must have been the sage who raised a son to the status of Levite, but now we are left with a problem. In the above baraita, R. Hiyya did not allow a son to be raised to the priesthood based on the testimony of his father. So why the inconsistency? After all, both are relatives who cannot testify?<br>The resolution is that the brother was not actually testifying that his brother was a Levite. He was innocently talking and said something through which we could determine that his brother was a priest."}, "48": {"0": "This is an example of a person who was talking innocently. The speaker remembers when he was a kid and they treated him as a priest, immersing him so that he could eat terumah and hallah. His friends were even making fun of him, calling him a \u201challah-eater\u201d (not sure what\u2019s so bad about this, but I guess kids are always making fun of those different).<br>In any case, this is proof that R. Hiyya would allow a person to be raised to the priesthood based on the innocent talk of a relative. Had the relative actually testified, he would not have been believed. The idea seems to be that since the person is not intending to testify, we do not have to fear that he is lying for the benefit of his relative.", "1": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf continues the discussion of what constitutes evidence for being a Kohen or Levi.", "2": "Shimon ben Elazar puzzlingly states that one who is seen receiving first tithe at the threshing floor, can be assumed to be a priest. The Talmud will immediately clarify some puzzling aspects of this baraita.", "3": "The Talmud identifies the position in the earlier baraita with R. Elazar ben Azariah who holds that the first tithe belongs to the priest.", "4": "The problem is that R. Elazar ben Azariah seems to have said that the first tithe could go to the Levite or the priest. If so, eating or receiving first tithe is not proof that one is a priest\u2014one could be a Levite or a priest.<br>The Talmud answers that after Ezra punished the Levites for not returning to Zion, he dictated that the first tithe would go exclusively to the priest. This is a notion explained elsewhere in the Talmud. The important thing would be that by the time of the Mishnah, only priests received the tithe (note\u2014R. Akiva would disagree).", "5": "The problem is that even though the first tithe was, according to R. Elazar ben Azaryah, given to priests, most rabbis held that it could be eaten by non-priests and it certainly may be eaten by Levites. So how could we know that this person who received first tithe is a priest?<br>Hisda answers that the baraita refers to a person whose father was known to be a priest. The doubt concerning him is that his mother may have been a divorcee or halutzah (woman released from Levirate marriage). A priest may not marry such a woman. The offspring of such a union is not considered a priest.<br>In any case, we know that he is not a Levite\u2014his father was known to be a priest.", "6": "But what if his mother was a divorcee or halutzah? Here, we can point the question at both sides of a debate over whether non-priests can eat first tithe. According to the opinion that holds that they may not, clearly they would not have given first tithe to this person on the threshing floor. After all, there is a rumor that he is not a priest.<br>But even according to the opinion that holds that first tithe is permitted to non-priests, this is only to eat it. No one holds that non-priests would be given first tithe at the threshing floor. Therefore, the fact that this person did receive first tithe at the threshing floor is proof that they consider him a priest. [Remember, we know that he is not a Levite].", "7": "The Talmud now explains the second half of the baraita, which seems to be equally puzzling. How can taking a share of terumah at the court not create the presumption that one is a priest. R. Sheshet answers that the baraita refers to a person dividing up his father\u2019s property in court. Note that it is possible for one son to be a priest and his paternal brother not to be a priest, if for instance one of the mother\u2019s was a divorcee. Such a son could receive some of his father\u2019s terumah, but he could not eat it. He would have to sell it.", "8": "The final question is that the baraita seems obvious\u2013just because someone gets terumah at a court does not mean that he is a priest. However, in the end, the Talmud resolves that the baraita\u2019s teaching is not so obvious. We might have thought that just as some sons are going to be able to eat the terumah they receive, so too all of the sons will be able to eat the terumah they receive. Therefore the baraita teaches that this is not so. We must be concerned that the son about whom there is a rumor that his mother was a divorcee or a halutzah, is not actually a priest.", "9": "Introduction<br>While the Talmud does begin her to explain another clause in the Mishnah, it is still dealing with the same topic\u2014the evidence necessary to prove that a person is a priest. This is the last section dedicated to this subject.<br>I should note that the Talmud quotes a section of the Mishnah that it does not deal with. This is a phenomenon that occurs sometimes. These quotes of the Mishnah were placed there to help the reader understand the context of the discussion. But on occasion, the quote is wrong.", "10": "Shimon ben Gamaliel in the Mishnah had stated that one witness is sufficient in order to prove that someone is a priest. This, to the Talmud seems to be the same as R. Eliezer (the Mishnah itself reads R. Elazar) who said the following:<br>Rabbi Elazar says: When is this true?  When there are people who object; but when there are no people who object, one raises [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.<br>Both of these sages seem to agree that if there are no objections, one witness is sufficient. And as far as what constitutes a successful objection, both agree that two people are needed to object. If one only objects, then the person still may be raised to the priesthood.", "11": "The Talmud now cooks up an extremely complicated scenario in order to determine whether or not this person was a priest. He starts off under the assumption that he is a priest, then he is demoted based on a rumor that his mother was not allowed to marry a priest. They then raised him to the priesthood (on the basis of one witness), then demoted again (on the basis of two witnesses) and then another witness comes and testified that he is a priest."}, "49": {"0": "The Talmud now explains that the real debate is over whether we are concerned that a court that first demotes a person from the priesthood and then promotes him again will be disgraced. According to the first opinion (R. Eliezer/Elazar), it will and therefore, once demoted he may not be promoted again. And according to R. Shimon ben Gamaliel we are not concerned, and therefore although once demoted, he may be promoted again.", "1": " Ashi points out that if this is the debate, why did the scenario have to involve two witnesses testifying separately? The scenario could have been much simpler\u2014two come to testify that he is not a priest and then two other witnesses testify that he is.", "2": "Instead R. Ashi says that Rabbi Eliezer and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel are disputing whether the testimonies of two witnesses who testify on separate occasions can be joined together. According to R. Eliezer they cannot (like the anonymous opinion in the baraita) and according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel they can (with R. Natan in the baraita).", "3": "Introduction<br>As I have mentioned before, if a married woman was raped she may return to her husband but only if he is an Israelite.  If he is a priest, she is forbidden from returning to her husband.  If she willingly had sexual relations with another man, the she is forbidden to her husband, even if he is only an Israelite. Today\u2019s mishnah refers to a woman imprisoned by non-Jews, asking whether she is permitted to return to her husband.", "4": "There is fear that that a woman imprisoned by non-Jewish authorities had sexual relations with one of them. According to the mishnah, if she was taken in order to collect money, the captors assumedly did not have relations with her, because they would fear that if they rape her they will not get the money they want.  In this case, she is not prohibited to her husband, even if he is a priest.<br>However, if they took her and intended to execute her, and then she somehow escapes or is let free, she is prohibited to her husband, even if he is an Israelite.  The concern is that in order to endear herself to her captors, she willingly had sexual relations with them.<br>Others explain this clause to refer only to the wife of a priest. If she was taken for monetary gain, they did not rape her and she may return to her priestly husband.  However, if she was seized for execution, the captors would not hesitate to rape her and she is forbidden to her husband the priest. According to this explanation, there is no concern that she willingly had relations with her captor(s) and therefore, if her husband was an Israelite she is in all cases permitted to him.<br>Rashi explains in the first manner, and I will generally adhere to that explanation below.", "5": "Rav limits the context of the Mishnah to a case where Israel is sovereign. In such a case, the non-Jews will fear raping the woman they have imprisoned for fear of a reprisal. Thus the only concern would be if she was sentenced to death.<br>But if the non-Jews are ruling, then even if she was taken in order to pay back a debt and there is no fear of execution, she would still be prohibited to her husband. If the non-Jews rule, then the possibility of rape would be even greater.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section is a direct continuation of yesterday\u2019s section.", "7": "Rava uses a mishnah from Tractate Eduyot as a difficulty against Rav who said that if the non-Jews ruled over Israel, the woman would be forbidden even if she was imprisoned for monetary matters.<br>My explanation of this mishnah in Mishnah Yomit was as follows:<br>In the sad case under discussion in this mishnah a girl is taken by gentile debt collectors as security on a debt that a Jewish family owes them. The family, assuming that the girl has been raped by the gentiles, distances themselves from her. This \u201cdistancing\u201d means that they refused to marry her (those in the family that would have been eligible to marry her, such as uncles and cousins), even though there was no law that prevented them from doing so. This family distanced her even though she had witnesses who testified that she had not been so much as secluded with a gentile, let alone raped.  The Sages respond by telling the family that their position vis-a-vis the girl is illogical. If they believed the witnesses that she had been taken as collateral, then they must believe the same witnesses who testify that she had not been raped.  If they don\u2019t believe the witnesses that she had not been raped, then they shouldn\u2019t believe them that she had been taken in the first place. The Sages do not tolerate the family\u2019s overly stringent and extremely cruel position. While the Sages did believe that under certain circumstances, a girl who had been raped could no longer marry certain men (priests), they did not seek to compound this difficult situation by assuming that this had happened when witnesses testify explicitly that it had not. The family\u2019s distancing the girl is a case of a stringency run amok, and one against which the Sages rightly put down their halakhic feet.", "8": "Rava now explains the difficulty. This woman would have been prohibited to return to her husband in the absence of witnesses, because she was taken as collateral. Since the time to repay the loan had passed, we can assume that she had been raped. But if she was merely imprisoned in order to gain a ransom, the case in the Mishnah, then she should be permitted to return to her husband, even though Ashkelon was a city where the non-Jews ruled.\n"}, "50": {"0": "The resolution is that it does not matter\u2014whether taken as collateral or imprisoned, she is forbidden to return to her husband without witnesses that she was not defiled. Since Ashkelon was ruled by non-Jews, we have to assume that she was defiled by them. This mishnah can now accord with Rav\u2019s opinion from yesterday\u2019s section.", "1": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section is basically identical to that in yesterday\u2019s section, just reversed. The Mishnah is brought by Rava as support for Rav (in section 3) and then the support is rejected.<br>I have offered no explanation of the mishnah itself, since it was explained at length in yesterday\u2019s section.", "2": "Here, Rava explains how the mishnah could support Rav\u2019s statement. Ashkelon was a city in which non-Jews ruled. Hence, even though she was taken for money, she would have been forbidden to return to her husband, were it not for the fact that there were witnesses who testified that she had not been defiled. And it would not matter whether she was taken as a pledge, or imprisoned.", "3": "The Talmud rejects the use of the mishnah as support for Rav. If she was taken as a pledge, she would not be permitted to return to her husband without witnesses. In such a case, we could assume that she was raped. But if she was imprisoned, she would be permitted in any case, even though the non-Jews ruled in Ashkelon.", "4": "Introduction<br>This section contains a third version of the same passage we have seen above. In this version, instead of Rava using a mishnah to support or object to Rav, the two tannaitic sources are contrasted and then resolved.", "5": "The two tannaitic sources seem to contradict each other. The mishnah from Ketubot says that if she is taken for money, she is permitted to return to her husband. But the mishnah in Eduyot (R. Yose testified\u2026\u2013the source is abbreviated since we\u2019ve already seen it twice) is a case where the woman was taken for money and had it not been for the witnesses, she would not have been permitted to return to her husband.<br>Shmuel bar Yitzhak (the same sage who transmitted Rav\u2019s statement in section three) resolves the difficulty. When the non-Jews rule, she is not permitted without testimony that she was not defiled. This is what happened in Ashkelon. And when the Jews rule, she is permitted, as long as she was taken only for money. This is the case in Ketubot.", "6": "The end of this passage relates to the last clause of the Mishnah. Rav and Levi both give examples of cases where a woman would be imprisoned only to execute her. According to Rav, wives of thieves are executed. According to Levi, only wives are murderers are executed. Ben Dunai was a famous Jewish murderer referred to elsewhere in the Talmud. But according to Levi, wives of thieves would not executed.", "7": "According to Hezekiah, the women are prohibited only if they have already been sentenced to death. In such a case, they will be raped by the imprisoners. R. Yohanan says that they may be raped even before sentencing. He may fear that the women will intentionally sleep with their imprisoners in order to avoid the death sentence.", "8": "If a city has been captured by foreign soldiers, there is concern that the women of the city were raped.  Therefore, all of the women married to priests are forbidden to their husbands.  However, if a woman has a witness who can testify that she was not raped, even if that witness is a slave or a female slave, the witness is believed and the woman is not prohibited to her husband.", "9": "The Talmud cites a baraita that contradicts our Mishnah. The issue in this baraita is the concern that wine might have been offered as a libation by a non-Jew. So if a Gentile troop comes into town, only the open casks are forbidden. Closed casks are permitted because it is possible to tell that they have not been opened. But in a time of war, we are more lenient. Even open casks are permitted, because the troops would not have had time to offer libations. But this contradicts the mishnah which is concerned lest the troops raped the women of the town, even, or perhaps especially, in a time of war.", "10": "Mari basically confirms that there are different halakhot for each concern. The marauding troops will make sure they have enough time to rape the women of the city. But they won\u2019t make enough time to offer libations. In other words, these are pillaging troops\u2014they will give priority to what interests them most.", "11": "This is a different resolution. If the troop comes from the same kingdom as the Jewish city, then they will not rape or offer libations, since they are in essence part of the same political entity. But if they are from another kingdom, we would need to be concerned both for rape and that the wine was offered as a libation.", "12": "The basic question asked here is that even if the besieging troop is from the same kingdom, how do we know that all of the soldiers obeyed the policy and didn\u2019t rape or offer libations with the wine. There are two parts to the answer. First of all, the soldiers must be guarding one another. In other words, there must be some evidence that the troop is law abiding. Second, they must set up some sort of alarm system around their own troops to make sure that if one soldier tries to run off and rape and pillage, he will be heard and stopped. Without such assurances that the troops are law abiding, we would have to be concerned about rape and about the wine.", "13": "This is a slightly different version of the above questions and resolutions. One of these two sages is not concerned that a lone soldier would leave his troops and go rape and offer libations. Therefore, as long as the besieging troop is from the same kingdom, we need not have any concerns. The other says we must be concerned for the lone soldier. Without a system of guards, the women and wine would be prohibited.", "14": "Introduction<br>This section continues to relate to the Mishnah according to which the women in a city conquered by marauding troops are forbidden to return to their husbands (if they are priests) out of fear that they were raped.", "15": "This halakhah offers a significant leniency\u2014if there is one place in which these women could have hidden from the besieging troops, we can act as if all of the women were there. They would all be permitted to return to their priestly husbands under the assumption that they were hiding when the city was conquered.", "16": "Yirmiyah asks what the halakhah is if we know that the hiding place could fit only one woman. Do we pretend that any given woman might have been the one to hide there, even if we know that not all of the women could have hidden there? Or do we not?", "17": "The Talmud compares the situation of a hiding place in which only one woman could have hidden with a case of two paths, one clean and the other unclean (due to the burial of a dead body). If one person walks down one path and another person down the other, we know for certain that at least one of them was defiled. The tannaim disagree over whether we must assume that all of the clean food they prepared is considered defiled.", "18": "Rava limited the dispute in the mishnah to a case where one person came to ask whether the food he had prepared was pure and at the same time he asked about the other person\u2019s food. R. Judah would say that this is similar to a case where they ask separately, and therefore we are allowed to presume that they are both clean, even though this is not possible. And R. Yose would say that since one person is asking about both men at the same time, this must be treated like a case where both come to ask if they are pure at the same time, and they must both be treated as defiled.", "19": "The analogy between the two cases is drawn. In the case of the besieged city, all of the women were permitted at the same time. This is like the case of two men coming to ask if they are pure at the same time. Since we assume the men are impure (even though one is not) we should also assume that the women are impure, even though we know for sure that one is not.", "20": "The Talmud now rejects the comparison. In the case of the two paths, we know for sure that one of them has been defiled. Therefore, if they come to ask at the same time, we have no choice but to treat both as if they were defiled. But in the case of the women, we do not know that anyone was raped, we are only concerned. Therefore, since we are only dealing with suspicions, we can be lenient. If there is a hiding place for one, all women may be considered pure and allowed to return to their priestly husband.", "21": "This woman admits that she did not hide in the hiding place which would have protected her from being raped. However, at the same time she says that she was not defiled, i.e. she was not raped. Do we say that she should be believed, for after all, why would she say such a lie, when she could have just said that she did hide? Or do we not believe her."}, "51": {"0": "The Talmud compares the above situation of the woman with a case that came before Rava. Rava believed the man who said that he went by way of Pekod, but that there was no water there, and the donkey did not die from his own negligence. If the man had wanted to lie, he could have said that they went by way of Naresh.<br>Abaye disagrees. If there are witnesses, we do not say \u201cwhy should he lie.\u201d According to Rashi, there are witnesses in the sense that we know that there is usually water in Nehar Pekod. The man is not believed to say that which contradicts what we know to be true.", "1": "The Talmud now points out the difference between the two situations. In the case of Nehar Pekod, we know that there is usually water there. Therefore, his statement should not be believed. But in the case of the woman, we do not know that she was raped. There is only a concern that she might have been. Therefore, we can believe her.", "2": "Introduction<br>This section refers to the section of the mishnah which stated that if there are any witnesses at all, even a slave who is not normally allowed to testify, who can state that she was not raped, they are believed.", "3": "Even if the only person who can testify that she was not raped is her own handmaid, the handmaid is believed. This is true even though there is some concern that the handmaid would lie on behalf of her own mistress.", "4": "A baraita is cited that contradicts the idea that even a woman\u2019s own handmaid should be believed. This baraita refers to a particular situation in which a woman should not be secluded with a particular man. She can be secluded with him, as long as there is any other person present, with one exception\u2014her handmaid. The concern is that if only her handmaid is present, she might sleep with the man in the handmaid\u2019s presence and the handmaid would not tell anyone of it. Thus we see that handmaid\u2019s may not be trusted to testify against their mistresses.", "5": "There are two solutions. According to R. Papi, the rabbis were especially lenient in the case of the captive woman. In that case, even her own handmaid is believed. But in the case of seclusion, she should not be secluded with him in front of her own handmaid.<br>Papa distinguishes between her handmaid, who is not believed, and her husband\u2019s handmaid, who is believed. Her husband\u2019s handmaid will not cover up for the woman, because she is not her mistress.", "6": "The Talmud raises a difficulty on the notion that a woman\u2019s own handmaid is not believed. A person cannot testify on his own behalf. But a handmaid should be allowed to testify on behalf of her mistress.<br>The answer is that a woman\u2019s handmaid is like the woman herself. Therefore, she cannot testify on behalf of her mistress.", "7": "Ashi says that both cases (captive woman and seclusion) refer to a woman\u2019s own handmaid. The handmaid will tend to see things happen and keep quiet. Therefore, in the case of the captive woman if she sees something happen and does say something, she is believed. But in the case of seclusion, a woman should not be secluded in the presence of her own handmaid because the handmaid will keep silent.", "8": "Introduction<br>This sugya continues off from yesterday. There we said that a woman\u2019s slave is believed to testify that a woman was not raped in a city that had been taken over by a marauding army. Our sugya asks why she is believed. After all, she could be lying.", "9": "We do not assume that a maidservant would witness her mistress being raped and not only not testify as to what she saw, but actively lie about it. She might keep quiet and not testify. But she wouldn\u2019t compound the matter by also falsely testifying.", "10": "To prove that we don\u2019t assume a person would doubly lie, the Talmud cites an unrelated story. In this story a brother appears out of nowhere and wants to share an inheritance. The other brother clearly does not want to share the estate with someone he doesn\u2019t even know. R. Hisda answers that it is certainly possible that a person does not recognize his own brothers. This is known from the Joseph story.", "11": "This is the continuation of the story between R. Hisda, the inheritor and his alleged brother. At first, R. Hisda tells the person who just showed up that he must prove that he is a brother. This seems to make sense. But then the story takes a twist. The brother who just showed up says that the inheriting brother is a powerful man, and people are afraid to say something that will anger him. In turn, R. Hisda powerfully rules against this strong man. Generally, the person who wishes to extract money, i.e. the plaintiff, bears the burden of proof. But R. Hisda says that he is going to rule against all such powerful men and make them bear the burden of proof, even if they are the defendants!", "12": "The story concludes with the same remark we had above. Even if this powerful man brings witnesses, we should still fear that they will lie. The answer is that we don\u2019t fear a double lie. They won\u2019t both hide the truth (that he is a brother) and lie and actively say that he is not a brother.<br>In close, the assumption of this passage seems to be that we generally trust people when they testify in court. This is true to this day. Even though people are not automatically trusted, they are not automatically distrusted either.", "13": "Introduction<br>This sugya continues the discussion of whether a woman\u2019s own handmaid is believed to testify about her. R. Papi implied that in the case of the captive woman, even her own handmaid is believed. R.

These are the two parties that are immediately interested in the outcome. Anyone else should be allowed to testify.", "15": "1. Papi and R. Ashi both said that her handmaid is believed. They certainly cannot agree with both tannaim, for one baraita explicitly said that she is not believed. But R. Papa who said that her handmaid is not believed might be able to find a way to get the second baraita to agree with him.", "16": "Papa could answer that the baraita that implied that a woman\u2019s handmaid is believed referred to a handmaid that \u201ctalked in her simplicity,\u201d meaning she didn\u2019t actively testify. Since she did not intend to testify, we do not assume that she was lying.", "17": "The Talmud cites a case where such an event really happens. Interest, the story is told by a rabbi coming from Carthage, clearly a Roman stronghold. A son comes in front of Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] and just simply tells the story of what happened. He didn\u2019t mean to testify that his mother was not raped. He just says that he was looking after her during her captivity. Rabbi, in his wisdom, allowed her to marry a priest, based on the son\u2019s testimony. R. Papa could say that the same is true for a handmaid. If she testifies, she is not believed. But if she speaks in her simplicity, she is believed.", "18": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf begins with a new section of the earlier mishnah.", "19": "This story illustrates the principle in the above mishnah. A person cannot testify about something that they have a personal interest in. Rabbi Zechariah ben Ha-katzav has a personal interest in his wife not being assumed to have been raped. He is a priest, and if such an assumption is made, she is prohibited to him. Sadly, he is not believed. While I admit this story causes us to have great sympathy for both the rabbi and his wife, the principle does seem to be of great legal value.", "20": "Despite the fact that they could not stay married, Rabbi Zechariah wanted her to continue to act as the head of the family. She received her own little house in his courtyard, and she seems to have continued to mother the children.", "21": "Abaye now asks if one can treat one\u2019s own divorcee the same way that R. Zechariah treated his wife who was forbidden to him because she was taken captive. Was that a special leniency because of the problem of captivity? Or is that always the law\u2014can anyone live in such close proximity to one\u2019s divorcee?<br>The answer is brought from a baraita that rules much more strictly. No man may live in the same neighborhood as his ex-wife who has remarried. The fear is that they will engage in an illicit affair; after all, they do have some familiarity with each other. With a Kohen the rule is even stricter\u2014she may not live in the same alley as him, even if she was not remarried. This is because a Kohen may not have relations with his divorcee, even if she has not remarried.  Therefore, they have to live even further apart."}, "52": {"0": "The obvious follow up is\u2014who has to move? While the answer sounds sexist, it really is not. Whoever owns the property gets to stay.", "1": "A thornier question is what to do if they jointly own the courtyard. The baraita did not address this situation directly, so they have to try to figure it out from the case where it says that she moves out. If this is a case where she owns the property, the baraita is wrong\u2014if she owns the property, he moves out. And if he owns the property, it is overly obvious\u2014we already know that. Therefore, it must be a case where they jointly own the property. In such a case, the prejudice rules and she must move out.<br>The Talmud rejects this. It could refer to a case where they are renting. In such a case it would seem that they both have to move out.", "2": "Ultimately the answer is that it is more difficult for a man to move than a woman. While it is true that this is a sexist answer, it\u2019s not exactly saying that the man is \u201cbetter\u201d or more important than the woman. Rather, it is saying that the husband is in essence weaker than the wife. Moving would be more harmful to him. I\u2019m not saying this isn\u2019t sexist. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s just a bit different than we might have at first expected.", "3": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section discusses the possibility that a husband would come with his ex-wife to court, so that she could collect money from him.", "4": "According to the baraita, if she needs to collect money that her former husband borrowed from her father\u2019s estate, she may not come to court to collect from him. According to Rashi, this refers to a priest who divorced his wife. The rabbis feared that in court they might decide to reunite, and it is prohibited for a priest to be remarried with his divorcee.<br>The amoraim offer various stringencies which the court enacts if they do come into court at the same time.", "5": "The baraita that R. Nahman cites here is from a minor tractate called Evel Rabbati, which means \u201cthe bigger [tractate] dealing with the laws of mourning.\u201d Today that tractate is called \u201cSemachot\u201d\u2014celebrations\u2014which is, of course, a euphemism.<br>The baraita limits the above halakhah to a case where the couple was already married. In such a case, since they have already been familiar with each other, we fear that seeing each other in court might encourage them to get back together. But if they were only betrothed, she can collect the payments herself, because they were never familiar with each other.", "6": "There are two versions of this story. In the first, Rava does place a go-between to separate the betrothed from his former fianc\u00e9e, and the R. Adda b. Matanah says that he did not need to, and in the end, Rava justifies the need to separate the two. In the second version the actions are flipped.<br>In any case, the interesting issue is that we see that there may have been some \u201cfamiliarity\u201d between an engaged couple, even though this \u201cfamiliarity\u201d is supposed to wait until marriage.", "7": "Introduction<br>The last Mishnah of this chapter discusses in which situations a person is believed to testify about things he saw when he was a minor. That is to say, although minors are not allowed to testify, there are certain things that a minor can see about which he may testify upon reaching adulthood.", "8": "<b>Section one:</b>  A person is believed to say that the signature on a document is similar to the handwriting of a person with whom they were close in childhood.  The assumption is that a person would remember this well.  Furthermore, this is not really \u201ctestifying\u201d but just verifying someone else\u2019s testimony, and therefore there is more room to be lenient in accepting such testimony.<br><b>Section two:</b>  A person is believed to say that he was at a wedding and the bride wore the signs of a virgin (see mishnah one of this chapter).  The Talmud explains that he is believed because most marriages are first marriages.<br><b>Section three:</b>  A priest must immerse before he eats terumah.  The time of immersion is right before evening.  A person is believed to say that he saw one of his classmates leave school early to immerse in the mikveh, and that hence he is a priest.<br><b>Section four:</b>  The priests collect their terumah at the threshing floor.  By this person testifying that so-and-so collected terumah, he is saying that he is a priest.  Note that again the mishnah is concerned with verifying the status of priests.<br><b>Section five:</b>  A bet ha-peras is a field adjacent to a field that used to serve as a cemetery but has been plowed over.   The adjacent field may have small pieces of bones there, and therefore a priest may not enter.  A person is believed to identify such a field, even if he only saw it in his childhood.<br><b>Section six:</b>  On Shabbat a person may leave his town only 2000 amot.  This is called the \u201ctehum shabbat\u201d or shabbat limit.  A person is believed when he reaches majority age to say that when they were children they would go this far out of the city.  The reason he is believed is that this is a matter that can be verified.<br><b>Section seven:</b>  The mishnah lists two things a person cannot testify that he saw as a minor.  First of all he may not testify that a certain person owned a path through someone else\u2019s field.  Second of all, he may not testify that a person owned a place where they used to stand and give eulogies.  Such places were owned on the paths that lead from the cemeteries to the cities.  It would have been like a small, private funeral home. In both of these cases, the testimony involves the ownership of land.  For a person to prove that he owns a piece of land, he will need to bring firmer testimony than this.", "9": "The first clause in the mishnah teaches that a boy can identify the handwriting of his father, teacher or brother. R. Huna b. Joshua adds that another adult must testify with him.", "10": "The Talmud answers the question of why the mishnah needs to teach all three examples. If it had taught just \u201cfather\u201d I might have thought that the son can identify the testimony of his father because he is with him so frequently. So I would not have been able to derive \u201cteacher\u201d from \u201cfather.\u201d And if it had just taught \u201cteacher\u201d I might have thought that he was believed about his teacher, because he fears his teacher. But he doesn't fear his father so much, so if the Mishnah had not taught that he is believed about his father\u2019s signature, I would not have derived it from there.", "11": "The brother is neither with the father all of the time (?) nor does a brother fear his brother (this strikes me as true). Therefore, brother needs to be taught explicitly\u2014he is believed to testify to the signature of his brother.<br>In the end the Talmud says that since the very need to uphold a document is only of rabbinic origin, the rabbis can suspend the usual laws of testimony and let people testify who normally are not allowed to do so.", "12": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now begins to go through the cases mentioned in the mishnah we learned yesterday.", "13": "He is believed to say that a particular woman was married with signs that she was a virgin because most marriages are first marriages. So his testimony is only, in a sense, aiding in proving that which we already can assume.", "14": "The mishnah said that he could testify that he remembers that a certain boy would leave school early to eat terumah, i.e. he is a Kohen. But maybe this boy is not a Kohen, but was only the slave of a Kohen. The fact that we are not concerned with the possibility that his classmate is a Kohen supports R. Joshua b. Levi\u2019s statement that it is prohibited to teach a slave Torah. [I do seem to remember echoes of this in the history of American slavery. Owners feared what would happen if there slaves became educated].", "15": "A baraita is cited as a difficulty on R. Joshua b. Levi. The baraita teaches that a slave who performs an act that seems to imply that he is free, is still not free. One of these acts is to read three verses from the Torah in the synagogue. It seems that a slave is allowed to learn Torah!"}, "53": {"0": "The resolution is that the baraita refers to a case where a slave happened to learn how to read and read in the synagogue. But R. Joshua b. Levi referred to systematically teaching one\u2019s slave to read, as if he was one\u2019s own son. ", "1": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to interpret the various sections of the Mishnah.", "2": "The Mishnah ruled that a person can testify that when he was young he would see his friend taken out of school to eat terumah and that this would be sufficient to allow that person to eat terumah. But the Talmud limits this to rabbinical terumah, whose status is lower than that of terumah mandated by the Torah. The rules for \u201ctoraitic terumah\u201d would be more significant.", "3": "The Mishnah said that the person is believed to say that someone he knew when younger used to take a share of terumah at the threshing floor. The problem is that the receiver may have been a slave of a priest. A slave may eat terumah, but if he is freed, he will not be allowed to eat terumah. The resolution is that this Mishnah follows the sage who says that one does not give terumah to the slave of a priest on the threshing floor. The reason is that if the slave is seen receiving terumah, people might think he is a priest and raise him to the full status of a priest, and allow him to marry a woman who one marries a priest. This is the opinion of R. Judah. R. Yose holds that the slave may receive terumah at the threshing floor, but does have to acknowledge there that he may be a slave. R. Yose correspondingly holds that the fact that the slave received terumah at the threshing floor is not sufficient evidence that he is a priest.", "4": "This baraita demonstrates the danger of giving testimony, even when one believes that one is telling the truth. R. Elazar testified only once in his entire life and it almost led to a serious error. As the end of the story explains, he was in the place of R. Yose where they give terumah to slaves at the threshing floor. But R. Elazar then went to R. Judah\u2019s place where they don\u2019t give terumah to slaves. He testified that he had seen this person receiving terumah and the court assumed that the fact that he received terumah meant that he was not a slave.<br>This story may also be a tacit argument against halakhic diversity. Such diversity can lead to confusion.<br>The story is interrupted by the editor ruling out the very possibility that the slave was elevated to the priesthood. In a famous story about R. Pinchas ben Yair, we learn God does not allow even the animals of the pious to stumble, all the more so God would not allow the pious themselves to stumble. Therefore, what really happened was that they wanted to elevate the slave to the priesthood. They did not actually do so.", "5": "The mishnah rules a person may testify that a certain field is a \u201cbet haperas.\u201d If one plows over a grave, he makes the surrounding area into a \u201cbet haperas,\u201d for bones may have been strewn there. One is allowed to testify about it because its status is only \u201cderabanan,\u201d of rabbinic origin. We can see this in the statement of Rav. Rav rules that if a priest wants to walk in such a field, all he has to do is blow away the dust. If the status of the field was toraitic, he would not have been so easily able to remedy it.", "6": "Rav Judah rules that if a bet haperas was trodden by many, many people or animals walking there, all the bones there were probably trampled on and are now smaller than the size of a barleycorn. Such a small piece of bone no longer transmits impurity.", "7": "On Shabbat a person may go only 2000 amot out of one\u2019s town. This is called the \u201ctehum shabbat\u201d or shabbat limit.  A person is believed when he reaches majority age to say that when they were children they would go this far out of the city.<br>The Talmud comments that the author of this Mishnah holds that the entire prohibition is only \u201cderabanan\u201d and therefore the rules can be made lenient when it comes to determining where this limit actually lies.", "8": "Introduction<br>This is the last section of this chapter.", "9": "A person is not believed to testify that a certain piece of land belonged to another person, either that he had a path there or that he had a place to give eulogies there. The reason is that such testimony is not sufficient to take money from one person and give it to another. In order for property to be transferred, the testimony would have to originate with one who saw the events as an adult.", "10": "The baraita adds more cases where a person is believed as an adult to testify concerning things he knew as a boy.<br>He is believed to testify that a certain family was \u201cfit\u201d or \u201cunfit.\u201d This refers to being fit to marry an Israelite\u2014i.e. the family does not consist of mamzerim. The original term that the Talmud uses is \u201cpure or impure\u201d but the Talmud prefers the terms \u201cfit or unfit.\u201d<br>The Talmud will explain below what a  \u201cketzatzah.\u201d<br>He is believed only if he himself saw these things as a child. He is not believed if he only knows of them through hearsay.<br>Finally, he must have been a Jew when he found these things out. If he was a non-Jew or a slave and then was freed, he is not believed.<br>These last two rules accord with normal Talmudic rules of testimony.

The Talmud will now examine his opinion carefully.", "12": "Yohanan ben Beroka cannot disagree with the clause that refers to the path or the eulogy place. To cause a transfer of land would always require full testimony. Rather, he must disagree with the earlier clause, according to which if a person witnessed one of these things as a non-Jewish or slave child, he may not testify about them as an adult. R. Yohanan b. Beroka says that he may testify in such a situation.", "13": "The first opinion in the Mishnah holds that since he was not a Jew when he saw the events occurred, he would not have paid careful attention. He would have known that as a non-Jew, these issues were not relevant. R. Yohanan b. Beroka assumes that he was going to convert shortly, and so he would have paid attention.", "14": "The \u201cketzatzah\u201d ceremony was basically a way of letting everyone know that a certain person had married a woman not fit for him, and that therefore people should stay away from his offspring. As we have seen, lineage was a very, very important criterion in choosing a marriage partner for Jews living in this period. Indeed, until the modern period, lineage was probably one of the two most important determining factors in marital choice (the other would have been wealth). The ceremony was clearly meant to discourage men from marrying women unfit for them. I should note that the notion that marriage is meant for personal fulfillment and that choice of partner should be based first and foremost on love is a notion that is accepted by most people today, but that would have been strange in the ancient world. It is a modern notion that arose within the last several hundred years.", "15": "Congratulations! You have finished the second chapter of Ketubot. There were many important legal principles in this chapter, including \u201cthe mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits,\u201d \u201cWhy would she have lied,\u201d \u201cmigo,\u201d and \u201cthe fear of collusion.\u201d These principles have far-reaching implications, well beyond the topics discussed here."}, "54": {"0": "Introduction<br>Deuteronomy 22:28-29 states, \u201cIf a man comes upon a young girl, a virgin who is not engaged and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered, the man who lay with her shall pay the girl\u2019s father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife.  Because he has violated her, he can never have the right to divorce her.\u201d There are similar verses in Exodus 22:15-16.<br>The rabbis learn from these verses that if a man rapes a virgin he must pay her father a fine of 50 shekels, which is the equivalent of 200 dinars.  Furthermore, he must marry her. Through a careful reading of the wording of these laws the rabbis concluded that this rule applies only to a virgin (betulah) who is also young (na\u2019arah), which means any girl who has reached the age of 12 and has shown signs of pubery.  A girl remains in this status for only six months.  After that she is considered to have reached adulthood and one who rapes her does not pay the fine.<br>Before we proceed, we should remember that the fine was only one payment made by the rapist to his victim.  He also had to pay all of the damages that one pays for injuring another person.  We should also remember that society\u2019s attitude towards rape has changed drastically in the last century. Rape is a horrible crime and while we are discussing the technical aspects of who receives a fine and who doesn\u2019t, we shouldn\u2019t forget what we are talking about.<br>The mishnah teaches that a man must pay the fine to a woman even if he is not allowed to marry her.<br>Another note about the beginning of this chapter. This mishnah relates to a principle that appears elsewhere in the Mishnah\u2014if a person commits a crime for which he is obligated two penalties, he only gets the worse of the two penalties. In today\u2019s mishnah the man violates a woman who is forbidden to him but the penalty for sex with her is karet (a penalty not carried out by the courty), or is a simple prohibition with no penalty. In this case, as we shall learn, he incurs both the financial penalty and karet. Had the sexual crime been one punishable by death, he would not be liable for the financial penalty, because in that case he receives only one penalty.", "1": "<b>Section one:</b>  The women in this section are forbidden in marriage to an Israelite.  Our mishnah teaches that although they are forbidden in marriage, he still must pay them the fine.  A mamzeret was defined in Yevamot 4:9.  A netinah is a descendent of Temple slaves.  The Samaritans were considered a splinter group by the rabbis and Jews were forbidden from marrying them.<br><b>Section two:</b>  It is assumed that a non-Jewish woman is not a virgin.  Captives are assumed to have been raped and slave-women are also assumed to be non-virgins.  Furthermore, as we have learned before, the rabbis thought that if a woman lost her virginity before the age of three years and one day, her physical signs would later return.  Therefore if these women made the passage into being full, free Jews or were redeemed from captivity before the age of three, they are assumed to have returned to being virgins.  Therefore, they receive the fine.<br><b>Section three:</b>  The women listed in this section are forbidden to a man, and having relationship with them is punishable by karet (a punishment inflicted by God and not by the court).  Since the court does not execute the man for having had intercourse with these women, he is liable to pay the fine.<br>Note that in order for him to be liable to pay the fine, these women cannot be married nor have been married.  The only situation that he will be liable to pay the fine for having intercourse with one of these women is if they were betrothed to one of these men and then divorced or widowed before proper marriage.  Had they been married when he raped them, he would be liable for the death penalty for having committed adultery.  Had they been fully married and then divorced or widowed, they would not be considered virgins, and hence he would not be liable to pay the fine.", "2": "The Talmud merely clarifies the intent of the Mishnah is to list the women who receive a fine despite the fact that they were prohibited to the man. It did not mean to say that if a man rapes or seduces a woman permitted to him, he does not pay a fine.", "3": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section deals with the question of the age of a girl that receives the fine for being raped or seduced.<br>As an introduction, I want to make a few comments. These sections are highly, highly theoretical. The rabbis in this chapter are basically trying to interpret the Torah\u2019s laws in a coherent manner, but they are not referring to practical halakhah observed in their day, or perhaps halakhah that was ever observed. These halakhot try to make exegetical sense of the Torah, but I do not believe they are trying to ask the question of \u201cwhat is fair.\u201d For instance, the rabbis place severe limits on the age of the girl whose rapist/seducer is liable for the fine. This does not mean that they thought it was okay to rape girls of another age. They certainly did not. They just work out the exegesis of the Torah such as to say that only a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d receives a fine. The rabbis did not live in a world in which Jewish men were allowed to sell their daughters into slavery. This is clear from other sections of the Talmud. Nevertheless, the laws of slavery are part of the Torah, and therefore are worthy of discussion. I really can\u2019t emphasize this enough. These are theoretical laws and the arguments are theoretical.<br>We would do well to remember the general ages of the girl:<br>Ketanah (small girl)\u2014from birth to puberty.<br>Na\u2019arah (young girl)\u2014from the onset of puberty till maturity.<br>Bogeret (mature girl)\u2014having reached sexual maturity.<br>Elsewhere, years are used instead of physical signs.", "4": "The Mishnah says that if the girl was a \u201cyoung girl\u201d she receives a fine. \u201cYoung girl\u201d in rabbinic literature refers to a girl from the age of 12-12 \u00bd. The implication is that a minor girl does not receive a fine. The Talmud will now explore who holds this opinion....", "5": "There are two laws referred to here. The first is the issue of receiving a fine for being raped or seduced. The second is the legal ability of a father to sell his daughter into slavery. According to Rabbi Meir, a father can sell only his minor daughter into slavery. Once she hits puberty, he may no longer do so. And at that point, she receives the fine. These laws do not coincide at all.<br>According to the rabbis, a girl can receive a fine from the age of three until she becomes mature (bogeret). The disagreement is over whether a ketanah (a small girl) receives a fine. According to R. Meir she does not, but according to the other rabbis, she does.", "6": "The rabbis agree that a small girl can be sold. They do not mean to say that she only receives the fine. All they mean to say is that the two halakhot can coincide."}, "55": {"0": "Introduction<br>The Mishnah listed women who receive a fine even though they were legally forbidden to him. The Talmud is perplexed by this.", "1": "The Torah says that if a man rapes a woman, he must marry her as a wife (providing she agrees). But if she is prohibited to him as a wife, then how can he marry her. And if she is prohibited, then this whole passage is not applicable to her. So how can the Mishnah say that he still pays a fine the fine.", "2": "The word \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d is written twice in the passage about rape (Deuteronomy 22:28-29), and on one of those occasions it has a \u201cheh\u201d\u2014the word \u201cthe\u201d\u2014preceding it. This allows Resh Lakish to read it three times. The first time he reads it as necessary to teach the law itself\u2014the fine relates to the na\u2019arah, the young girl. The second time it comes to include women prohibited to him by a negative commandment. This would include the mamzeret, netinah and a few other categories of women. The third time would include women prohibited to him by \u201ckaret,\u201d which would include certain incestual relationships, such as sister, brother\u2019s wife, and wife\u2019s sister. The fine applies to these women as well.", "3": "Papa offers a very similar set-up to Resh Lakish\u2019s midrash, but uses a different prooftext, Exodus 22:15-16.", "4": "The Talmud now asks the typical question\u2014why do the rabbis use different verses? The answer will be that each rabbi uses the other\u2019s verse for another midrash.<br>Papa uses the verse that was the base of Resh Lakish\u2019s derashah for a derashah that is ascribed to Abaye. Abaye reads the verse as saying that if the girl dies before the seducer/rapist pays the fine, the seducer/rapist does not pay the fine. Again, I should note that this is not a midrash meant to make life easier for an actual seducer/rapist. It is tied to legal/midrashic concepts. For instance, if someone dies before the case comes to trial (in this case the girl), the trial cannot really happen. But again, to reiterate, it is highly theoretical in their world.", "5": "Resh Lakish used the verse used by R. Papa for the midrash that teaches that the fine levied on the rapist/seducer should be the same as the general bride-price for virgins. Deuteronomy determines that this mohar is 50 shekels. The rabbis read the biblical shekel as equivalent to four Roman dinars. This is the source of the 200 dinar (or Aramaic zuz) ketubah for a woman\u2019s first marriage.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to discuss the dispute between Resh Lakish and R. Papa that appeared in yesterday\u2019s section.", "7": "The problem with yesterday\u2019s section is that it creates the picture that Resh Lakish would disagree with Abaye or that R. Papa would disagree with the gezerah shavah, which equated the fine with the general bride price for virgins. But this is not true\u2014all agree with both of those other derashot. In fact, there really have not been any actual disputes as of now.", "8": "The Talmud creates harmony by saying that ultimately there are enough words to go around for everyone. It in essence combines Resh Lakish\u2019s and Rav Papa\u2019s derashot into one system. This allows two of the words to teach the law itself, two to each Abaye and the gezerah shavah, and it still leaves two more words, one to teach that fines apply to women who are prohibited to the rapist/seducer by a negative commandment and to those punishable by karet.", "9": "In the baraita cited here, two tannaim (with similar names) limit the applicability of the law in Deuteronomy 22:28-29 to a woman who is legally allowed to marry the man. This opposes the mishnah here in Ketubot according to which even if the marriage is not possible, he still pays the fine.", "10": "The two R. Shimons seem to say almost the same thing, so the Talmud strives to find a difference between them. The difference is with regard to a woman prohibited by a negative commandment to a man, but who nevertheless can be married. An Israelite man can betroth a mamzeret or netinah (similar laws to the mamzeret) but they may not stay married. He would be obligated to divorce her. In contrast, a man could not betroth someone prohibited by incest, such as his sister, daughter or mother. Even if they perform a betrothal, they are not betrothed.<br>So according to R. Shimon the Yemenite, since the man can betroth the mamzeret, i.e. she can become his wife, the fine applies in that case. But according to R. Shimon ben Menasya, since she cannot stay his wife, the laws do not apply. Note they would both agree that if the marriage was incestual, the fine would not apply. This opposes our mishnah.", "11": "Akiva holds (unlike most sages) that there can be no betrothal even if the prohibition of the union is only a negative commandment.

If so, what is the difference between them?", "12": "According to R. Simai, and with him R. Akiba, the only negative commandment where the offspring is not a mamzer is the offspring of a widow and a high priest. In all other cases, R. Akiba would say two things: 1) The offspring is a mamzer; 2) There can be no betrothal between the man and woman. So to connect this to our issue\u2014R. Shimon the Yemenite and R. Shimon ben Menasya would disagree only if the rapist is the high priest and the woman is a widow. In all other cases, since there could be no betrothal, there is no fine, or any of the other laws in Deuteronomy 29:28-29. This would disagree even more radically with our mishnah.", "13": "Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion from yesterday.", "14": "According to R. Yeshebav R.

Shimon ben Menasya from the baraita we learned yesterday.<br>I should also note that we can see in this statement the strong resistance some rabbis must have had to R. Akiba\u2019s stringency.

Why legislate halakhah such that even more are created?"}, "56": {"0": "The two R. Shimons would disagree if the prohibition is one that stems from a positive commandment.

R. Shimon the Yemenite would say the fine applies. But he would have to divorce her, so according to R. Shimon ben Menasya, the fine would not apply.

Akiba rules that the offspring is a mamzer even in the case of a widow to a high priest but not in the case of a positive commandment. But maybe R. Yeshebav was saying his own opinion, in which case he might have meant to say that R. Akiba says the child is a mamzer even if the marriage is only a transgression of a positive commandment, such as in the case of an Egyptian or Edomite woman. If this is so, then what could possibly be a case where a woman could be married to a man (the betrothal is valid) but she could not stay married to him, such that the two R. Shimons would argue?", "2": "A high priest must marry a virgin. This is a positive commandment. But this rule does not apply to all, only to a high priest. Therefore, R. Akiba would agree that the offspring is not a mamzer.", "3": "Introduction<br>This section opens a long discussion about an issue referred to in the Mishnah that opened this chapter. If a man commits a crime which would obligate him for two penalties, he would only get the worse of the two. Thus in the Mishnah, if he rapes or seduces a woman and thereby incurs a fine, and at the same time he is obligated for the death penalty, he gets the death penalty and does not pay the fine. The Talmud will now explore the parameters of this concept and its source.", "4": "According to R. Hisda, all tannaim found on the previous page agree that if a man rapes or seduces a woman who is a menstruant he pays the fine even though she was prohibited to him. This is because she is permitted to him as a wife and she can remain his wife. In other words, this is different than prohibitions that remain in place, such as incest, a widow to the high priest or the positive commandment prohibitions of not marrying an Edomite or Egyptian.", "5": "The Mishnah had distinguished between sexual prohibitions punishable by death and those punishable by karet (extirpation, a punishment not meted out by the court). If the woman was prohibited by death, the rapist/seducer dies and does not pay the fine. But if she was prohibited by karet, the rapist/seducer is punished by karet and pays the fine. This is the case with many incest prohibitions such as sister or sister-in-law. In other words, the rule that he gets the worse of the two punishments only applies when one of those punishments is death. If one is karet, then one still pays the fine.<br>Rabbi Nehuniah ben Hakaneh disagrees. He holds that if one incurs the penalty of karet and a fine at the same time, he gets karet and not the fine. This is illustrated by Yom Kippur, whose transgression is punishable by karet and not death, as is Shabbat. Rabbi Nehuniah ben Hakaneh says that Shabbat and Yom Kippur work the same\u2014if one transgresses Yom Kippur by doing something for which he is also obligated to pay a fine, he is exempt from the fine because he is punished with karet.<br>Note that this would also disagree with R. Hisda above. The penalty for sex with a menstruant is karet. So according to R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh if a man rapes/seduces a menstruant, he does not pay the fine because he gets karet.", "6": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now inquires as to the reasoning of R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh who said that one who performs a single action for which he is simultaneously liable for karet and a financial penalty does not pay the fine. To understand this passage we need to understand the source of the idea that if one gets the death penalty and a fine, he only gets the death penalty. This comes from Exodus 21:22. If a man strikes a pregnant woman and she does not die (no \u201charm\u201d or \u201cason\u201d occurs) then he pays for the fact that he caused her to miscarry. But if she does die, the implication is that he does not pay. This is the source of the idea that a person receives the worse of the two punishments.", "7": "As I said in the introduction, the basis of the whole idea that one does not incur two penalties for one crime comes from Exodus 21:22. This verse refers to death (harm) inflicted by a human. The same word \u201cason\u201d is used in Genesis 42:38, where Jacob expresses concern that if Benjamin goes down to Egypt with his brothers, \u201charm\u201d will occur to him. Abaye reads this \u201charm\u201d as referring to death by the hand of heaven. This leads Abaye to conclude that R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh equated death by a man (execution) with death by the hand of heaven (karet). Just as one cannot be liable for execution and a fine for one crime, so too one cannot be liable for karet and a fine for one crime.", "8": "Abaye assumed that Jacob used the word \u201charm (ason)\u201d to refer to harm by the hands of heaven. But how do we know this was what he was warning them about. Perhaps he was warning them about other forms of harm that could be the responsibility of man\u2014such as lions or thieves. If so, then we have no proof that \u201charm\u201d could refer to harm at the hands of heaven.<br>The answer is that Jacob was warning his sons about any type of harm, both that from heaven and that from man.<br>Below the Talmud will ask if \u201clions and thieves\u201d really are \u201cfrom the hands of man.\u201d", "9": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section we learned that God controls heat and cold and that lions and thieves are in the hands of man. Today\u2019s section questions both of these assumptions.", "10": "The verse in Proverbs seems to prove that a person has control over cold and heat for one who acts well will not be punished with them. I should note that this is Rashi\u2019s understanding of the words I have translated at \u201ccold and heat.\u201d Biblical translations render them as \u201cthorns and snares.\u201d", "11": "The Talmud also questions the proposition that \u201clions and thieves\u201d are \u201cby the hands of man.\u201d A tradition concerning the cessation of the four forms of capital punishment is cited to point out that God sends lions to kill someone who should have been stoned, or thieves to kill someone who should have been decapitated. This proves that lions and thieves are \u201cby the hands of God.\u201d"}, "57": {"0": "The Talmud solves the problem by simply reversing the tradition, which is by the hands of man and which is by the hands of heaven.<br>I should note that the way that the Gemara so easily reverses this tradition might a hint that we just don\u2019t know what is \u201cby the hand of heaven\u201d and what is \u201cby the hand of man.\u201d Sometimes what we perceive to be the apparent truth, the immediate cause, is not really the ultimate cause. And in essence, here the Talmud is saying that ultimately there is no difference. What is \u201cby the hand of man\u201d really means that man causes the bad thing to happen, either directly, or by deserving it through his deeds.

One is exempt only if the punishment is karet and a fine, but not death at the hands of heaven and a fine. In contrast, Abaye derives the reasoning of R. Nehuniah from a verse referring to death at the hands of heaven. Therefore, one who incurs death at the hands of heaven and a fine at the same time is exempt from the fine. This would include, so it seems, a non-priest who eats terumah.", "5": "The Talmud raises a difficulty on Abaye, by citing a teaching of R. Hisda. R. Hisda notes that if the act can be separated into two sins, the person is liable for both. This would be true of someone who steals forbidden fat and then eats it. He is liable for stealing the moment he lifts the fat up, but he is not liable for karet until he eats it.<br>This should then be true of terumah as well. As soon as he lifts it up, he is liable for illegal appropriation of terumah, which is punishable by a monetary fine. But he only becomes liable for the death penalty once he eats it.", "6": "The Talmud now locates a case where both sins do come simultaneously\u2014someone else picked it up and shoved it in his mouth. In this case his misappropriation of it and his eating of it are simultaneous.

The idea there was that if an action for which there are two transgressions can be divided into two distinct actions, each of which incurs a different punishment, he gets both punishments. We would not say in that case that he only gets the worse of the two. Yesterday the section ended with the resolution that if someone put the terumah into his mouth, then both sins would have come simultaneously\u2014stealing and a non-priest eating terumah. Today\u2019s section questions this.", "8": "The Talmud pushes the idea of separating one act into two even further. Here they suggest that when he chews the terumah, he acquires it. This is the act of stealing, for which he would be liable for a financial penalty. Once he swallows it, he is liable for eating the terumah and would get \u201cdeath by the hands of heaven.\u201d So we still do not have a case in which someone is exempt for a fine when eating terumah.<br>The answer is that someone else shoved the terumah straight into his esophagus. Yes, this barely seems possible. But it seems to momentarily satisfy the Talmud\u2019s need to resolve everything.", "9": "The question now is why should he be obligated at all if someone else shoved terumah down his throat.

In such a case he is liable for benefiting from it, but not for stealing it.", "10": "These two amoraim offer new resolutions. Rav Papa suggests that it was liquid terumah. With no chewing, he is liable only when he swallows. So stealing and benefiting from terumah are simultaneous.<br>Ashi offers a resolution that is in a completely new direction. The person does two discreet acts at the same time, for one he is liable for death (at the hands of heaven) and for the other he is liable for a financial penalty. R. Ashi seems to be unique in saying that in such a situation he only gets the worse of the two punishments, even though the two acts have nothing whatsoever to do with each other.

The question continues to be\u2014what constitutes a single act such that one would only receive one punishment.

Abin, he is exempt from the payment because in order to put the arrow down, the final act that makes him liable, he had to pick it up. So too would be the case in the case where he stole the fat and then ate it. He had to pick up the food in order to eat it. Nevertheless, R. Hisda says that he is liable for the stealing. This might imply that R. Hisda and R. Abin disagree.", "3": "The Talmud now draws some distinctions between the two situations. With the arrow, it is impossible for it to travel four cubits in the public domain without being first uprooted. Therefore it is considered one act. But one could eat the forbidden fat without first picking it up. Therefore, the picking up is not essential to the transgression and can be treated as a separate act for which he is liable.", "4": "The other difference is that once the arrow has been shot, it cannot be taken back. This means uprooting and landing are part of the same action. But even after the fat has been picked up, it need not be eaten. Therefore they are two distinct actions.", "5": "The Talmud now points out the practical difference between the two answers above. The case is one who carries a knife in the public domain on Shabbat and tears silk on the way. The knife could not have been put down after traveling four cubits if it had not been picked up at the beginning of four cubits. Therefore, it could be considered one act. But it is not an action that cannot be taken back. One could walk two cubits, tear the silk and then not walk the next two cubits. Therefore it could be considered from a different perspective two acts.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section goes back to discussing the case of the arrow shot through the public domain on Shabbat that also tears silk on its way.", "7": "This is the statement we saw above\u2014since he couldn\u2019t have transgressed Shabbat without uprooting the arrow (i.e. shooting it), we consider the shooting from beginning to end to be all one action, from the throwing until the landing. And since the silk was torn during this action, he can only be made liable for one punishment, in this case death. He is exempt from the fine.", "8": "Bibi b. Abaye raises a difficulty on R. Abin from a baraita. According to the baraita, if he picks up a purse and carries it from one domain to the other, he is liable to pay the penalty for stealing because first he became liable for stealing and then he carried it. These are two separate actions and he is liable therefore for both of them.<br>But if he dragged the purse out into the public domain he is not liable for the fine because the Shabbat transgression and stealing happened simultaneously, as soon as he took the purse out of the private domain.<br>But if we invoke the principle from before, then he should be exempt in the first case as well. The lifting is necessary for the carrying out. So why should he be liable. This is the difficulty on R. Abin.", "9": "The Talmud limits the case in which he is liable for the fine. When he lifted it up he was intending to hide it in the private domain and not take it out. At that point he became obligated for stealing. Then he changed his mind and took it out of the house. At that point he is liable for carrying (this will be modified below, but for now, this is what the Talmud says). But if he had picked it up with the intent of carrying it out in the first place, he would have been exempt from the fine because we would consider this one act.", "10": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section the Talmud limited the case where one is liable for the fine and for the greater punishment to a case where he picked the purse up in order to hide it and then took it out into the public domain. In such a case he is first liable for the fine, and then he becomes liable for the Shabbat transgression of carrying. Our section asks if he is really liable for the Shabbat transgression if he picked it up without intending to carry it out.", "11": "As an objection the Talmud cites a statement by R. Yohanan that if one intends to perform an action that would not make him liable for Shabbat and begins to do that action, and then changes his mind and performs an action that would make him liable for Shabbat, he is exempt. The person here intended to carry within the private domain, which is permitted, and then took something out to the public domain, forbidden. To be liable the entire action must be performed with the intent of transgressing Shabbat. Therefore, if he picked the purse up with the intent of not taking it out of the private domain and then he did take it out he has not even transgressed Shabbat.", "12": "The Talmud now offers a different case where the stealing precedes the Shabbat transgression. The man picks up the purse in the private domain with the intent of stealing it and taking it out to the public domain. He is now liable for stealing. Then he starts to carry it out but stops before he puts it down in the public domain. This detaches the initial lifting up from the putting down. Therefore, these are considered two acts and he is liable for stealing and for transgressing Shabbat.", "13": "The Talmud now explains why he stood. If he stood for a second to adjust the weight on his shoulders, then since this is the usual way of carrying, it would still be considered one action and the liability for Shabbat would come at the same time as the liability for stealing. Therefore he must have stood in order to rest."}, "59": {"0": "<br>Introduction<br>The Talmud continues the discussion of when someone is liable for both stealing and transgressing Shabbat by carrying into the public domain. Yesterday we learned that if he picks up the object and walks out into the public domain we can consider it two actions because walking is like standing.", "1": "The Talmud accepts that the previous solution and now offers a new one. Why does the baraita say that he is liable for the fine and the Shabbat transgression? Because it holds like Ben Azzai who says that one who walks is like one who stands. Each step he takes is considered like a new step. Therefore, from the moment he lifts up the object he has acquired it and become liable for stealing. He is not liable for the Shabbat transgression until he steps over the boundary and goes into the public domain. This allows us to consider the action to be two actions and not one.", "2": "The answer is that the baraita needed to teach the case of dragging the purse out to let us know that this is considered carrying something out into the public domain on Shabbat and is a transgression. We might have thought that to be liable for carrying the person would have to actually pick the object up.", "3": "The next question is what size of a purse was he dragging out? If it was too big to be carried, then dragging it out is the normal way of carrying such a purse and it is obvious that he is liable. And if it is small, then he really shouldn\u2019t be liable because dragging out a small purse is an abnormal action, and one is never liable for Shabbat transgressions when the action is done in an abnormal way. Rather, it must have been a medium sized purse, one that could be carried with some difficulty but would also be dragged. Picture something like a pretty heavy suitcase.", "4": "The question now becomes where was he dragging it to? If he dragged it into the public domain, the Talmud believes that he is exempt from stealing because he has not yet even acquired the object. But if he drags it into a private domain, he has not transgressed Shabbat, at least not toraitically, because according to the rabbis the Torah prohibits only carrying from the private domain into a public domain.<br>The answer is that he drags it into the sides of the public domain. By doing so he has acquired the object, because this area is divided off from the public domain. But it still counts as the public domain such that he is obligated for carrying/dragging something there from the private domain.", "5": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section the Talmud limited the baraita to a case where he dragged the purse out to the sides of the public domain. In this way he has transgressed Shabbat and he has also acquired the purse such that he would be liable to pay the fine. In other words, the sides of the public domain count as the public domain for the Shabbat laws but not with regard to the laws of stealing. Today\u2019s section explores whose opinion this is.", "6": "There is a dispute between R. Eliezer and the rabbis about the status of the sides of the public road (or domain). R. Eliezer says they count as the public road and the other rabbis say that they do not. But our baraita, as we understood it above, matches neither of those opinions, because as I stated above, the baraita considers the sides to be like the public domain for matters of Shabbat but not for stealing. So whose opinion does this baraita match?", "7": "The baraita does indeed accord with R. Eliezer. R. Eliezer holds that with regard to the Shabbat laws, the sides of the public domain have the status of the public domain. The reason is that sometimes the public thoroughfare becomes crowded and people use the sides. Since it does at times serve the public, it counts as the public domain. But since the public is not often there, it counts as a private domain in that one can acquire something there. Therefore, the robber of the purse who drags the purse to the sides of the public domain has transgressed Shabbat and acquired the object.", "8": "Ashi offers a different solution as to how one could be simultaneously liable for stealing and transgress Shabbat. The baraita did not refer to someone who dragged the object to the sides of the public road. Rather it refers to a case where the person lowered his hand and put the object into it in the public domain. This is true even though his hand is close to the ground and he has not therefore picked it up (if he picks it up, then he is acquiring it in a separate act). When he puts the object into his hand, he acquires it since his hand is considered a separate domain. Now the Shabbat transgression and the stealing occur simultaneously, such that he is liable only for the worse of the two punishments.", "9": "<br>Introduction<br>The last section of this daf continues to discuss the baraita about one who stole a purse by dragging it out into the public domain on Shabbat.", "10": "Aha is a late amoraic sage.

He dragged it out into the public domain. Unlike, R. Aha, Ravina holds that one can acquire things in the public domain, and therefore, he need not limit the case to one where he put the object directly into his hand when it was only three handbreadths from the ground.", "11": "The Talmud now seeks the source for the debate between R. Aha and Ravina over whether one can acquire the object in the public domain (without picking it up). The debate is over a deduction made from a mishnah in Bava Kamma. The mishnah describes a thief stealing from a person\u2019s private domain. If the thief is pulling it out but the animal dies before he takes it out, the thief is exempt because he has not yet acquired the animal. But if he lifts it up in the owner\u2019s domain or if he takes it out of the domain and then it dies, he is liable in both cases because he acquired the animal before it died.", "12": "According to Ravina the reason he is exempt is that he did not take the animal out of the owner\u2019s domain. Had he taken it out of the owner\u2019s domain he would have been liable, even if he took it into the public domain. Hence, one can acquire in the public domain.", "13": "Aha derives from the second clause that in order to acquire the object and be liable for stealing he must take it into his own domain. Just as when he lifts it up it goes into his domain, so too when he takes it out, he must bring it into his domain and not the public domain. He would have to pick the animal (or object) up in order to acquire it.", "14": "The Talmud now turns things around and raises a difficulty for both amoraim from the clause of the mishnah that supported the opposite position.<br>Aha holds that one does not acquire in the public domain. He would say that it is still considered to be in the owner\u2019s property until the thief brings it into his property. If he brings it into the public domain, he is still liable.<br>Ravina would simply say that bringing out is not the same as lifting up. He is liable when he brings the object out of the owner\u2019s domain, even if he does not yet bring it into his own domain (by lifting it up). In other words, he is liable when he brings it into the public domain.", "15": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf continues with the next section of the Mishnah, but the topic of discussion is similar to the previous topic.

Elsewhere we will learn that a man who commits this crime is lashed (this is the human punishment for people liable for karet, the punishment for sex with sister, father\u2019s sister etc.). The problem is that we have a principle that one gets the worse of two punishments.", "16": "The mishnah here in Ketubot says that he pays the fine for sleeping with his sister, etc. But the mishnah in Makkot says that he is lashed.

There are also other damage payments, mostly similar to those relevant to cases of personal injury. So even if she is a mature girl, he still has to pay shame and damage.

According to the Talmud, she is not capable of embarrassment, nor does she really suffer \u201cdamage\u201d when seduced or raped. [Damage is assessed by how much a person would get on the slave market. According to the Talmud, someone not of sound senses would not have had any value as a slave in any case. Therefore, there are no damages and she is not aware enough to suffer shame].", "2": "There is still another payment, relevant to the mature girl\u2014pain.

The payment for pain is only in the case of rape.", "3": "Now that we limit the Mishnah in Makkot (he gets lashed) to a case where she was seduced, we can say that it refers to a broader set of cases, namely a seduced young girl without a father.

R. Yohanan rejects this resolution and offers a different one in its place.", "2": "Yohanan says that both mishnayot refer to cases where the girl was a na\u2019arah, and therefore he should, at least in principle, pay the fine. However, Makkot (he is lashed) refers to a case where he was warned before he transgressed and Ketubot refers to a case where he was not warned. Since he was not warned, he cannot be lashed, and therefore pays a fine.<br>As a note, according to the rabbis no physical punishment (lashes or execution) can ever be carried out unless the perpetrator is first warned by witnesses that if he commits the crime, he will be punished. This is one example of the rabbis\u2019 severe hesitancy to even theoretically punish criminals.", "3": "The Talmud now notes the implication of R. Yohanan\u2019s alternative solution to the contradiction between the two mishnayot. Unlike Ulla, R. Yohanan holds that when a person is to be lashed (i.e. he was warned) and to pay a fine, he is lashed and does not pay the fine.<br>The question now is the same as it was with regard to Ulla\u2014what is his source?", "4": "The source for R. Yohanan is a verse in Deuteronomy which refers to lashing one who has committed a transgression. The word for \u201cguilt\u201d is singular, so the midrash interprets it to mean that a person receives one punishment (one \u201cguilt\u201d) and not two. Since the punishment is lashes, we can conclude that if he deserves two punishments, lashes and a fine, he is lashed and not fined.", "5": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to discuss R. Yohanan\u2019s ruling that one who deserves lashes and a fine is lashed and not fined. Basically, since R. Yohanan\u2019s rule is the opposite of Ulla, the sources of support for Ulla become difficulties for R. Yohanan.", "6": "As we already know, when one injures another person he pays the fine and does not receive lashes. This seems to contradict R. Yohanan.", "7": "Yohanan had said earlier that he is lashed only if he was warned by witnesses before he committed the crime. The Talmud here refutes a potential resolution to the above difficulty. We might have thought that one who injures another person is fined only if he is not warned. But R. Yohanan himself implied the opposite. If a person strikes another person with a blow where the damages are worth less than a perutah (a very small coin), then no fine can be levied against him. Therefore, in that case, he is lashed. But the implication is clear\u2014if the fine is worth more than a perutah, then he pays the fine and is not lashed, even if he is warned!", "8": "The resolution is that the Torah explicitly says that plotting witnesses have to pay money and are not lashed (the Talmud will explain where below). So too when it comes to personal injury, the Talmud explicitly states that he must pay money and is not lashed.<br>In other words, this is an exception. In other cases (such as one who rapes/seduces his virgin sister, and she is a na\u2019arah) if he was warned, he would suffer lashes and not pay the fine.", "9": "Introduction<br>Ulla had said that the Torah explicitly states that plotting witnesses pay money.

Meir since there are two different verses, one that says that they receive the punishment that they tried to mete out and the other that warns people not to falsely testify, they receive both lashes and the fine. The other sages say that anyone who pays does not receive lashes.", "11": "Ila now explains how we know that plotting witnesses have to pay (and therefore, due to the principle that one gets only one punishment for each crime, are not lashed). The Torah explicitly says that plotting witnesses are punished with the punishment they tried to mete out.

Therefore, we know that plotting witnesses have to pay.", "12": "The same logic is now applied to one who injures another. We know from rabbinic exegesis that he must pay.

The sugya takes time before it gets to the correct answer.", "1": "If the person who rapes/seduces his virgin sister pays the fine and is not lashed, then there is no case where the verse that prohibits one from having sex with his sister would apply. This verse implies (according to rabbinic understanding) that one is punished for transgressing the commandment with lashed.<br>The problem is that we could say the same thing about personal injury and plotting witnesses, two cases where even R. Yohanan agrees that the perpetrators are fined and not lashed. In both cases we could say that if the person is fined, the verse that would seem to indicate lashes for that particular transgression would not be fulfilled.", "2": "The Talmud now finds a way that the verses that require lashes could be fulfilled and yet still in most cases the person would pay.<br>When it comes to plotting witnesses, it is possible that they could be lashed when they testify about something for which they cannot receive the punishment they tried to mete out. For instance, if they testify that a person is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah (a woman rejected from Levirate marriage) who had been married to a priest, the son does not have the status of his father. In other words, they are testifying that someone is not a priest. It does not make sense to say as a punishment the witnesses are not priests, especially if they were not priests to begin with. Therefore, they are lashed.<br>If witnesses falsely testify that someone injured someone but that the damages were less than a perutah, the witnesses are punished with lashes because they cannot be fined. Less than a perutah is nothing.<br>Thus in both of these cases we could say that in principle the person would pay, but under certain circumstances, the verse requiring lashes could be fulfilled.<br>The problem is that the same could be said about rape/seduction. We could say that if he rapes/seduces his virgin sister who is a na\u2019arah (young girl) he pays the fine and is not lashed (against R. Yohanan). But if she was a mature girl, he would be lashed because the fine is not applicable.", "3": "Yohanan now gives an entirely different answer as to why he did not agree with Ulla. The verse Ulla used was \u201cSince (tahat) he had relations with her.\u201d The word \u201ctahat\u201d was compared with the same word used in the case of personal injury to prove that the rapist/seducer pays the fine and is not lashed. But R. Yohanan uses the verse for a different purpose\u2014besides the fine, the rapist pays for shame and physical damages. Since he uses the verse for one \u201cmidrash,\u201d it is not available for another.", "4": "And Ulla?   He derives it from a teaching of Rava, for Rava said: The verse says: \u201cThen the man that lay with her must give to the father of the girl fifty shekel of silver\u201d (Deuteronomy 22:29); for the enjoyment of lying [with her he pays] fifty [shekel of silver], [and from here we infer], by implication, that there is also payment for shame and damages.<br>Ulla could derive Abaye\u2019s halakhah from a different verse that teaches the same thing.

If we warned them before they offer their testimony, they could just say that they forgot the warning. If we were to warn them while they are testifying, they would not testify at all, even if they had true things to say. And we cannot warn them at the end, because once their testimony has been given, it is too late to warn them.", "8": "These two amoraim point out that it would seem to be possible to warn plotting witnesses. First of all, we could warn them immediately after they testify. This would allow them to recant immediately.<br>Aha says we could warn them before they testify and then hint to them while they\u2019re testifying that they were warned not to lie. We could hint gently enough to avoid discouraging them from testifying.", "9": "Abaye now changes his mind and agrees with Rava and R. Elazar that plotting witnesses do not require a warning to be lashed. Plotting witnesses, after all, attempt to kill the accused without warning him, therefore they deserve to be killed without being warned.<br>To return to the argument from the beginning of the page, since they cannot be warned, they are not lashed when they testify about monetary matters.

We know that if someone falsely testifies that another person is the son of a divorcee or a halutzah, in essence saying that he is not a priest, the verse \u201cyou shall do to him as he thought to do to his fellow\u201d does not apply. We don\u2019t say that the witness is not a priest. Rather, he is lashed for his false testimony. But if this is the verse that exempts him from a warning, then we should require a warning for such a false witness before he could be lashed.

If one does kill the man with whom he is fighting or the woman, then he is a murderer and he is executed. According to rabbinic law, he must have been warned before, because if he was not warned, he cannot be executed. Now, the warning that he receives about murder, counts as a warning for the lighter punishment of lashes which he would get for striking another person if death does not occur. Nevertheless, if death does not occur, the perpetrator is fined and not lashed.

Therefore, we have a case of a person warned for a severe matter who is considered warned for a light matter.<br>But Rabbi holds that such a person is not considered a murderer, and therefore the word \u201clife for a life\u201d does not mean \u201clife\u201d but money. The man would pay the value of the woman he accidentally killed to her inheritors. This would allow us to say that the entire case is one where he is not warned. If he was not warned about murder, he would pay the value of the woman he killed and if she was not killed, he would pay the value of the fetuses. But if he was warned, and he caused a miscarriage I could still say that he is lashed and does not pay the fine. So we have not proved yet that he pays the fine.", "4": "Jacob from Nehar Pekod derives the idea that personal injurers pay and are not lashed from a different set of verses.

Now, if there is the possibility that the criminal would be executed, it must mean that he was warned. This warning not to murder is sufficient for the more lenient matter of lashes. So theoretically, if the victim lives, the perpetrator could be lashed because he has been warned. But the Torah clearly says that he pays the loss of work and he pays for his healing; he is not lashed (one cannot receive two punishments).

Meir. R. Meir holds that not only can one be lashed and fined, he can even be executed and fined. This was taught with regard to various crimes of stealing and slaughtering an animal. When the thief slaughters the animal he is liable to pay the four or five fold payment. If he slaughtered it on Shabbat or for idolatrous purposes, he is liable for the death penalty. So this is a case where with one crime he is liable for two penalties\u2014death and a fine. R.

Thus if the agent slaughters on Shabbat, the thief is not liable because the slaughtering does not count as slaughtering because the animal cannot be eaten.

The rabbis had said that he was exempt from paying. But if the prohibition of eating food prepared on Shabbat is only rabbinic, then why should he be exempt from paying the fine, when someone else slaughtered it. [I realize this is a complicated set of assumptions about the case in that baraita]. In other words the agent slaughtered the animal, in which case the original thief should be liable to pay the fine, because the thief did not transgress Shabbat. This is true since the slaughtering is valid, at least by Torah law.<br>The resolution is that the rabbis exempted him in the other cases\u2014either one who slaughtered an ox for idolatry or one who slaughtered an ox that was to be stoned.

But if the agent slaughtered the ox on Shabbat, the thief must pay the fine, even according to the rabbis.", "9": "The Talmud now discusses the other cases in that baraita. The first is one who slaughters an animal for idol worship. Remember, this is an animal that was stolen. According to Rabbi Meir he pays the four or five fold payment, even if he slaughters it for idolatry. The problem is that as soon as he begins to slaughter it for idolatrous purposes, the animal immediately becomes prohibited, and it is not considered to belong to the owner. And then when he completes the slaughtering, it is not the original owner\u2019s ox that he is slaughtering, so why should he be liable to pay back the four or five fold payment!<br>Rava answers that the person says that he is worshiping only at the very completion of the slaughtering. This way the slaughtering is completed at the exact same moment in which he also transgresses the laws of idol worship.", "10": "The Talmud now turns its attention to the other case\u2014a person slaughters an ox condemned to die because it had killed a person. How then can he be liable to pay the owner when this is no longer technically his ox since it had been condemned to death?<br>Rabbah explains the scenario\u2014the original owner gave it to a guardian, and then the ox killed a person and was sentenced to death while still in possession of the guardian. The thief stole it from the guardian\u2019s house. The Talmud will now explain why this is relevant.", "11": "Meir holds that if the guardian returned it after it had been condemned to death, it counts as returned, even though the owner will not be able to do anything with the animal. In addition he holds that an action that causes loss or gain of money counts as money. Together what this means is that when the thief stole it from the guardian\u2019s home he caused a loss of money to the guardian even though it was prohibited for anyone to derive benefit from the ox. Had the ox been alive, the guardian could have returned it to the original owner. Now that it is dead, the guardian will have to pay for the loss of the ox. When the thief stole it he was therefore causing the guardian a loss. Therefore, he owes the guardian money, according to R. Meir."}, "65": {"0": "Introduction<br>In our section, Rabbah goes back a few steps and explains why R. Meir would say that the thief is obligated to pay for the ox even though he is also obligated for the death penalty. Instead of saying that an agent slaughtered it, as was said at the end of daf 33, Rabbah now says that the thief slaughtered it himself.", "1": "The answer is that generally speaking R. Meir holds that one can receive lashes and be fined (for instance, in the case of raping or seducing one\u2019s virgin sister) but generally does not receive the death penalty and a financial penalty for the same crime. However, these three cases (the thief who slaughters the stolen ox on Shabbat, or for idol worship, or an ox condemned to be stoned) are different because they are a \u201ckenas\u201d\u2014or a fine. The laws of fines are considered \u201cinnovative\u201d because they go beyond compensation. Therefore, according to Rabbah, one can get both the death penalty and a fine.", "2": "Rabbah here is following his own reasoning, that one can pay a kenas and still be liable for the death penalty. If he steals a kid before Shabbat and then slaughters it on Shabbat, he is liable for the four fold penalty because he became liable for the theft before Shabbat, and then he became liable for the kenas (the four fold payment) on Shabbat. Rabbah holds that one can pay a kenas and be liable for the death penalty at the same time. However, if he steals the animal on Shabbat and slaughters it on Shabbat, he does not pay anything, because his liability for stealing (evidently carrying the animal), which is penalized by a compensatory payment (paying the principle of what he stole) comes at the same time as he transgresses Shabbat. This is not a kenas a fine\u2014it is simply paying back that which he stole. Since he does not have to pay the first payment because he is liable for the death penalty, he does not pay the extra fines either because without stealing he could not be obligated for slaughtering or selling it.", "3": "Rabbah now refers to a different situation, but one that has a similar formula as the above. When a thief is tunneling into a house, the rabbis consider him as if he is liable for the death penalty because if the owner of the house finds him, he may kill him. So if the thief steals a kid and then breaks into a house and slaughters the kid while he is in the act of breaking into the house, he must pay the fine. This is because he is first liable for stealing and only then liable for the death penalty.<br>But if he steals and slaughters the animal all while breaking into the house, he is exempt from the fine, because one cannot be liable to pay back the principle (the original value of the kid) and be liable for the death penalty at the exact same moment.", "4": "Rabbah has now stated two very similar laws\u2014one concerning the thief who slaughtered on Shabbat and the other concerning a thief who slaughtered while in the act of breaking into a house. The Talmud, as it often does, discusses why we need both laws.<br>If Rabbah had only taught the first law, I might have said that in the case of breaking in, he does pay the fine, because his liability for the death penalty is only temporary. It only exists while he is in the act of breaking in. However, in the case of Shabbat, he is liable for the death penalty forever. Therefore, Rabbah needed to teach the case of the one who slaughters while breaking in.", "5": "In the case of breaking in, the thief may be executed even without a warning from witnesses, a general prerequisite before any criminal is executed. Therefore, I might have said that he is exempt from payment in that case, because he is executed without warning. But in the case of Shabbat, a person may not be executed without first being warned. Since we can assume he was not warned, we might have thought that he would have to pay. After all, in the end they are not going to execute him. Rabbah therefore teaches us that even though he will not be executed, since he is theoretically liable for execution, he is exempt from payment.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to deal with cases where one slaughtered an animal on Shabbat. When is he liable to pay the fine, and when is he not?", "7": "The first half of R. Papa\u2019s law is similar to Rava\u2019s rulings in the previous section. Since he is first liable for being a thief and then liable for transgressing Shabbat, he is not exempt from payment.<br>However, if he borrowed a cow and slaughtered it on Shabbat, he is exempt from the fine. This is because the liability for slaughtering a cow that did not belong to him came at the same moment as the liability for transgressing Shabbat.", "8": "Aha is perplexed\u2014why does R. Papa need to state this rule with regard to a cow? Don\u2019t we already know both halves of this rule?<br>Ashi answers him, that if it were not for R. Papa we might have thought that as soon as he takes possession of the cow he becomes completely responsible for it, as if it were his own. This would imply that when he later slaughters the ox, he is slaughtering an ox that already belonged to him and that the liability for the money would be at the time of possession, earlier than the liability for Shabbat. Therefore, R. Papa teaches us that the ox is not totally his from the time he borrows it. He is only liable for the accident at the moment it happens. Therefore, the liability to pay back the value of the ox comes at the same time that the liability for slaughtering the ox comes. He is liable for death and not the financial penalty.", "9": "If orphans take possession of their father\u2019s borrowed cow, they may use the cow and if it dies, they are not responsible because they were not the borrowers.<br>If they thought that they owned it through their inheritance and they slaughtered it, they are only responsible for paying back the value of the meat at the lowest price. This is the minimum amount that they benefited. In other words, they really are not responsible to pay back the cow, they merely don\u2019t get to benefit from it. Therefore they have to pay the amount that they may have paid for food in any case. Rashi adds that they also the hide back to the owners.", "10": "Rava\u2019s statement goes on to teach that if the father left land to repay the borrowed cow, the inheritors must pay back the full value of the cow. The question is which part of Rava\u2019s statement does this refer to?<br>Some say it refers to the first case, where the animal died on its own. If they have to pay back even if the animal dies, then all the more so they have to pay back if they slaughter it themselves. This means that the father assumed responsibility over anything that happens from the time he borrowed the animal. This disagrees with R. Papa who said that this liability happened only when the animal died, and in this case since they didn\u2019t borrow it, they wouldn\u2019t be liable.<br>But the one who teaches it in reference to the last clause, where they slaughtered it, would hold that it does not refer to the case where the animal died on its own. This position would agree with R. Papa that they do not become liable for anything that might happen to the ox from the time they borrow it.", "11": "Introduction<br>This section refers to the two different ways to solve the contradiction between the Mishnah in Ketubot and the Mishnah in Makkot. According to R. Yohanan, Ketubot exempts the one who rapes/seduces his virgin sister from lashes because the witnesses did not warn him before he committed his crime; Makkot obligates him for lashes (and exempts him from the fine) because they did warn him. Resh Lakish said that the Mishnah in Ketubot follows R. Meir who holds that one can receive lashes and pay the fine.<br>As is typical in the Talmud, the question is why each amora does not hold by the other amora\u2019s solution.", "12": "Yohanan does not agree with Resh Lakish because R. Yohanan\u2019s explanation allows the mishnah to follow the majority opinion of the rabbis, and not the minority opinion of R. Meir. But why doesn\u2019t Resh Lakish accept R. Yohanan\u2019s resolution that our mishnah refers to a case where they did not warn him, and therefore he cannot be lashed?", "13": "According to Resh Lakish, since the person would be exempt from paying the fine if he had been warned (he would be lashed), he is also exempt if he was not warned. In other words, according to Resh Lakish the ability to actually lash the perpetrator is immaterial. All that matters is the nature of the crime. If one commits a crime for which he could be penalized with lashes and a financial penalty, he is lashed and does not pay the fine, even if in the end he cannot really be lashed. That is why he has to assign the mishnah to R. Meir who holds that one can be fined and lashed for the same crime.", "14": "This section states basically the same as above, but in a more principled manner. According to R. Yohanan if one commits a crime inadvertently that would carry with it the death penalty (or lashes or something else) had it been done intentionally, he is liable for the fine. Since they didn\u2019t warn him, and therefore we have to assume that it was an unwitting sin, he is liable for the fine.<br>Resh Lakish says that since the crime carries with it the death penalty (or lashes or something else) he can never pay the fine, even if they did not warn him.", "15": "Resh Lakish raises a difficulty against R. Yohanan. The verse in the Torah that is the source of the notion that one cannot get two penalties for the same crime is from Exodus 21. The Torah says that if no harm, meaning death, comes to the woman, the husband must pay for the miscarried fetuses. To Resh Lakish this implies that if the woman does die, the husband does not pay for the fetuses, even if the husband cannot be executed because he was not warned.<br>Yohanan rejects this and reads the verse to imply that if the law concerning \u201charm\u201d meaning death to the woman is not relevant, then the husband pays the fine. The husband is liable even if he cannot be executed because he was not warned."}, "66": {"0": "This section is just a reverse of the previous section.", "1": "Introduction<br>Earlier we saw an opinion that if one committed two crimes simultaneously, for one he is liable for death/lashes and for the other a fine, then he is exempt from the fine because he would receive the more serious penalty. But there was a debate if he is liable for the fine if he cannot receives lashes/death because he committed that transgression unintentionally. For instance, if he burned down a house on Shabbat but did not know that this was forbidden on Shabbat, or he did not know that it was Shabbat, some hold that he pays the fine because he cannot be punished for transgressing Shabbat, and some hold that he is not liable for the fine.", "2": "As we will see, Rava holds that everyone agrees that if one commits a sin for which he would be liable for death if done intentionally and is also liable to pay a fine, he does not pay the fine. Paradoxically, the person who damages property and commits a religious crime at the same time pays nothing, whereas the person who just damages property would pay.", "3": "The house of Hezekiah (his study house) bases this midrash on Exodus 24:21\u2014\u201cOne who kills an animal must pay, and one who kills a person must die.\u201d Hezekiah reads these as absolute. In the case of killing an animal, the one who does so must always pay, no matter if he does this intentionally or not, and no matter how he does it. The same is true if one kills. It does not matter whether he does so intentionally or not, he never pays compensation.<br>I should note that on a simple sense, there is nothing absurd about this. It teaches that property is always an issue of financial compensation. One never executes a person for destroying property. And the opposite is also true, one never pays for the taking of a life. Life and property cannot be equated. As a value statement, this makes perfect sense. The problem is when we understand it not as a value statement, but a legal one. If one accidentally murders, say in a car accident, then it would seem to make common sense that he should pay the damages. Otherwise you arrive at the absurdity that if one accidentally runs over another car and kills another person, he is not punished at all, whereas if no one died, he would pay the fine. As I\u2019ve said before, this is an absurdity, one example of why the Jewish penal code could not actually be used in practice.", "4": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to deal with the issue of whether one is liable to pay a fine when one has unintentionally committed a crime for which he would be liable for death or lashes.", "5": "Ravin says that all indeed do agree that if one commits a crime inadvertently for which he would have been liable for death had he committed it willfully, he does not pay the fine. They argue if the two punishments would have been lashes and a fine\u2014according to R. Yohanan he pays the fine, since in the end he is not lashed. The verse cited by the house of Hezekiah referred only to death and a fine\u2014when the punishment is death, he is never fined. But there was no such comparison for lashes. Therefore, if he cannot be lashed because the sin was unintentional, he is fined.", "6": "Resh Lakish holds that the same is true with one who commits a crime punishable by lashes\u2014even if inadvertent and therefore he cannot be lashed, he does not pay the fine. This is because the Torah explicitly equates the two\u2014those who are liable for lashes and those who are liable for death.", "7": "The amoraim now search for where the Torah compares one who commits a sin punishable by death with one who commits a sin punishable by lashes. According to Abaye, the comparison is made when the Torah calls both wicked\u2014Numbers refers to one liable for death and Deuteronomy refers to one liable for lashes. Thus the same rules apply to both.<br>Rava derives it from \u201cone who strikes.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s section discusses which word this refers to. In other words, where does the Torah use this word in reference in reference to lashes. We know where it uses it in connection with the death penalty\u2014Leviticus 24:21. Stay tuned!", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues yesterday\u2019s. Here we look for where the Torah might have used the word \u201cstrikes\u201d in connection with lashes such that we could say that death and lashes have the same rule\u2014if one inadvertently commits a crime for which he would be liable for lashes had he done it intentionally, he does not pay the fine.", "9": "Papa is looking for a verse in which the word \u201cstrike\u201d means to hit someone without killing them such that the perpetrator would be liable for lashes and not the death penalty. But Leviticus 24:21 refers to one who kills and therefore this is not the correct \u201cstrike.\u201d", "10": "The next suggestion is that the use of the word striking to mean hitting but not killing comes from Leviticus 24:18-19. Here the word \u201cstriking\u201d is used in reference to the animal but the problem is that this word is not used in reference to striking a person. Nevertheless, the Talmud finds this sufficient because the words mean the same thing. Thus, we are led to think that just as one who inadvertently commits a crime for which he would be liable for death had he done it intentionally is exempt from paying a fine, so too is one who inadvertently commits a crime for which he is liable for lashes.", "11": "The problem is that the verse from Leviticus refers to one who injures another person, and in reality such a person is not lashed, as we have learned. He pays the person he has injured, and is not lashed.", "12": "There is a case in which a person would be lashed for striking another person\u2014if the damages he causes are not worth a perutah. Less than a perutah is not considered to have any value. Therefore, since he does not owe money to the person he struck, he is lashed. So now we have a case where the word \u201cstriking\u201d results in lashes."}, "67": {"0": "The problem is that we can still think about the person who struck another person as liable for payment. We could still say that in general a person who inadvertently commits a sin for which he is liable for lashes and money does pay money since he cannot be lashed. In other words, he is exempt from paying because he didn\u2019t really damage the person, not because he could theoretically be lashed.<br>The answer is that the verse could refer to a case where a person struck another person and damaged his property at the same time. If he was not warned then he cannot be lashed for striking another person. And since he is theoretically liable for lashes, he  also does not pay the fine.<br>So to summarize\u2014if one strikes another and causes no property damage, he pays compensation for bodily damage. If one strikes another and causes property damage but no bodily damage, he will pay nothing. If he was warned beforehand he will be lashed, and if he was not warned beforehand, nothing will happen to him. Again, we see the impracticality of Jewish law.", "1": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section deals with the statement of the House of Hezekiah from earlier on this page (section one). To aid I am quoting the English in its entirety:<br>\u201cHe that kills a man . . . he that kills a beast:\u201d Just as in [the case of] the killing of a beast you have made no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to free exempt him [from the payment], but [to in any case] make him liable to pay, so also in [the case of] the killing of a person you shall make no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to make him liable to pay money, but to free him from paying money?", "2": "The House of Hezekiah stated that when it comes to killing the animal, the Torah made no distinction\u2014one who does so pays, whether he has been warned or not. But R. Hiyya points out that this is not necessarily true. If one kills an animal on Shabbat he does not pay the fine because he has transgressed Shabbat. If so, we could not state categorically that one who kills an animal pays a fine, and then we could not state categorically that one who kills a person does not pay a fine.", "3": "Rava (or the Talmud) now explains why the verse must refer to a week day and not Shabbat. The verse says that if he killed a man, he must be put to death. This means that he was warned, for if he was not warned he could not be put to death. So if he was also warned not to kill an animal on Shabbat because if he did he would be liable for death, then he would be executed and not pay the fine. Therefore, the verse which says that he does pay the fine, must refer to the week day. On the week day, he will always pay a fine for killing an animal and never pay a fine for killing a man.", "4": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section refers back to a statement made by Rabbah on page 34b. The following is the quote:<br>Rabbah said: Indeed [it speaks of a case] when he slaughtered it himself and R. Meir holds the view that [though generally] one may receive the lashes and pay, one cannot receive the death penalty and pay but these [cases]  are different, because the Torah has enacted something novel with regard to a fine, and [therefore]  he has to pay, although he has to suffer the death penalty.<br>According to Rabbah since the case of fine is a \u201cnovelty\u201d one can, under certain circumstances, pay and suffer the death penalty. The specific case referred to here was a thief who stole an animal and slaughtered it on Shabbat. He is liable for the death penalty slaughtering on Shabbat, and he pays the four or five fold fine. Our sugya discusses this claim.", "5": "According to the Mishnah if one rapes his virgin daughter, he is executed and does not pay the fine, because daughter incest is punishable by death. This does not accord with R. Meir, who holds that one can suffer the death penalty and pay a fine. According to the Mishnah, if he rapes his virgin sister, he can be lashed and pay a fine. This does not accord with R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh who holds that one cannot be lashed and pay a fine for the same crime. Finally, our mishnah says that he is liable for karet for raping his sister. According to the mishnah in Makkot, the court lashes one who is liable for karet. But R. Isaac disagrees with this principle\u2014one liable for karet is not lashed. According to R. Isaac one who rapes his sister is not lashed at all, therefore he pays the fine. But all agree that one who rapes a mamzeret is lashed. So our mishnah that holds that he pays a fine would not accord with R. Isaac.", "6": "Rabbah could solve the problem by following R. Yohanan who says that our mishnah according to which he pays a fine even though he is liable for karet, refers to a case where he was not warned and therefore cannot be lashed. This would allow the Mishnah to work with R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh. But Resh Lakish did not hold like R. Yohanan. So if Rabbah holds like Resh Lakish, then how could Rabbah then understand the mishnah.<br>The answer is quite simple\u2014Rabbah holds like R. Yohanan.", "7": "According to Resh Lakish one who deserves lashes does not pay the fine, even if he cannot actually be lashed. So then who is the tanna of our Mishnah in Ketubot that does hold that he is lashed and pays the fine? The answer is that it is either R. Meir or R. Isaac. R. Meir would simply hold that he indeed is lashed and pays a fine. R. Isaac would say that according to our Mishnah he receives karet, but he is not fined. Therefore he is lashed.", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s sugya opens with a new baraita (yes, this section for the first time in a very, very long time, is not directly connected with the previous one).<br>The baraita refers to two topics that really the same. The first is the fine paid for rape and the second is the payment for seduction, both of a virgin. These are the payments outlined in Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (rape) and Exodus 22:15-16 (seduction). The rabbis generally equate these two laws such as that they apply equally.<br>Furthermore, I should again emphasize that by the rabbinic period these issues were no longer practiced. As is often the case, the rabbinic discussion is more connected to theory of law than practical law.<br>The baraita lists women who may not claim these payments.", "9": "Below the Talmud will explain what \u201cforbidden relations\u201d are. Relations forbidden in the second degree are secondary incest prohibitions. This will also be explained below.<br>An aylonit is someone who is clearly female, but never develops signs of reaching sexual maturity. By definition she cannot give birth.<br>A \u201cwoman who has gone out on account of an evil name\u201d seems to refer to a woman whose husband accused her of not being a virgin at the time of her marriage. This too will be discussed below.", "10": "If \u201cforbidden relations\u201d refers to biblical incest prohibitions, then \u201crelations forbidden in the second degree\u201d would assumedly refer to those relationships prohibited by the rabbis. This would include grandmother and other such distant relations. The problem is that if the relationship is only prohibited by rabbinic law, then why shouldn\u2019t she receive the fine, which is mandated by biblical law. This is understandable when it comes to the biblical prohibitions, but not with regard to the secondary category."}, "68": {"0": "The Talmud now interprets both phrases in the baraita as referring to relations prohibited by the Torah. The first category refers to those punishable by death (such as daughter or mother), the second to those punishable by karet (such as sister). In these cases, the perpetrator does not pay the fine because he receives the worse punishment.<br>But if the woman was simply prohibited by a negative commandment (such as a mamzeret), she is eligible for the fine. According to Shimon the Yemenite (statement found at the beginning of this chapter) as long as the marriage is possible, he is liable for the fines. Since marriage with a woman prohibited by the punishments of death or karet is not possible, there is no fine. But marriage with a woman prohibited by a negative commandment is possible, therefore he does pay the fine.", "1": "According to this understanding of the Mishnah, even for women prohibited only by a negative commandment (no karet, no death penalty) there is no fine. This accords with R. Shimon ben Menassia who said earlier in the chapter that if the marriage is even prohibited, there is no fine. Even if the marriage is viable. Thus a mamzeret would not get the fine.", "2": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to explain the baraita that was at the end of last week\u2019s daf, concerning certain categories of women who do not receive the fine for being raped or seduced.<br>There is one term that is helpful to know for this section\u2014na\u2019arah. A na\u2019arah is a girl between the age of being a minor and being an adult. Sometimes this is defined by absolute age\u2014from 12 to 12 \u00bd, and sometimes it is defined by physical development, a na\u2019arah being a girl who has begun to reach puberty but has not completed it.", "3": "A woman who refuses her husband refers to the situation where a young girl was married off by her mother or brother. Such a marriage has a lesser legal status than if she were married off by her father. Therefore, when she is older she has a right to refuse the marriage. Such a woman does not receive the fine because she has, to a certain extent, already been married, even if that marriage was annulled. As a reminder, these fines are only for virgins, women who have never been married.<br>The implication is that an ordinary minor does receive the fine. This accords with the opinion of the rabbis, as we shall see below.", "4": "According to the second clause of last week\u2019s baraita, the aylonit, a woman who never shows signs of puberty, also does not receive a fine. This seems to accord with R. Meir, who holds that since she goes straight from being a minor to being an adult (at the age of 20) she has no period of being a na\u2019arah, a young girl, the category referred to in the Torah.<br>The problem is that the first clause (the woman who refused marriage) accords with the sages, who hold that an ordinary minor does receive a fine, and the second seems to accord with R. Meir, who holds that an aylonit does not receive a fine.", "5": "The first attempt at solving the baraita would involve positing that R. Meir would agree with R. Judah that even a na\u2019arah, a girl from the age of puberty through the next six months, could refuse marriage. This would mean that a na\u2019arah who refuses marriage does not receive the fine, but a regular na\u2019arah does receive a fine, and now the Mishnah could accord with R. Meir who agrees on this point. We would not need to deduce, as we did  above, that a regular minor receives a fine.<br>The problem is that R. Meir explicitly disagrees with R. Judah. R. Meir holds that a girl has the right to refuse marriage until she hits puberty, that is to say as long as she is a minor. R. Judah holds that she can refuse until she is well into puberty, that is to say, even while she is a na\u2019arah.", "6": "The next possibility would be to identify the mishnah as being that of R. Judah. He would say that a girl who refuses marriage as a na\u2019arah does not receive the fine, but a regular na\u2019arah does. A minor would not receive a fine. He would agree with R. Meir that an aylonit does not receive a fine because she is not a na\u2019arah.", "7": "Much later in this chapter, Rav will identify this mishnah with R. Meir. By saying the mishnah is Rabbi Meir he is tacitly admitting that the mishnah agrees only with R. Meir and not with R. Judah. So we cannot say that R. Judah agrees with R. Judah. Rather, R. Judah holds that a minor does receive a fine.", "8": "The final answer is that the mishnah agrees with R. Meir that a minor does not receive a fine, only a na\u2019arah does. This explains why the aylonit does not receive a fine\u2014she is never a na\u2019arah. But the mishnah disagrees with R. Meir and holds that a girl can refuse marriage even when she is a na\u2019arah. This means that when the mishnah says that a girl who refused marriage does not receive a fine, it refers to a na\u2019arah. We can then deduce that a regular na\u2019arah does receive a fine, but a minor does not.", "9": "Rafram offers a different solution. The mishnah does not refer to a girl who actually refused marriage. It actually refers to a girl who is of the age at which she could refuse marriage, that is to say a minor. The whole mishnah would now accord with R. Meir\u2014a minor does not receive a fine.<br>The problem is that if the mishnah wanted to teach this, it should have just said, \u201ca minor does not receive a fine.\u201d Why refer to the minor in such a strange way.<br>The Talmud does not solve this problem.", "10": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s mishnah discusses the clause in the baraita about the aylonit, the female who never reaches sexual maturity.", "11": "According to our mishnah, an aylonit (a woman who never shows signs of sexual maturity) still receives the fine for rape or seduction. But there is a baraita that says the opposite.<br>The baraita also talks about virginity claims, a topic you may remember from chapter one. According to this baraita, a woman who is an aylonit can make a claim to the fine for rape.", "12": "The simple solution is that these two baraitot follow different rabbis, as we learned yesterday. R. Meir holds that only a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d has a claim to the fine, and since an aylonit is never a na\u2019arah (she goes directly from being a minor to being of majority age), she never receives the fine. The rabbis hold that even a minor has a claim on the fine, and therefore an aylonit can also claim the fine.", "13": "The Talmud now transitions to a better difficulty on the earlier baraita. According to that baraita a husband can make a virginity claim again a deaf-mute wife or one lacking sound senses. But according to this baraita, a virginity claim cannot be made against these women.", "14": "R. Sheshet solves these two problems by ascribing each position to a different tanna, of the two tannaim who argued in chapter one, mishnah six. According to Rabban Gamaliel if a man claims that his wife was not a virgin she can defend herself by saying that she was raped after betrothal. (For more information see Ketubot 1:6).<br>This would mean that a husband basically cannot make a virginity claim against his wife because she will always have such a defense readily available. This equates, according to R. Sheshet, with the baraita that does not allow a husband of a deaf-mute or a woman not of sound senses to make a virginity claim. R. Joshua says that she cannot make such a defense, so he is the author of the baraita that allows such a husband to make a virginity claim against his wife.", "15": "The problem is that Rabban Gamaliel said that a woman was believed to make this specific claim. He did not seem to say that if a woman cannot make such a claim, we offer the claim on her behalf.<br>But in the end, that is what the Talmud says. If the woman cannot make a claim on her own behalf because she is a deaf-mute or lacking sound senses, her husband cannot make a virginity claim against her.

What this really means is that the rabbis did not believe that a girl who reached maturity age was a virgin anymore. While I do not know why they believed this, I would venture the guess that they may have believed that since she started to menstruate, her virginity blood is gone, perhaps washed away. The other interesting thing to note is that if most girls were not married until they were of age (this we know to be true) then virginity claims would not have been applicable to most women.<br>The difficulty is that Rav made another statement that seems to contradict this. Rav is dealing with the first night after a wedding, and with the problem of distinguishing between menstrual blood and virginal blood. It is forbidden for the couple to have sex if she is menstruating, but if the blood is virginal, they are permitted. Rav says that if the girl had reached the age of maturity, they can have sex the whole night without concern that the blood is menstrual. Clearly he believes that mature girls have virginal blood, so why, then, does the baraita say that there is no virginity claim against them."}, "69": {"0": "The answer is that a husband can claim that his wife was not a virgin because she did not bleed. As we saw from Rav, we can anticipate that mature women do have virginal blood. But he cannot make the claim that she is \u201can open door\u201d a type of virginity claim referred to on pages 9-10 of this tractate.<br>I should note that this resolution is very difficult and contradicts other passages in the Talmud where we can see that the rabbis believed that mature girls did not have virginal blood. Furthermore, there are different versions of the line in manuscripts and medieval commentaries.", "1": "Summachus says that blind women cannot have virginity claims brought against them. The Talmud explains that blind women may have lost their virginal blood by some strenuous act (today this could be something like horse-back riding). If this occurs to a seeing girl, she will show her mother and the girl will know what happened. The problem, according to Summachus, is that the blind girl cannot see what happened to her, so she would not know that she is not a virgin.", "2": "The baraita that we learned in last week\u2019s daf said that a woman who goes out because of an evil name, i.e. an adulteress, receives no fine or payment for being seduced. The problem is that a woman who commits adultery is liable to be stoned for adultery. Of course she doesn\u2019t receive the fine.<br>Sheshet resolves the problem by claiming that the baraita refers to a woman who had an evil name go out about before she was married, while she was still young. Such a woman does not receive the fine for rape or seduction, because she is assumed not to be a virgin. Since the fine applies only to a virgin, she does not receive it.<br>[To reiterate, the fact that only a virgin receives the fine does not mean that rabbis sanctioned rape as long as the woman was not a virgin. The \u201cfine\u201d is a descendant of the biblical bride price paid to the father, which was only applicable to the virgin].", "3": "Papa derives from this that an unsound debt document cannot be used to collect a debt.

The woman claims to be a virgin but there is a rumor that she is not.<br>The problem is that Rava said such rumors are ignored.", "4": "Since rumors aren\u2019t trusted, the Talmud reinterprets the \u201cevil name\u201d about the document or the woman.

This would seem to be sufficient evidence to call into question either her virginity or the document\u2019s accuracy.", "5": "The problem is that the two situations are not really comparable. With regard to the woman, we can assume that some men would have fornicated with her (this seems like a sound assumption to me). But with regard to forging a document, how can we be so sure that he eventually found someone to forge the document. Most people will not forge documents.<br>The answer is that even if he couldn\u2019t find someone else to do it, since we know that he was trying to forge the document, we can assume that in the end, even if he couldn\u2019t find anyone else to do it, he would have forged it himself. This makes perfect sense\u2014would you trust a document that you know someone was trying to have forged?<br>One interesting side note about this section is how R.

It teaches those cases opposite of those mentioned in yesterday\u2019s mishnah.<br>I should note that the opposite of many of these cases is found in the first mishnah of the chapter, which we learned way back on the beginning of Daf 29.", "7": "<b>Section one:</b>  In these cases the women are assumed to be non-virgins, and hence do not receive the fine.<br>Rabbi Judah rules that any captive who is redeemed is assumed not to have been raped and is therefore a virgin.<br><b>Section two:</b>  Having intercourse with these women is a capital crime.  Since the man is liable for the death penalty, he does not pay the fine, for there is a principle that one cannot be executed and pay a fine.  This is learned exegetically from the words in Exodus 21:22.  The case under discussion is when a man strikes a woman causing her to miscarry.  The Torah states that if there is no other \u201cdamage\u201d, then he must pay the fine.  The interpretation is that if the woman herself doesn\u2019t die, then the striker pays a fine for having caused her to miscarry.  Had she died, the striker would have been a murderer and would not have paid the fine.  Note that this is true even if the damages were caused accidentally.  Although one cannot be executed for an accidental murder, the rule of the Mishnah is that anytime a person commits a crime which is punishable by death had it been committed with intention, he is exempt from the fine.<br>A note about the Mishnah and Talmud\u2019s references to sexual intercourse with young girls:<br>The rabbis occasionally reference sexual relations with young girls, even under the age of three.  I expect that this will cause discomfort to people reading the mishnah, and when I think of my own three year old daughter, this makes me queasy as well. We would do well to realize that the Mishnah\u2019s discussion of all legal possibilities does not imply their tacit approval of them.  The Mishnah discusses many crimes without expressing horror over them, because the Mishnah is often interested in legal consequences. The rabbis certainly did not condone sexual relations with girls this young.", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins to deal with the mishnah, particularly R. Judah\u2019s statement that we do not suspect that a captive woman has been raped.", "9": "R. Judah in the Mishnah said that if a woman is taken captive, we can assume that she was not raped. R. Yohanan will now try to equate that opinion with that of R. Dosa found elsewhere.", "10": "According to R. Dosa, we do not assume that female captives were raped. At worst, they may be touched by their captors. [I apologize for the graphic language. I didn\u2019t write it, but still].", "11": "Rava tries to now say that it might be that R. Judah and R. Dosa might not agree. This is a difficulty on R. Yohanan.<br>Judah might have said that a female captive is assumed not to have been raped only so that she could be considered a virgin and her rapist/seducer would have to pay the fine. But vis a vis other issues (such as staying married to her priestly husband) he might agree that we need to be concerned that she was raped.", "12": "It is also possible that R. Dosa said that we can assume she was not raped only with regard to eating terumah, which after the destruction of the Temple is only of rabbinic status. But when it comes to the rapist or seducer paying the fine, which is of Toraitic status, we would not make him liable to pay the fine unless we could be 100 per cent sure that she was a virgin. Again, R. Dosa may not have made a blanket statement with regard to the captive woman.", "13": "Abaye critiques Rava\u2019s proposal that R. Judah may hold that a female captive is assumed to remain a virgin only to force subsequent rapist to pay the fine (\u201cthat the sinner should gain no advantage\u201d). The problem is that R. Judah assumes that she is a virgin with regard to the size of the ketubah she would receive when she gets married later in life. According to R. Judah, she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz, the ketubah of a virgin. The one who marries her is certainly not sinning, so why should he have to give her 200 zuz, as if we could be certain that she was a virgin? The answer seems to be that R. Judah really believes that she was not raped.", "14": "The Talmud now rejects Abaye\u2019s difficulty on Rava, and posits a totally separate reason why R. Judah would say that when it comes to getting married, she is presumed a virgin. If she received a ketubah of 100, we would have to fear that men would refrain from marrying her, the idea being that men back then (and I\u2019m still sure it\u2019s true in places now) prefer to marry virgins.<br>To summarize: R. Judah might not make a blanket assumption that captive women were not raped. He could say that it depends on what the ramifications of such an assumption would be. When it comes to the fine, he would say that a man who rapes a woman who had been taken captive must pay the fine, so that he should not be rewarded. A woman who had been taken would still receive a ketubah of 200, to encourage men to marry her. But a woman who had been taken captive would not be allowed to stay married to her husband the priest.", "15": "Introduction<br>In the mishnah R. Judah holds that a woman who was taken captive should not be assumed to have been raped. This section questions whether that is what R. Judah really holds.", "16": "In this baraita, the issue is whether one who is involved in redeeming a captive woman may marry her (assuming he is a priest, who may not marry her if she was raped). The Talmud will explain the baraita as we proceed, but for now it is sufficient to note that according to R. Judah, in either case he may not marry her. Clearly, however we interpret this baraita, R. Judah says that there is an assumption that she was raped.", "17": "The Talmud explains what it believes the baraita really means. If a man redeems a woman and testifies that she has not been raped, he himself is allowed to marry her, even if he is a priest. We can assume that he redeemed her in order to marry her [I know this might be distasteful]. But if he merely testifies on her behalf, he can\u2019t marry her, because we are concerned that he is lying in order to allow her to marry him. Generally, people who give testimony cannot benefit from that testimony.", "18": "Papa resolves the contradiction between R. Judah in the baraita and R. Judah in the Mishnah by emending the baraita. R. Judah says that in either case he is allowed to marry her, in line with his opinion in the Mishnah that a female captive is not assumed to have been raped.", "19": "Huna\u2019s resolution is slightly different from R. Papa\u2019s. He maintains the reading of the baraita, but says that R. Judah was not stating his own opinion.<br>Rather, R. Judah was arguing against the opinion of the rabbis. He says that if you\u2019re going to fear that someone would testify on behalf of the woman just so he could marry her, the same fear would exist even if he redeems her.", "20": "The rabbis explain the difference between a man who redeems and testifies on behalf of the woman and one who merely testifies on her behalf. Since the former spent money to redeem her, we can assume that he really believes that she was not raped. He wouldn\u2019t have spent money just to redeem a woman prohibited to him. But if he merely testifies that he believes she was not raped, we must fear that he is lying.<br>[This is not a straightforward assumption. After all, we suspect a man might falsely testify, but we don\u2019t suspect he would spend money to get a wife prohibited to him. This seems strange to me. Therefore, I would read our concerns over false testimony not that he intentionally lies. Rather, we fear he says that he knows something even if he is not absolutely certain of it.]"}, "70": {"0": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf continues to deal with R. Judah\u2019s statement from the mishnah, that we do not assume that a woman taken captive was raped. Is this really his position? Is it consistent with his position elsewhere? ", "1": "We now learn another source which according to R. Papa b. Shmuel proves that R. Judah does not hold that a captive woman is assumed to be a virgin. The baraita refers to two issues concerning a convert. The first is a case where she begins to menstruate immediately after conversion. The question is whether she is treated like all Jewish women who retroactively defile things they touched before they noticed they were menstruating. According to R. Judah she does not. She only defiles that which she touches from that point onward. According to R. Yose she is like all other women. She retroactively defiles anything she touched either in the last twenty-four hours, or from the last time she examined herself.<br>According to R. Judah, she also must wait three months before marrying, in order to distinguish a child conceived before she became Jewish and one from after she converted. R. Yose says she need not wait.<br>The fact that R. Yose says she need not wait implies that she we do not assume she had sex before converting (assuming she has not yet been married). Therefore, R. Judah would say that we must be concerned that she was raped. And at this point, it seems that R. Judah equates all non-Jews with captors. To R. Judah, a woman who converts is assumed to have had sex within the past three months. ", "2": "R. Joseph replies that the comparison is invalid. A convert, meaning a woman before she converts, does not know that she is eventually going to convert. Therefore, she does not protect herself from having sex (outside of marriage). Thus, R. Judah would hold that she must wait to get married, lest she became pregnant while still a non-Jew. In contrast, a captive will protect herself, knowing that she will be redeemed. Therefore, R. Judah assumes that she remains a virgin.<br>A word about rabbinic attitudes towards non-Jews: Rabbis at times assume the worst about non-Jews, that they are murderers, fornicators, robbers, etc. Part of this might be the experience of a people occupied by foreign rulers (Romans or Babylonians), but part of this might also be a general human tendency to demonize the other. The rabbis may cast the gentiles in the worst light as a way of imagining what the worst possibilities are for human beings.<br>By the medieval period, and certainly in the modern period, these attitudes towards non-Jews had changed, at least among modern Jews. So while I can understand the Talmudic attitude, I think we should be thankful that nowadays, things are different. ", "3": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to question the notion that R. Judah holds that a woman taken captive is not assumed to have been raped. It sharpens the difficulty by noting a baraita in which R. Judah explicitly states that a woman taken captive must wait three months to get married (or continue sleeping with her Israelite husband) lest she have become pregnant while taken captive.", "4": "According to this baraita, R. Judah holds that anyone who goes from a state of not being Jewish, not being free, or of being a captive, must wait three months before marrying, so that we can determine if the child was conceived by the captor, or before the woman converted or was freed. [The words older than three years and one day seem to be a mistake here, perhaps from the context of virginity claims. Obviously a three year old cannot be pregnant].<br>Yose again has no such concern. This proves that R. Judah holds that we must assume that a captive woman was raped.", "5": "Joseph does not know how to respond to this difficulty. So he asks R. Papa b. Shmuel to solve the contradiction. The latter does so by citing a teaching of R. Sheshet who says that R. Judah refers to a case where people saw her have intercourse with her captor (or in the other cases that she had intercourse with someone). Of course in such a case we must be concerned that she is pregnant. But in any other case, we need not be concerned.", "6": "The problem is that if someone says they saw her have intercourse before conversion, redemption or manumission, then why would R. Yose assume that she was not pregnant. In other words, the resolution to the difficulty on R. Judah, causes a difficulty on R. Yose.<br>Rabbah resolves this by stating that to R. Yose, a woman who fornicates (basically this means non-marital sex) is assumed to use contraception. Therefore we can assume that she is not pregnant.", "7": "The Talmud analyzes whether it makes sense to assume that these women used contraception before they became free or Jewish. In most cases, the Talmud agrees that it makes sense. The woman might not want to become pregnant at that point. A convert might want to wait until conversion to have a child, so that the child would be Jewish. A captive would not want to become pregnant, for she might be redeemed. A slave might have overheard that she is about to be set free, and therefore want to wait until that point to become pregnant.", "8": "The problem is the case of a slave woman who is freed because her master put out her tooth or eye (all slaves go free when this occurs). How can R. Yose assume that she used a contraceptive device? She could not have known beforehand that this would happen. This is similar to a (Jewish) woman who was raped or seduced\u2014she too did not know beforehand that this would occur, and yet R. Yose says that we assume she is not pregnant, and therefore she can be betrothed and married immediately.", "9": "Rabbah now offers a new interpretation for R. Yose\u2014a woman does not use a contraceptive device. Rather, she simply turns over so that she won\u2019t get pregnant. This is something that all women do when they have non-marital sex, even a woman who didn\u2019t know that she was about to have sex. [This is how Rashi explains the sugya. Otherwise we would have to ask the same questions as above\u2014why would these women act in order to prevent conception. How would they have known that it is in their best interest not to become pregnant?].<br>Judah (rightly) questions the effectiveness of such a contraceptive action. Turning over is very unlikely to prevent pregnancy. Therefore we must be concerned.", "10": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section goes on to deal with the next line of the mishnah. According to the Mishnah the notion that one cannot get two punishments for the same crime is derived from Exodus  21:22, the passage where a man accidentally strikes a woman and causes her to miscarry. If the woman dies, he does not pay for the fetuses. This, according to the rabbis, is because he gets the death penalty for killing the mother.", "11": "The Talmud suggests that the principle that one is obligated for only one penalty is derived from Deuteronomy 25:2, which uses the singular in reference to punishing a person for a transgression. He is punished for one wickedness (transgression) but not for two transgressions. So why does our mishnah use a different verse?", "12": "The Talmud, as it often does, argues that both verses are needed, for they address different situations, and one could not be derived from the other.<br>If only the first text from Exodus was used, I might have thought that one cannot be executed and fined because execution is such a stringent penalty. But perhaps we would have thought that someone could be lashed and still pay a fine, because lashing does not involve a loss of life. That is why we need to learn that one cannot receive lashes and a financial penalty.", "13": "If we had learned only that one cannot be lashed and receive a financial penalty, I might have thought that this is because the transgression for which one is lashed is not so grave. That is why he receives only one penalty. But since the transgression punishable by death is graver, I might have thought that one gets the death penalty and is fined. Therefore, we need another verse to teach us that one who gets the death penalty is not also fined.", "14": "Meir holds that one may be lashed and still pay a penalty. So this leaves him without an answer as to why we need two verses both teaching that one cannot receive two penalties for one crime.<br>Meir could answer that we need the two verses to teach that one cannot receive the death penalty and pay the fine, nor can he be executed and lashed (this is not something we spoke about before, assumedly because it\u2019s strange\u2014why would you lash someone and then execute them?)."}, "71": {"0": "Again, the Talmud argues that both texts are needed. I need one text to teach that we do not punish someone\u2019s body (death) and his property (fine) for one crime. But I might have thought that lashing a person and then killing him is like one long death penalty, and therefore it could be done. That is why we need a verse to teach us that a person does not receive lashes and the death penalty for one crime.", "1": "If we had only learned that one cannot be executed and receive lashes, we might have said that this is because both are against his body. But we might have thought that a person could be executed and forced to pay a fine for the same crime. Therefore, the Torah had to teach us both. According to R. Meir, one can get lashes and pay a fine, but not death and another punishment.<br>For an in-depth discussion of Daf Shevui, you can sign up to our Facebook page group at: ", "2": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now continues to ask why we need biblical verses that seem to teach that one cannot give out two penalties for one transgression.", "3": "At first it might seem like Numbers 35:31 teaches the same principle as we have been learning\u2014when a person is executed, he does not also pay the fine. However, this is not what the verse is really teaching. The verse teaches that it is forbidden for a court to take a ransom to allow a murderer to avoid execution. It does not teach that one cannot get the death penalty and also pay a fine.", "4": "The very next verse in Numbers teaches that the court cannot take a ransom to exempt an accidental murderer from having to flee to a city of refuge.", "5": "The Talmud asks now why we need both texts, one dealing with intentional murder and the other with unintentional killing. The answer is similar to the answer found in yesterday\u2019s section. If we had learned that the court cannot take a ransom to exempt a person from the death penalty, we might have thought that this is because the prohibition of murder is so severe. But accidental killing is not severe (it was an accident, after all) and therefore, one could pay a ransom to get out of having to flee to the exile city. Therefore, the verse teaches us that even for exile one cannot pay a ransom.", "6": "If we had only learned that the court cannot receive a ransom to allow an accidental killer to avoid having to flee to the refuge city, we might have thought that this is because this is not such a severe punishment. His life is not taken, therefore, he is not allowed to pay a ransom. But we have thought that a person condemned to execution is allowed to avoid the punishment by paying a ransom, because we wish to avoid execution. Therefore, both texts are necessary. Under no circumstances can one atone for murder or accidental killing by paying a fine.", "7": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to present interpretations for Numbers 35, the section of the Torah about murder and accidental murder, as well as other related passages.", "8": "The verse requires that a murderer\u2019s blood be shed (this is probably the original reason why Jewish execution was done through decapitation, although a different, more midrashic, reason will be expressed below). The Talmud asks why we need to know this\u2014there are other verses that seem to say the same thing. The answer is related to the passage in Deuteronomy about breaking a heifer\u2019s neck if a murderer cannot be found. If the heifer\u2019s neck is broken, and then the murderer is found, the murderer still must be executed. This is read out of the verse from Numbers\u2014atonement cannot be made except by the blood of the one who shed it. Even if the heifer already effected atonement, the murderer must still be executed.", "9": "The verse from Deuteronomy concerning the method of breaking the heifer\u2019s neck is used as the source for the halakhah that execution for murder is done by cutting the head off at the neck. This is derived from the fact that the verse is phrased as a generality\u2014all clean blood is expunged by something being cut at the neck, either the heifer, when the murderer is not known, or of the murderer himself.", "10": "The heifer\u2019s head is chopped off with an axe at the back of its head. But the murderer is killed with a sword from the front of the neck. If execution is derived from how the heifer is killed, why the discrepancy?<br>The answer is a midrash on \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d This is understood to refer even to a case where you are executing your neighbor\u2014choose for him a good way to die. There are several ways in which this could be understood. The first has to do with honor. Chopping someone\u2019s head off the same way you would chop off the head of an animal is not an honorable way to die. It is not a \u201cgood death.\u201d The second could be with the type of wound inflicted. It could be that the ax is a more gruesome method than the sword, or that the back of the neck is more brutal than the front, where the death might be quicker. In any case, I think it\u2019s the principle that is most interesting\u2014even in execution, we are commanded to love our neighbor.", "11": "The Talmud now asks the meaning of another verse, which the Talmud reads as if it refers to a person who has been sentenced to death (this is not the simple meaning of the verse). The baraita refers to a person who vows to give to the Temple another person\u2019s value. This is the topic of chapter 27 in Leviticus. But, we learn here that if a person is being led out to execution, he has no worth. However, if he has not yet been sentenced, then he still has a value, so if someone dedicates him to the Temple, they must pay his value. Note that the value of a person is fixed in the Torah\u2014it depends on gender and age.", "12": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues where we left off yesterday. According to a baraita we read there, if a person dedicates to the Temple the value of a person being taken out to be executed, he does not owe that value, because such a person has no value. Today we learn of dissent on this issue.", "13": "According to R. Hananiah b. Akabia, such a person can have his value dedicated to the Temple, because his value is determined by age and gender and is not related to his actual real worth value (which in this case is basically zero).<br>So what then does he do with this verse, \u201cNone proscribed,\u201d the verse that received a midrash in yesterday\u2019s section.", "14": "There is one case in the Torah in which a person may get out of the death penalty by paying a ransom. This is the case of an owner whose ox (or other animal) kills a person. The Torah says that the owner can be put to death, which the rabbis read as \u201cdeath by the hand of heaven.\u201d However, if the owner pays a ransom, i.e. the value of the person the ox killed, he does not received \u201cdeath by the hand of heaven.\u201d R. Ishmael says that we might have thought that just as one can pay a ransom to avoid death by the hand of heaven, one can also pay a ransom to avoid death by a court. Therefore, the verse teaches that none proscribed (sentenced to execution) by a man can pay a ransom. This might have been read as referring only to \u201csevere death penalties.\u201d Severe death penalties are cases where a person cannot receive atonement even if he does the sin unwittingly (according to Rashi this refers to kidnapping and wounding one\u2019s parents). The word \u201cnone\u201d teaches that the same is true even for sins which can be atoned for if committed unwittingly, such as idol worship, Sabbath laws and fornication. In short, in all cases, one who has been sentenced to death cannot avoid execution by paying a fine.", "15": "The Talmud now asks a logical question\u2014why do we need a special midrash to teach that one may not pay a ransom to avoid execution? There is a verse that states this explicitly! Rami b. Hama answers that both the verse and the midrash are needed lest I think that if one kills another person with a downward motion, he may pay a ransom to avoid the death penalty because had he done so accidentally he would have been able to receive atonement by going to the city of exile. The idea is that when someone kills with a downward motion it could be an accident, whereas killing with an upward motion is assumed to be on purpose. Only the former can be atoned, the latter cannot.<br>Thus both verses are needed to emphasize the same point the Talmud has been emphasizing throughout\u2014under no circumstances may one pay a ransom to avoid the death penalty. This is true whether the sin was done in a manner that could have allowed for atonement, had it been done accidentally, or not."}, "72": {"0": "Introduction<br>At the end of last week\u2019s daf Rami b. Hama stated that the verse, \u201cNone proscribed, that may be proscribed of men\u201d teaches that it does not matter whether one killed with an upward or downward motion, a ransom can never be taken in order to exempt the murderer from the death penalty. Today\u2019s section continues from that point, with Rava saying that we could have learned that halakhah from a different source.", "1": "The tanna of the House of Hezekiah source was found above on daf 35, part 1. This baraita was directly dealing with the issue of what punishment is meted out to a murderer\u2014execution or a fine? The source teaches that there is no distinction between murdering with an upward motion and murdering with a downward motion\u2014the murderer never pays the fine. And just as there is no case in which a murderer pays a fine, so too there can be no distinction between killing with an upward motion and killing with a downward motion with regard to paying a ransom to exempt himself from the death penalty.<br>Since this halakhah emerges from the House of Hezekiah source, we don\u2019t, Rava argues, need to derive the same halakha from the extra verse, \u201cNone proscribed\u2026\u201d This leaves us without a solution as to why we need that verse. Stay tuned for tomorrow, where we will finally answer\u2014what does that verse really teach us?", "2": "Introduction<br>Rami b. Hama again answers why we need several verses that all seem to teach that one cannot take a ransom to allow a person to escape execution.", "3": "Rami b. Hama says that that the verse \u201cDo not take a ransom\u201d is needed to teach the principle that a person who murders and commits another crime at the same time is executed and does not pay the fine, even though there is another verse that could teach the same law. I might have thought that if someone puts out someone\u2019s eye and thereby kills him, he is executed and does not pay for putting out his eye. But if he blinds him and kills him in a different way, not connected to the eye, he would pay for the eye and be executed. Therefore we need another verse to teach the principle that he receives only the more severe of the two penalties.", "4": "Rava again says that the deduction that Rami b. Hama makes from the verse can be derived from elsewhere, causing the deduction to be unnecessary. Another teaching from the House of Hezekiah states one cannot be executed and pay a fine for putting out another person\u2019s eye. Rava seems to take this to mean that one cannot receive two punishments for the same crime. [We should note that this is not the simple meaning of the source. The simple meaning is that when one puts out another person\u2019s eye, he cannot be killed for the crime.]", "5": "Ashi answers that we need two verses to teach the principle that a criminal receives only one of the punishments lest we thought that since fines are an \u201cinnovation,\u201d one could pay a fine and be executed. The concept of \u201cinnovation\u201d is that since there is one thing illogical about the law, namely that one would pay more than the cost of compensation (for instance paying four or five fold for stealing and slaughtering an animal), the entire law might be illogical. This would allow us to think that under certain circumstances, a person could be executed and pay a fine. Therefore, we need two verses to teach us that this is not so.", "6": "Rabbah holds that one can be executed and still pay a fine, specifically because fines are an innovation. So what does Rabbah do with the extra verse, \u201cNone proscribed\u201d? [Note that it is complex as to why this verse is now extraneous. Basically, if the verse, \u201cAnd if there is no catastrophe\u201d (if the woman he struck does not die, and he pays the fine for her miscarriages)  teaches that a person does not pay a fine if he is executed, and the verse \u201cDo not take a ransom\u201d teaches that one can never pay a ransom to get out of the death penalty, the verse \u201cNone proscribed\u201d becomes extraneous.]<br>Rabbah could explain this verse like the Tanna (the anonymous opinion) that argues with R. Hanania b. Akavia (see page 37, sections 5-6). According to this tanna, this verse refers to a one who dedicates the value of a person who is being taken out to be executed. According to this tanna, since such a person is about to be executed, he has no value, and the one who dedicated his value is exempt from any payment.", "7": "Introduction<br>In the chapter that describes rape in Deuteronomy the Torah refers to a \u201cyoung girl, a virgin who has not been betrothed\u201d.  The rabbis understand that this verse means that the laws of paying the fine are limited to a \u201cyoung girl\u201d that is a girl between the ages of 12 and 12 \u00bd and a virgin.  The mishnah which now appears in the Talmud discusses the meaning of the phrase \u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d.", "8": "In the case, a girl was betrothed and then either widowed or divorced, and then she was raped or seduced. The question is\u2014does she receive a fine? Note that if she was betrothed but not divorced or widowed and someone raped her, he would be liable for the death penalty for having committed adultery (she would of course not be liable since she did not willingly commit any crime).  In this case, since he is liable for the death penalty, he does not pay a fine.<br>According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean since the Torah states, \u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d the rapist in this case does not pay the fine.<br>Rabbi Akiva reads the phrase \u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d to be a stipulation for when the father receives the fine. If she has never been betrothed, then her father receives a fine.  If she has been betrothed, but she is still a virgin, for instance she was divorced or widowed before full marriage, the rapist is liable to pay a fine and he pays it directly to her.<br>We should note that R. Akiva\u2019s reading is clearly innovative. The Torah does not seem to assume the possibility of an independent woman. She is either in her father\u2019s house or her husband\u2019s. R. Akiva, and other rabbis elsewhere, carve out some space for the independence of a woman. In this case, despite the origins of the fine as compensation to the father for losing the bride price, she receives the fine.", "9": "Yose the Galilean\u2019s reasoning in the mishnah is clear. Since she has been betrothed, she loses the right to collect a fine. To connect this to its historical roots\u2014the father was paid the bride price by the first husband. If she is betrothed and then divorced before marriage, a man who subsequently has relations with her is not depriving the father of the bride price. Therefore, there is no fine.", "10": "As I explained above, R. Akiva reads the verse differently. If she had never been betrothed, the father receives the fine. If she was betrothed, she receives the fine. We should note that R. Akiva seems to read the fine as a punishment for the rapist. While this may find favor in our eyes (obviously a rapist deserves severe punishment), it does not accord particularly well with the simple meaning and interpretation of the verse. Nevertheless, we might add that the very fact that the rabbis call this a \u201cpenalty (\u05e7\u05e0\u05e1)\u201d probably implies that most rabbis view this as a penalty, and not a replacement for the lost bride price.", "11": "These lines raise a difficulty on R. Akiva\u2019s line of thinking. R. Akiva reads the words \u201cwho was not betrothed\u201d to imply that if she was betrothed, she receives the fine. Extending this logic we would say that the word \u201ca na\u2019arah,\u201d to mean that if the girl is between 12 and 12.5, but if she is older, her father receives the fine. Furthermore, the word \u201ca virgin\u201d would mean that if she was a virgin, her father would receive the fine, but if she was not a virgin, she would receive the fine. We should note that these are not illogical readings of the verse. But this is not how R. Akiva himself reads the verse. He reads the latter exclusions as complete\u2014if she is not a na\u2019arah, there is no fine; if she is not a virgin, there is no fine. So too he should read the other exclusion as complete. If she was betrothed, there is no fine.<br>To put this another way, if R. Akiva reads the payment as a fine for the very act of rape, why doesn\u2019t it apply in all cases of rape? Indeed, this is a very good question.", "12": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues from yesterday\u2019s section where we learned that according to R. Akiva, if the girl has been betrothed and then divorced and then is raped or seduced, there is a fine, but the fine goes to her instead of to her father. The problem with R. Akiva\u2019s statement is how does he interprets the words \u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d which would seem to mean that if she had been betrothed, there is no fine whatsoever.", "13": "The baraita cited here is parallel to the Mishnah. As in the Mishnah, R. Yose the Galilean says that if a girl was once betrothed, she never subsequently receives the fine.", "14": "Akiva in this baraita holds that if the girl was betrothed and then divorced, she is still subject to the laws of the fine. However, in this baraita, as opposed to the Mishnah, he states that logic dictates that the father receives the fine. If the father has the right to the money received for her betrothal, then he would still receive the fine, even though she had already been betrothed.<br>[Note that later the Talmud will ask how R. Akiva in this baraita can so obviously disagree with R. Akiva from the Mishnah].", "15": "Akiva does not interpret the words \u201cWho has not been betrothed\u201d to mean that the girl was never betrothed. After all, to R. Akiva in this baraita, it does not matter whether she was betrothed or not, the father still receives the fine. So then what does he do with those words? He uses them to draw a \u201cgezerah shavah,\u201d a linguistic analogy, between the verse in Deuteronomy, where the exact amount of the fine is stated, and the parallel in Exodus 22:15, where the amount is not stated. Just as in Deuteronomy, the fine for rape is 50 shekels, so too in Exodus, the fine for seduction is 50 shekels.\n"}, "73": {"0": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to explain the baraita that appeared above.", "1": "Akiva uses the phrase \u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d to connect the verses in Deuteronomy with those in Exodus. And the word \u201cvirgin\u201d he interprets literally\u2014if she is not a virgin, she receives no fine. But this is not necessarily logical. He could have interpreted the phrase \u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d literally\u2014if she was betrothed and then divorced she does not receive the fine. And he could have used the word \u201cvirgin\u201d to connect Deuteronomy with Exodus (the word appears in both places).<br>To put this another way, the essential question is, why does he sometimes understand the verse literally and at other times midrashically?", "2": "The first attempt to answer this difficulty is to point out that even though she has been betrothed and then divorced, she is still a virgin and a na\u2019arah. Therefore, this verse should apply to her and she should receive the fine.", "3": "The last answer was not truly logical. I could say that the word \u201cvirgin\u201d is only meant to be used as a reference to Exodus. A non-virgin would still receive the fine, as long as she has not yet been betrothed. Again, we do not have an answer as to why one word is taken literally (\u201cvirgin\u201d) and one is not (\u201cwho has not been betrothed\u201d)", "4": "The Talmud now arrives at what is probably the real reason why R. Akiva reads one word literally and the other as a literary reference to Exodus. A woman who is no longer a virgin has had a physical change in her body. This physical change causes a real change in the law\u2014she no longer receives the fine. But betrothal is only a change in her legal status. Therefore, as long as she is not betrothed when the rape/seduction occurs, then she is still eligible for the fine.", "5": "Yose the Galilean now needs to explain where he derives the halakhah that the payment for rape and seduction are the same. He does so from the words \u201caccording to the bride-price of virgins.\u201d This verse sets a standard. The bride-price of virgins is the same as the payment for seduction\u2014fifty shekels.", "6": "Introduction<br>In the Mishnah, R. Akiva states that a girl who has been betrothed and then divorced before marriage still receives the fine, but that since she was betrothed, she herself receives the fine, not her father. In contrast, in the baraita, he says that the father receives the fine.", "7": "The answer to the difficulty is quite simple\u2014these are indeed two different opinions, transmitted by two different people, each a different version of what R. Akiva said.", "8": "The Talmud now evaluates each of the versions of R. Akiva. The version in the mishnah, that she receives the fine, is closer to the simple meaning, because it retains a difference between a girl that was never betrothed (fine goes to father) and one that was betrothed and then divorced (fine goes to her). But the version in the baraita is far removed from the simple meaning for in either case the father receives the fine. Did the words \u201cwho was not betrothed\u201d really come just to teach a gezerah shavah, a linguistic comparison, with the verse in Exodus?", "9": "Nahman b. Yitzchak says that R. Akiva in the baraita is based on a different pronunciation of the word. Instead of \u201corasah\u201d which means \u201chas not been betrothed\u201d he reads \u201cwho is not betrothed.\u201d Thus as long as she is not currently betrothed, the father receives the fine.<br>The problem is that the verse is now too obvious. If a man rapes a girl who is betrothed, he receives the death penalty, not a fine! The answer is that were it not for the verse I might have thought that he would pay the fine and be executed. The verse therefore teaches he pays the fine only if she is not betrothed.", "10": "Rabbah holds that one can pay a fine and still be executed. So then he could not explain the verse as if it means \u201cwho is not betrothed\u201d for according to Rabbah if one rapes or seduces a betrothed virgin, he would pay the fine and be executed.<br>Therefore, Rabbah must hold like R. Akiva in the Mishnah. The verse is now read in its normal fashion\u2014she has never been betrothed. In such a case the father receives the fine. But if she was betrothed and then divorced, she receives the fine.", "11": "A baraita is cited in which two opinions dispute whether she receives the fine, or her father. R. Hisda interprets this baraita as referring to a virgin who was betrothed and then divorced and in line with the difference between R. Akiva of the Mishnah (she receives the fine) and R. Akiva of the baraita (father receives the fine).", "12": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section deals with a case where the girl who was raped or seduced dies before the fine is paid.<br>As I\u2019ve said many times, I realize that talking about these situations is disturbing. I too am disturbed when I constantly I have to describe situations in which young girls may be raped, although I am cognizant that my being disturbed does not mean that this does not occur in the real world. I do believe the rabbis were talking theoretically, envisioning scenarios and not responding to real life situations. Their discussions are clinical to a large extent, like those of a physician or mathematician. But I realize that seeing the word rape over and over is difficult. We should also note that the rabbis engage in midrash with the entire Torah, whether or not it had practical ramifications or applications in their own lives. The fine for rape or seduction was no longer a real institution that was enforced in rabbinic times.", "13": "Abaye reads the words \u201cthe girl\u2019s father\u201d as implying that if the girl dies before the father succeeds in collecting the fine, the father loses the right to the fine.", "14": "Rava asks about a case where the liability for the fine occurs (rape or seduction), then the girl dies and then before the fine is paid, she reaches the age of maturity (had she been alive). Had she been alive and then reached the age of maturity, the fine would have been hers. But do we consider her posthumously reaching the age of maturity to be the same? If we do, the fine goes to her offspring. If we do not, then the fine stays with her father."}, "74": {"0": "The Talmud goes on a small digression here about whether a girl can become pregnant while a minor. According to R. Meir she can, and therefore she should use a contraceptive device because of the danger to her health of giving birth while a minor. According to the other sages, a minor will not become pregnant because God will protect her (I wouldn\u2019t advise relying on this advice).<br>There are two other categories of women whom R. Meir allows to use contraception. A pregnant woman is the first. The rabbis seem to have believed that the pregnant woman could again be impregnated and that this could damage the already conceived fetus. A nursing woman could use contraception so that she doesn\u2019t get pregnant again and have to wean her first child too early.<br>The problem is that Rava seems to believe that a young girl can become pregnant and have a child all before reaching majority age. According to the sages in this source, that is not possible.", "1": "The girl under discussion must have been raped/seduced as a minor such that she could have a child to inherit her and then die before reaching majority age. She could not have had sex as a na\u2019arah, because there is only six months between na\u2019arut (the period in between a minor and a girl of majority age) and reaching maturity, and we know she died before reaching maturity. So again we must ask, how can a minor become pregnant?", "2": "The question is therefore adjusted. Rava asked if the father\u2019s right to the fine is lost if his daughter dies and then hits majority age before he collects. This question, for which Rava does not have an answer, is that which Abaye did know above.", "3": "Here is yet another version of the issue, this time formed in a direct question by Mar son of R. Ashi, a late amora.<br>However, there is no answer to the question. It remains undecided.", "4": "Introduction<br>Our section continues to ask questions about whether a girl\u2019s father would receive the fine under certain scenarios.", "5": "Rava asked Abaye if the girl who was raped/seduced is then betrothed before the fine is collected, does her father still receive the fine. In other words, she was not betrothed at the time of the rape/seduction, but she was betrothed before the money was collected. Does she count as a betrothed girl who does not receive the fine?", "6": "Abaye responds that the answer to this question is obvious. The Torah says that the girl was not betrothed at the time of the rape/seduction. It does not say that she can\u2019t be betrothed at the time that the husband gives the money to the father. Of course the father receives the money.", "7": "Rava now responds with a baraita that seems to prove the fault in Abaye\u2019s line of reasoning. The baraita states that if the girl is married (not just betrothed) before the fine is given to the father, she gets the fine, not her father. This is true even though the Torah does not explicitly say that the girl must not be married when the fine is given to the father. Rava in other words is saying that we cannot prove anything from the absence of such words in the verse.", "8": "Abaye rejects Rava\u2019s comparison. Marriage is like becoming of majority age\u2014she is no longer under her father\u2019s authority. Therefore, just as we have learned that if she reaches majority age before the fine is paid, she receives the fine, so too if she is married before she reaches majority age, she receives the fine. But betrothal does not remove her completely from her father\u2019s authority, for we have learned that he may still invalidate her vows. Therefore, it may be that even if she is betrothed, it is still her father who receives the fine.", "9": "Introduction<br>This introduction is from the Mishnah Yomit commentary.<br>The Torah discusses the \u201cseducer\u201d in Exodus 22:15-16:  \u201cIf a man seduces a virgin who has not been betrothed and lies with her, he must make her his wife by payment of a bride-price.  If her father refuses to give her to him, he must still weigh out silver in accordance with the bride-price for virgins.\u201d  The rabbis learned that the bride-price referred to in these verses is the same as the 50 shekels referred to in the verses which discuss the rapist in Deuteronomy 22.  Therefore, both a seducer and a rapist must pay a fine of 50 shekels to the father, equivalent to the bride-price which the father would have received had he married her off in a typical fashion.  This mishnah discusses the other types of payments that the rapist and the seducer must pay and other differences between the two.", "10": "<b>Section one:</b> The seducer pays three types of payment:  1)  for having shamed her; 2) for having caused her to be \u201cblemished\u201d; 3)  the fine. The first two of these types of payments will be described in greater detail in mishnah seven. The rapist must make an additional payment for the pain he has caused her. Since the women willingly had relations with the seducer, he does not pay for the pain.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The mishnah now relates three differences in the penalties of a seducer and those of a rapist.  The first was already mentioned above. The second is that a rapist must pay immediately, whereas the seducer pays only if he decides not to marry her.  This difference is derived from the fact that with regard to the seducer the verse states, \u201cIf her father refuses to give her to him, he must weigh out silver\u201d (Ex. 22:16).  By inference we can conclude that if the father does not refuse, then the seducer does not pay.  In contrast, Deuteronomy 22:28 states, \u201cThe man who lay with her must pay the girl\u2019s father fifty shekels of silver.\u201d  In this case the ruling is stated unconditionally.  Hence he must pay whether or not the father allows the couple to remain married.<br>The final difference is that a rapist is not allowed to initiate divorce against the woman.  This is derived from the Deut. 22:28, \u201cBecause he has violated her, he can never have the right to divorce her.\u201d  In contrast, the seducer is allowed to divorce his wife.<br>[I realize that the idea that the victim of a rape would somehow be rewarded by the rapist having to marry her and never being allowed to divorce her, sounds cruel to our modern sensibilities.  However, if we understand that we are talking about a society where a woman may have been \u201cruined\u201d and hence unable to get married after having been raped, we will realize that the intent of the law is to protect the woman.  By forcing him to marry her, the Torah affords her the economic protection of a husband, economic protection that may have been quite necessary in ancient society.]<br><b>Section three:</b>  The rapist must marry the woman whom he has raped, even if she has some physical handicap that makes him not want to marry her.  He lost his right to decide whether or not he wanted to marry her when he raped her.<br><b>Section four:</b>  However, he may not marry a woman who is halakhically forbidden to him.  After all, if this were not so, a man could rape a woman and thereby allow himself to marry a woman who would have otherwise been forbidden to him.  The mishnah lists two types of such women.  The first is a woman who \u201chas committed a licentious act\u201d.  This refers to a woman who committed adultery after he had married her.  As is always the case, a husband may not continue to live with his wife if she had committed adultery.  If in this case, the rapist married the woman and then she committed adultery, he may not remained married to her.<br>The second example is a woman who is not allowed to marry an Israelite, such as a mamzeret or a natinah.  If he raped such a woman, he may not marry her, and if he did marry her, he must divorce her.  Similarly, if he was a kohen and he raped a divorcee, he is not allowed to marry her.  This halakhah is derived from a midrashic reading of the words \u201cAnd she shall be for him a wife\u201d, which are read by the rabbis to mean that the woman must be halakhically \u201cfit\u201d to be his wife.  If she is not, he is allowed to divorce her.", "11": "Introduction<br>According to the mishnah, the rapist pays compensation for the pain. The mishnah asks what the pain is.<br>I want to warn you that this section can be particularly difficult to read. The rabbis do not consistently take into account the psychological pain of rape. For the most part, the pain they recognize is physical. This may be found disturbing because today we recognize the deep emotional pain caused by being forced to have sex.", "12": "According to Shmuel\u2019s father, the pain the rapist must compensate his victim for is not the rape itself, but for the pain of being thrown onto the ground.", "13": "Zera cites a baraita to raise a difficulty on Shmuel\u2019s father. In this baraita, R. Shimon argues that the rapist does not pay for the pain. He assumes that the pain is the pain of first intercourse. Since the woman will eventually suffer this pain when she is married, the rapist does not owe it. [I know the insensitivity of this statement is overwhelming]. The other sages answer that he must pay for the pain he causes, because one who has sex for the first time against her will is not the same as one who does so willingly. The former suffers far more physical pain, and it may be that this opinion takes into account the psychological suffering as well.<br>In any case, we can see here that the payment is for the rape itself. That is not to say that someone who inflicts other bodily harm while raping does not have to pay for that as well. What R. Zera is saying is that even if there is no other physical pain, for instance he throws her onto soft silk, the rape itself is painful and therefore must be compensated for."}, "75": {"0": "Nahman now revises what the pain payment is for. It is for the pain of forcing her to spread her legs.", "1": "Nahman now explains why the seducer does not pay for having her spread her legs. Since in the case of seduction the woman was willing, the seducer need not pay. It is as if she told him to tear up her silk garments but that she will not hold him liable.", "2": "The problem with R. Nahman\u2019s analogy is that the girl who is being seduced does not have a right to forgo this payment, for it would go to her father. This is not because he experiences the pain, but rather because all financial benefit that comes from a young girl (a na\u2019arah) goes to her father. So how can she tell the man to \u201ctear up my silk garments.\u201d<br>Nahman\u2019s final answer is that there simply is no pain for a virgin being seduced. Even though she is losing her virginity, she experiences no pain. Perhaps this is a sign that the pain paid by the rapist is for psychological pain. Since the seduced woman experiences no psychological pain (she wanted to have sex), there is no payment for pain.<br>It is interesting that R. Nahman attributes this statement to women themselves. As a man, how could he know whether women experience pain at first intercourse?", "3": "Of course it does seem that in most circumstances sex is painful for a woman during her first time, even if she is having sex willingly. So how come he does not have to compensate her in the case of seduction? Three amoraim now give answers as to how much sex hurts the first time a woman has it. They have learned these answers from various women (obviously, a man could not know how much this hurts). The point seems to be that this does not hurt any more than do other things that might happen quite frequently. Pain requires compensation only if it is abnormal pain.", "4": "Introduction<br>According to the mishnah, the rapist pays the fine immediately, whereas the seducer pays the fine only when/if he divorces her. Our sugya discusses this section of the mishnah.", "5": "The mishnah assumes that the seducer has already married her. But we seem to have skipped a step\u2014what if he does not marry her? Abaye therefore reads the mishnah differently. The seducer pays the father the fine if he does not marry her. If he marries her, then he really never does pay the fine. It just turns into the ketubah, which he will pay on divorce.", "6": "This baraita accords with Abaye in saying that the seducer pays the fine only if he does not marry her. It then goes on to give some other information. Unlike the fine, the shame and blemish payments must be paid immediately. The reason seems to be that these are not transformed by marriage into the ketubah. They are independent, a result of his not having gone through the proper channels of marriage. Therefore, he pays them immediately, regardless of whether he ends up marrying her.<br>Finally, the mishnah notes that in either case, either she or her father can refuse the marriage. As we will see below, this is not quite explicit in the Torah.", "7": "The Torah only says that the father of the seduced girl may refuse the marriage. It never says anything about refusing the marriage in the case of rape (Deuteronomy) or whether she may refuse the marriage in the case of seduction. The rabbis use midrash to derive that she may refuse in either case, but they do not derive, at least not in this midrash, that the father may refuse in the case of rape?<br>[We should note that rabbinic law is a major advancement here over Torah law. According to the rabbis a woman could never be forced to marry someone she does not want to, unless her father is marrying her off when a minor.]", "8": "Abaye and Rava both provide reasons why the father may reject the marriage in either case. According to Abaye, the father has a right to reject the marriage so that the sinner (the rapist) may not be rewarded by being able to marry the girl he raped.<br>Rava offers a fairly straightforward argument. If the father of the seduced girl is allowed to refuse the marriage even though the seducer acted only against the will of the father, the father of the raped girl should all the more so be allowed to reject the marriage, for the rapist acted against both of their will.", "9": "Since both Rava and Abaye give decent reasons as to why the father has a right to refuse, the Talmud now asks why each amora did not give the other\u2019s answer.<br>Rava did not give Abaye\u2019s answer because once the rapist has paid the fine, he really is not in the position of a sinner gaining a pure advantage. He has lost out by having to pay the fine.", "10": "Abaye says that we can\u2019t really compare the situations of the rapist and the seducer with regard to the right of the father to refuse. When it comes to the seducer, the seducer himself is not obligated to marry her. Therefore, the father does not have the right to reject the marriage. This would destroy the \u201ckal vehomer\u201d and we could say that in the case of the rapist, since the rapist is forced to marry her (if she agrees), so too the father cannot reject the marriage.", "11": "The rapist must pay the fine immediately. It is not transformed into a delayed payment as it is for the seducer. However, the corollary is that when he divorces her, he does not pay the ketubah, because he already paid it. The problem with this law is that the rapist is not allowed to divorce her, unless she requests a divorce. So the Talmud emends it to read that if she requests a divorce, she does not receive a second ketubah.", "12": "As I stated before, according to the first opinion, her fine becomes her ketubah. She received her payment up front and not as a delayed payment. If he dies, she does not receive anything more.<br>Yose son of R. Judah says that he must give her an additional ketubah of one maneh, which is 100 zuz. This is the ketubah given for the widow or divorcee in all cases.", "13": "The Talmud explains the dispute between the rabbis and R. Yose. The rabbis hold that the reason for a ketubah is to serve as a deterrent for divorce. Since the rapist is not allowed to initiate divorce, there is no reason for such a deterrent. Therefore, if he dies, she still does not receive a ketubah. The other rabbis hold that if there is no deterrent, the rapist who eventually married the woman would torment her to convince her to ask for a divorce. Therefore, he needs a deterrent as well. Since she gets a ketubah if he divorces her, she also receives one if he dies.", "14": "The mishnah ruled that a rapist must marry the woman even if he does not want to. [Only she or her father may refuse the marriage]. But the seducer need not marry her. Rava asks why there is a difference, when in general the rabbis learned the laws of one case from the other. R. Ashi answers that there is a special midrash on Exodus, the passage the rabbis interpret as referring to the seducer. But this word \u201cto be his\u201d is not found in Deuteronomy. Therefore the rapist has no right to refuse the marriage. He must \u201cdrink from his pot.\u201d"}, "76": {"0": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf begins by discussing the mishnah\u2019s ruling that the rapist does not marry the victim if she is prohibited to him, i.e. she is a mamzeret.", "1": "Kahana argues that the positive commandment of \u201che shall marry her\u201d should outweigh the negative prohibition of not marrying a woman prohibited to him. We should note that it is not uncommon for a positive commandment to outweigh a negative one.", "2": "Zevid clarifies that a positive commandment supersedes a negative one only if the positive commandment must be performed, and observance of the negative commandment would make the positive commandment completely impossible. Such would be the case if one the spot where circumcision must be performed there was scale disease. It is prohibited in general to cut off scale disease through surgery, but in this case, if one observed this negative commandment, there would be no way to perform the positive one. So circumcision wins out. But in the case of the rapist, she has the right to refuse the marriage. So this is not a case of a positive commandment being prevented by a negative one. It is only a potential positive commandment.", "3": "Introduction<br>The mishnah which opens today\u2019s section teaches that if the girl herself receives the fine, then she only receives it if she is raped.  If she consents to having relations with the man, he does not pay the fine.", "4": "In the case in this mishnah the fine surely would go to the girl, for her father is no longer alive.  In fact, as we shall see the Talmud explains that the despite the fact that the mishnah refers to an orphan, this mishnah actually refers to any girl who was betrothed and then divorced or widowed, and that the mishnah is according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva in the earlier mishnah who stated that a girl who was betrothed and then divorced still receives the fine, but she gets it, not her father. A girl who was betrothed and then divorced is called \u201can orphan while her father is still alive\u201d because once she is betrothed, she is out of her father\u2019s domain.  In this case, if she was seduced then the man does not pay the fine because she consented.", "5": "According to R. Yohanan this mishnah accords with R. Akiva who said that if a girl was betrothed and then divorced, a subsequent fine for rape goes to her, not to her father.", "6": "The Talmud now shows how R. Yohanan derives from this mishnah that R. Elazar and R. Akiva agree. This mishnah cannot be referring to a real orphan. Obviously her father would not receive her fine\u2014she has no father. Rather, this mishnah refers to a girl who was betrothed and then divorced before reaching majority age. At times the Talmud even calls her \u201can orphan in the life of her father\u201d because her father no longer has any authority over her. According to both R. Akiva and R. Elazar she still receives the fine, but it goes to her.", "7": "The halakhah follows R. Elazar. It is interesting to note that this is one of the only halakhic rulings in this chapter. If, as I have said on many occasions, these laws were not practical halakhah, why was there a need for a halakhic ruling in this particular case? The answer probably is that there is a paradigm here. Once a girl has been betrothed, she is no longer in her father\u2019s domain. While this may not have had practical implications with regard to the laws of fines, which were not practiced by this period, it does have practical implications in other areas of halakhah.", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins with a mishnah that lists the three types of payment that a seducer must pay.", "9": "<b>Section one:</b>  Embarrassment is relative to the social standing of the woman and the man.  The higher the social standing of the woman, the higher this payment will be, and the lower the social standing of the man, the higher the payment will be.  Others explain that a man of higher social standing will pay a greater payment because he embarrasses the woman more.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The blemish of a woman raped is calculated the same way that blemishes caused by other types of injury are calculated.  An estimate is made how much she would have been worth as a slave sold on the market before she had relations (either by seduction or rape) and how much she was worth afterwards.  This is the same way that an estimate would be made for a payment for blemish if, for instance, someone cut off someone else\u2019s hand.  What is somewhat puzzling is why a virgin slave would be worth more than a non-virgin slave.  The Talmud supposes that a master may want to purchase a female virgin slave on behalf of his trustworthy male slave, one whom he might want to \u201creward\u201d.<br><b>Section three:</b>  Any fine that is given a fixed sum in the Torah, is fixed and can never be raised or lowered.  Such is the case with the bride-price.  Therefore, a seducer will pay a fine of 50 shekels whether he has relations with a poor girl or with the daughter of a king.  Other examples of fixed sums in the Torah are an ox that kills a slave (Exodus 21:32) and a husband who makes a false virginity claim against his wife (Deut. 22:19)....", "10": "The Torah sets the fine for rape (and by extension seduction) at 50 selas. But the rabbis read this as only one of the payments a rapist/seducer pays. He must also pay the shame and blemish (and in case of rape, pain). The question is\u2014how do they know this? Maybe the 50 selas should cover all the various aspects of the damage he has done?<br>Zera answers that the payment should reflect the social status of the woman seduced/raped. A fine that is the same for all women would not reflect this. While this sounds harsh to our ears (to mine too), we would do well to remember that this payment is in essence, the bride-price paid in advance. Put in those terms, we can more easily understand that not all bride-prices would have been the same. Today this might be reflected in wedding costs. Wealthy people have more expensive weddings than do the poor.", "11": "According to the Torah, someone who accidentally kills a slave pays 30 selas. This payment is fixed. But, Abaye argues, if R. Zera\u2019s logic was right, then the payment for the slave should vary depending on his abilities. If he is a slave able to do high level work with jewelry, the one who accidentally kills him should have to pay higher compensation to the master."}, "77": {"0": "Zera offers another reason offers another reason why the 50 is only for the fine and not for all the payments. R. Zera refers to a situation where a woman first had \u201cunnatural intercourse\u201d (anal). If she was then seduced and had normal intercourse, the seducer would pay 50 shekels, even though she had already had intercourse. This would be no different from a case where a man seduces a virgin who has never had any type of intercourse. R. Zera believes that the payment of \u201cshame\u201d should reflect that. Put quite frankly, the woman who had never had intercourse would receive a higher \u201cshame\u201d payment for her shame is greater.", "1": "Abaye again retorts that the payment for accidentally killing a slave is the same no matter whether the slave is healthy or sick.<br>The essence of Abaye\u2019s argument highlights the difference between the slave payment and the fine for rape or seduction. The rabbis viewed this fine as only one part of the payment the man makes for injuring her. In essence, they viewed rape (and seduction) as personal injury, and therefore added in the payments for personal injury. But the payment for killing a slave they left as the only compensation.", "2": "Abaye and Rava both find ways of reading the verses in Deuteronomy 22:29 as if they imply that the fine is only for the \u201claying\u201d with her. But since he also shamed her and blemished her, he must also pay for those elements as well. These are \u201cmidrashim\u201d\u2014they are not the simple understanding of the verse. But when R. Zera fails to logically prove that he must pay for shame and blemish, the other amoraim are left to offer midrashic justification.", "3": "The Talmud now asks why the father receives these payments. After all, she was the one shamed and blemished. The initial answer is derived from a verse in Numbers which is read as if it states that all benefits that she gets when a youth (till 12.5 years) go to her father.", "4": "But what about that which R. Huna said in the name of Rav: From where do I know that a daughter\u2019s handiwork belongs to her father? As it is said, \u201cAnd if a man sell his daughter to be a slave\u201d, just as the handiwork of a slave belongs to her master so does the handiwork of a daughter belong to her father.\u201d Why do I need this? Let him derive it from \u201cBeing in her youth in her father\u2019s house\u201d? Rather that text was written in connection only with the annulment of vows?<br>Rav derived the halakhah that all handiwork produced by a young girl goes to her father from a verse that teaches that a father may sell his daughter into slavery (this was entirely theoretical by this period). This is another case of a father receiving financial benefit from his daughter. But the question is, why didn\u2019t Rav use the verse from Numbers to prove that a girl\u2019s handiwork goes to her father? The answer is that that verse refers only to a father\u2019s ability to annul his daughter\u2019s vows. This is indeed the context of the verses.", "5": "The Talmud now rejects deriving the law that the father receives the shame and blemish payments from two other payments/rights he does receive. We cannot argue that since he has the right to annul her vows he receives the payments, for in general we do not derive monetary laws from ritual matters. Annulling vows is considered a ritual matter. Second, we cannot derive it from the fact that he receives the fines, because we do not learn compensatory payments from fines.", "6": "The naked truth of the matter is that the father could shame her by marrying her off to a scoundrel or one with boils. Since he has the right to \u201cshame\u201d her in a sense, he receives the payment.<br>In the end, I think the real reason he receives the money is that he is in a sense shamed by her being raped or seduced. While today we think of all human beings as individuals, there are still cultures in which the \u201cviolation\u201d of a female member of the family is considered to be a dishonor to all members of the family. This is why the father receives the payment, at least when she is young and still a member of his household. ", "7": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section explains the \u201cblemish\u201d payment. I should again reiterate that this payment comes from the laws of personal injury and is similar to the \u201cnezek\u201d or \u201cdamages\u201d payment from the eighth chapter of Bava Kamma.", "8": "The mishnah teaches that to assess the blemish payment, they would assess the woman\u2019s previous and current slave value. This makes sense with regard to general injury. For instance, if someone cut off my hand, the blemish (i.e. damage) payment is how much I would be worth as a slave with my hand and how much without. This would depend on what my abilities were before and whether I could still perform them). However, when it comes to the woman who was raped or seduced, the payment seems a bit strange and out of place\u2014how much more would a man pay to have a virgin female slave than a non-virgin one?", "9": "The Talmud offers that precise objection\u2014why should an owner prefer a virgin slave? [The notion that he wants to have relations with her is not raised, for this is forbidden. In reality, I think it is understandable, albeit immoral, why a male owner might prefer a virgin slave]. The final answer is that he might want to marry her off to his own male slave, one whom he favors and therefore wants to find a virgin wife.", "10": "Introduction<br>According to Exodus 21:7 a father has the right to sell his daughter into slavery.  In interpreting this verse, the rabbis limited this right to when she is a minor, meaning before she both achieves puberty and reaches the age of 12 years [that is to say, one who has reached puberty but is not yet 12 or is 12 but has not reached puberty is still considered a minor].  After this age she is considered a \u201cyoung woman\u201d (na\u2019arah) and her father may no longer sell her.  It is at this age that if she is raped or seduced her father receives a fine.  The period in which a woman is considered a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d can be no longer than six months.  After this period, she has reached what was considered to be majority age, and there is no fine incurred by one who rapes or seduces her.", "11": "When a girl is of an age where her father may sell her, according to our mishnah one who rapes or seduces her does not incur a fine.  This is learned exegetically from the fact that Deuteronomy 22:28 which discusses the fine for rape uses the word \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d.  The mishnah concludes that only one who rapes or seduces a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d incurs the fine and not one who does so to a minor.<br>Finally, six months after becoming a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d a girl becomes a \u201cbogeret\u201d, one who has reached majority age.  At this point her father loses most of his rights vis a vis her.  He can no longer marry her off or sell her.  She is legally independent.  One who rapes or seduces her does not incur a fine.", "12": "Rav Judah notes that the mishnah above accords with R. Meir only. The other sages hold that there is overlap between the laws of the sale and the applicability of the fine. Basically, until she is of majority age the fine applies. She may only be sold before she is a na\u2019arah. So the overlap is that both sets of laws apply until she is a na\u2019arah.", "13": "Introduction<br>According to R. Meir, a minor girl does not receive a fine if she is raped or seduced. Today\u2019s section discusses why he holds this why.", "14": "Hisda explains that R. Meir bases his law on the words \u201cshe shall be for him.\u201d This implies that the verse refers only to a girl who can arrange her own marriage. This is true only for a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d a girl between the ages of 12 and 12 \u00bd. A minor does not receive the fine.<br>The other rabbis say that the word \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d implies that all girls receive a fine, up to and including the age of \u201cna\u2019arah.\u201d", "15": "In this section we learn of a different tradition about what Resh Lakish said. Instead of the earlier tradition, here Resh Lakish refers to a man who falsely claims that his wife was not a virgin at the time of her marriage. The Torah refers to a na\u2019arah. From here Resh Lakish said that if the man falsely accused a minor, he is not punished by having to pay the 100 shekels. [Again, by the time of the rabbis, this law was entirely theoretical.] We have not yet concluded the idea that this is the same tradition as above.", "16": "Adda b. Ahavah raises a difficulty on this second teaching of Resh Lakish. Resh Lakish implies that if the Torah had not called her a \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d we would have applied the whole chapter to a minor. But this is impossible, because later in the chapter we learn that if the husband\u2019s claim is true (according to rabbinic interpretation this means that she committed adultery) she is executed. But minors cannot be punished. Therefore, the chapter must refer only to a na\u2019arah.", "17": "The Torah used the word \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d here. But it didn\u2019t need to. We could have figured this out on our own, because it could not have referred to a minor. This implies that anywhere else the Torah uses the word \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d it includes a minor as well. This now is the same statement that Resh Lakish said above about the fine. Even though the Torah used the world \u201cna\u2019arah\u201d it meant even a minor."}, "78": {"0": "Introduction<br>The concept taught in the mishnah found at the beginning of this daf is that one who admits of his own accord that he has committed a crime, without before having evidence brought against him, is exempt from paying the fine.

If he slaughtered or sold the animal he must pay back four or five times its value.  The double, fourfold and fivefold payments are fines, whereas the restitution for the principal is not a fine.  Therefore, if a man admits to having stolen something, he only pays the principal.<br><b>Section three:</b>  If a person\u2019s ox kills someone or someone else\u2019s ox, the ox owner must make financial restitution (see Exodus 21:30).  This is not considered a fine and therefore if a person admits that his ox killed another ox or a human being, he must make restitution.  However, if an ox kills a slave there is an automatic penalty of 30 shekels (see Exodus 21:32).  Since this is a fixed sum, a person who admits that his ox did so is not liable to pay the fine.<br><b>Section four:</b>  The mishnah now sums up what we learned above.  If a person is liable to pay a fine that is more than the actual damage, or actually a sum that is set arbitrarily and is independent of the damage, he doesn\u2019t pay upon his own admission.  The reasoning behind this may be that fines are in order to prevent the person from committing another crime.  Therefore, if he comes forward and admits to what he has done (and it was not otherwise known) the need for a penalty does not exist.  On the other hand compensation is needed for the loss incurred by the victim and therefore compensatory penalties are paid in any case.", "2": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now begins to deal with the mishnah we learned yesterday.", "3": "The mishnah gives the example of a man who admits that \u201cI have seduced so-and-so\u2019s daughter.\u201d It does not deal with the case where he states, \u201cI have raped.\u201d Why not?<br>The Talmud answers that if he says \u201cI have raped\u201d it is obvious that he must pay her. There is no shame to the woman\u2019s character when he declares that he raped her\u2014she was an innocent victim. Therefore, since he does not defame her, he must pay her compensation. But I might have thought that when he says \u201cI seduced her\u201d he should not be believed, because by believing him, her character is defamed as well. After all, she is being accused of having willingly slept with him. Therefore, the mishnah teaches that he is believed, despite the fact that believing him will in some way defame her character.", "4": "Shimon says, against the Mishnah, that if a man states that he seduced so-and-so\u2019s daughter, he is not believed, for this would defame the daughter.

We cannot allow him to defame her because even if she doesn\u2019t mind, she will be tarnished in someone else\u2019s mind. On the one hand, this approach guards a person\u2019s reputation.

This sets up a paradigm\u2014one who confesses pays any payment considered compensation, but he does not pay anything considered a penalty.<br>Today\u2019s sugya begins a relatively well-known discussion over whether the payment of half damages is considered a fine or compensation. Half damages are what the owner of an animal pays if his animal damaged in an unusual or unexpected manner. For instance, if an ox that has never gored before, gores. This is discussed in the beginning of Bava Kamma.", "7": "Papa and R. Huna son of R. Joshua disagree over the status of the payment of half damages. R. Papa holds that they are really compensation. In reality, a person who\u2019s ox damaged something should pay the full amount, because he should have known that oxen are dangerous. They cannot really be guarded. But since this was the ox\u2019s first (or second) time damaging, and they had not yet become an attested danger, the Torah had mercy on him and obligated him to pay only half damages. In short, he should have paid full, but he is allowed to pay half.", "8": "Huna holds that half-damages are a type of penalty. Really, the owner should not have been liable to pay anything, because cattle are safe. But the Torah penalizes him by making him pay half damages in order to incentivize him to guard his cattle. In short, he should have paid nothing, but he is penalized into paying half.", "9": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section begins a series of difficulties and supports for the positions of R. Papa and R. Huna from yesterday\u2019s section\u2014are half damages considered compensation (R. Papa) or a penalty (R. Huna)?", "10": "The sugya opens with a mnemonic device to help remember the order of the difficulties that are to be raised.<br>The first difficulty is a mishnah from Bava Kamma which teaches that both the plaintiff and the defendant share in the costs of the loss of the damages. This works for R. Papa, who holds that half damages are compensation. The plaintiff loses half of the money that really should be owed to him, so he too shares in the costs. But to R. Huna, who holds that half damages are a penalty, how does the plaintiff share in the costs\u2014he really should not be receiving any payment whatsoever.", "11": "The answer is that the plaintiff shares in the loss if the value of the carcass decreases. When one ox kills another ox, the plaintiff owes the defendant the difference in value (or half the difference) between the dead ox and what it was worth when it was alive. So if the carcass is worth 50 and the live ox 200, the defendant will owe either 150 or 75, depending on whether the goring ox was an attested or unattested danger. If subsequently the value of the live ox is reduced, this loss goes to the plaintiff. This, according to R. Huna, is how he shares in the costs.", "12": "The problem is that we already have a baraita that teaches that the owners of the dead ox must deal with the carcass\u2014i.e. if it goes down in value, the loss is theirs. So why would we need another mishnah to teach the same thing.<br>The answer is that one source refers to a mu\u2019ad (an animal that is an attested danger) and the other to a tam (an unattested danger). We need both sources, the Talmud explains, lest we think that the rule that the defendant is responsible for the carcass applies only in one of these cases. It might refer only to the tam, because we might have not penalized the goring ox\u2019s owner by making him take care of the carcass and absorb any loss in its value, since his ox had not yet been warned. On the other hand, it might refer only to the mu\u2019ad, since the goring ox\u2019s owner pays full compensation. This might have led us to think that he also must cover losses to the value of the carcass. Therefore we need both sources to teach us that the plaintiff always covers the loss of value to the carcass. This is how he too can at times share in the losses, and resolves R. Huna.", "13": "The mishnah quoted here teaches one difference between a tam and a mu\u2019ad. For payments caused by damage by a tam, the owner pays from the value of the offending ox\u2019s body\u2014payments cannot go beyond what that ox is worth. But when it comes to the mu\u2019ad who pays full damages, the defendant pays from his own estate.<br>If R. Huna was correct, that half damages are a penalty, the mishnah should have listed another difference. If the owner of a tam admits on his own accord that his ox damaged, he doesn\u2019t pay, because we know that one who admits to owing a fine is not liable to pay the fine. But if the owner of a mu\u2019ad admits that his ox damaged, he would owe the money because this is compensation, not a fine.", "14": "The answer the Talmud gives is that the teacher of the mishnah did not teach all of the differences between a tam and a mu\u2019ad, just some. Since he left out at least one other difference, we can assume that he may have left out the difference mentioned above.<br>To prove this, the Talmud must now find a third difference between a tam and mu\u2019ad. This difference is with regard to killing a person and paying the ransom, the value, of the person. The mu\u2019ad would pay the ransom and the tam would not (this is derived from a midrash in Bava Kamma).<br>The Talmud answers that this might not really be an omission in the mishnah, because the mishnah might follow R. Yose the Galilean who holds that the tam does indeed pay half the ransom, just as the mu\u2019ad does. So in the end, we don\u2019t know if this mishnah is a difficulty on R. Huna. R. Huna could hold like the tanna who teaches that the tam does not pay the ransom at all, in which case this Mishnah is not an exhaustive list of differences between the tam and mu\u2019ad."}, "79": {"0": "Introduction<br>In the last section of this chapter, the Talmud continues with difficulties on R. Huna\u2019s position, that half damages are a penalty and not compensation. To recall, the ramification of this is that if someone admits on his own accord that his tam (unattested danger) ox damaged, he does not pay, because one is not liable to pay a fine based solely on his own admission.", "1": "This is a quote of the mishnah, which states explicitly that if a person testifies that his ox killed a person or another ox, he is obligated to pay. If this refers to a tam, whose owner would have to pay half damages, then this would be a difficulty on R. Huna. Therefore, the Talmud says that it refers only to a mu\u2019ad, whose owner pays full damages, which are a form of compensation and not a penalty.", "2": "If the mishnah is referring only to a mu\u2019ad, the implication would be that if the animal is a tam, the owner does not pay based on his own admission. But if this is so, the mishnah should have said so outright, instead of drawing the distinction it does draw between a case where a ox kills a free person and a case where ox that kills a slave (the owner pays 30 shekels, a fine and not compensation).<br>The answer is that the mishnah prefers to deal with a mu\u2019ad, to teach us that in the case of a mu\u2019ad that kills a slave the owner does not pay based on his own admission. Had the mishnah taught the distinction between a tam and a mu\u2019ad, we might not have known this.", "3": "The last clause of the mishnah provides a general rule\u2014if the payment is more than the damages, he does not pay based on his own testimony. This clause would lead to the inference that if the payment is less than the damages, i.e. half damages, then he does pay based on his own testimony. This is against R. Huna. But the Talmud rejects that inference, instead inferring that if the payment does not correspond exactly to the damages, then he does not pay based on his own testimony. Again, R. Huna\u2019s position that half damages are a penalty is resolved, at least temporarily.", "4": "If the mishnah had meant to say that only the payment is equivalent to the damages he pays based on his own testimony then instead of saying \u201cwhoever pays more\u201d does not pay based on his own testimony it should have stated, \u201cwhoever does not pay an amount corresponding to the actual cost of the damage he has done does not pay based on his own testimony.\u201d The fact that the mishnah does not use these words is indeed a refutation of R. Huna.", "5": "The Talmud is perplexed. How can R. Huna be refuted and yet the halakhah follow his opinion that half damages are a penalty? The answer is that R. Huna was refuted by the fact that the mishnah did not teach, \u201cwhoever does not pay an amount corresponding to the actual cost of the damage he has done does not pay based on his own testimony.\u201d But the mishnah could not have taught this, for even R. Huna would say that there is one case where half damages are compensation\u2014the case of damage by pebbles. This is a type of indirect damages. The defendant pays half damages not because the offending animal was an unattested danger, but because the damages were indirect.", "6": "There is a principle that in Babylonia, or more precisely, outside of the land of Israel, fines are not collected. The idea is that the rabbis of Babylonia do not have the authority to do so. So if half damages are a fine, then they may not be collected in Babylonia. So if dogs eat lambs or cats eat big hens, both of which are unusual, payment may not be collected. But if they eat smaller animals, then the owner would be liable for full damages, and payment could be collected.", "7": "The Talmud seems to realize that there is a problem with not allowing the plaintiff to receive compensation for the property that was damaged. Therefore they find some alternatives to force the defendant to pay. First of all, if the plaintiff simply seizes the compensation, the court does not take it away from him. Second, if the plaintiff demands that the defendant go with him to court, the court in Babylonia sets a date for them to go. If the defendant does not go, he would either have to pay up, or be put under the ban.", "8": "Finally, one may not keep animals that are hazardous (or other hazards) to others in his house. If he does not must remove them he will be placed under the ban. This is derived from the verse that commands a person to set up a guard rail around his roof so that no one falls off.

It reminds me of that book \u201cZoom.\u201d In Daf Shevui we zoom in on the details, but if we could see the overall structure of the rhetorical arguments, how the Talmud thoroughly examines every possible angle for every possible general principle, checking where it is derived from, where it is applicable, and whether it contradicts tradition, we would get a better sense of just how systematic this chapter really is.<br>The first half of the next chapter, which we will begin tomorrow, continues to deal with the same subject.

This is because once the case was tried it is as if the father had already collected, even though he may not actually have collected.  In essence the rapist or seducer owes the father money.  Since this is so, when he dies, the seducer or rapist pays the money to the brothers, the father\u2019s inheritors.<br>However, if the father died before the case was tried, the money belongs to her.

Shevuot is about the consequences of making a false oath.<br>This mishnah teaches that in order for one who makes a false oath to be liable to bring a sacrifice he must deny something to which if he had admitted would have caused him to be liable. Since he is not liable to pay a fine for a self-admission, he is not liable if he denies owing a fine. He is liable only if he denies owing something which is considered financial compensation.", "5": "In the scenario in our mishnah a man approaches another man and accuses him of having raped or seduced his daughter and therefore owing him the 50 shekels, plus the other penalties we have learned about in the earlier mishnayot. The person responds that he didn\u2019t do so, and then when the claimant adjures him (makes him take an oath), he affirms the adjuration. According to the first opinion in the mishnah, when he admits that he did in fact rape or seduce the other man\u2019s daughter, he will be liable for a sacrifice for his false oath.  Of course he will also be obligated to pay the fine and the other financial penalties.<br>Rabbi Shimon disagrees.  Since there is a rule in Jewish law, that one who admits to a crime does not have to pay the fine for having done so, even if this person had admitted to having raped or seduced the daughter, he would not have been obligated to pay the fine.  Therefore, there was no denial of money, and the laws of the oath of deposit do not apply.<br>The Sages respond to Rabbi Shimon that although one who admits to a crime does not have to pay a <b>fine</b>, he does have to <b>pay compensatory damages</b>, which in this case include the payment for embarrassment and the payment for having decreased her value (blemish). Since if he had admitted he would have had to pay, he did deny money, and is therefore liable for having sworn a false oath of deposit.", "6": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section discusses the mishnah from Shevuot.", "7": "In the mishnah from Shevuot, R. Shimon said that if the person falsely denies raping or seducing and then takes an oath and then admits that he was lying, he does not bring a sacrifice because even if he did admit to having raped or seduced he would not be liable to pay the fine. A person is not liable to pay a fine if the only evidence that he committed the crime was his admission.<br>Abaye presents a more complicated scenario. The accusation is not just that he raped or seduced, but that he was convicted and ordered to pay money and the accused denied even having been convicted. The question really is\u2014if a person admits to having been convicted of having to pay a fine, is he obligated to pay that fine. If so, he would have to bring the sacrifice if he denies the crime. Or is he not obligated, just as one who admits to having committed a crime that makes him liable for a fine is not obligated to pay that fine.", "8": "Rabbah answers that since he has been tried and convicted, it is a monetary obligation and he must bring a sacrifice for his false oath. What this also means is that if a person admits to having been convicted of owing a fine, he must pay that fine. The idea is that once he was convicted, he has a debt to pay the fine. So he is really admitting to owing a debt. This is different from admitting to having committed a crime for which one owes a fine in the first place, which is really a form of self-incrimination and is therefore not accepted.", "9": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section Rabbah stated that if person swore that he had not been convicted in court of a crime for which he is liable for a fine, and then he admitted that he had been convicted, he must bring the sacrifice for a false oath. This is because this is not considered admitting to a fine. It is considered admitting to being convicted of owing money for having been convicted of a crime. Today\u2019s section continues to deal with this subject. This is a complicated section, so beware.", "10": "This baraita lists several halakhot that are fines 1) Rape or seduction; 2) Killing a slave\u2014the payment is 30 shekels, no matter how much the slave is worth; 3) Knocking out the tooth or putting out the eye of a slave\u2014the slave goes free. Note that in none of these cases is there a quid pro quo evaluation of the damage done. The fine or freedom for the slave is not necessarily equivalent to the damage done. If a person swore falsely that he had not done one of these crimes and then admitted to his false oath he is not liable to bring a sacrifice. This is because these are not like the cases listed in the Torah which are all compensation. For instance if one denies that one took a deposit from someone else and then admits that he did, he owes whatever the value of that deposit is. These are called \u201ccompensation\u201d (literally money)."}, "81": {"0": "Abaye here completes his difficulty on Rabbah by assuming that the baraita refers to a case where the person who raped/seduced, killed a slave or knocked out a slave\u2019s tooth or eye had already been tried and convicted. This would reject Rabbah who said in such a case he does bring a sacrifice for swearing falsely.<br>But the Talmud for the moment deflects that criticism and states that the baraita refers more simply to a case where a person had not yet been tried. This was not the case Rabbah was referring to.", "1": "The Talmud will now try to use the first clause of the baraita to prove that the entire baraita refers to a case where a person has already stood trial, but at first falsely swears that he has not been convicted and then admits that he has.<br>The baraita refers to three cases: 1) a thief who must pay the double payment, or if he slaughtered or sold the animal, a four or five fold payment; 2) the rapist and seducer; 3) one who falsely claims that his wife was not a virgin.<br>The baraita seems to say that if a person denies any of these debts and then admits to them, he must bring a sacrifice.", "2": "The baraita must refer to a case of a person who had already been tried in court because no one is ever liable for the twofold (or fourfold or fivefold) payments until he is convicted in court. If someone simply admits to having stolen, he pays back the principle and no more. And therefore, if the first clause refers to a case where one has been convicted, the second clause must also refer to a similar case.", "3": "Rabbah offers here a potential solution that he will reject. R. Shimon holds that when one denies owing a fine and then admits to it, he is obligated to bring a sacrifice. This would allow us to say that the first clause refers to one who had already been tried, but that the second clause refers to one who had not been tried. R. Shimon would then say that if one had already been tried and convicted, and then denied and then admitted, he would bring the sacrifice. In the last clause he would be exempt because he had not yet been convicted.", "4": "However, Rabbah admits that this would not be a good resolution because Abaye could respond that if the whole baraita is the opinion of R. Shimon, then why is his name found at the beginning of the second clause (see above). Rather, it seems clear that the first clause is the rabbis and the second clause is R. Shimon. These two positions disagree but they both refer to the same case\u2014where one has been tried and then convicted.", "5": "Rabbah now offers his albeit complicated solution to the baraita. First of all, the whole baraita refers to a case where the person had already been tried and convicted and then denied owing the fine. However, the first half is the rabbis and the second half is R. Shimon who would hold that even though he had been tried he still does not bring a sacrifice, because R. Shimon holds that one never brings a sacrifice for denying owing a fine. This is true even if he had already been convicted and then denied being convicted and then admitted it. When Rabbah said that this was compensatory he did not mean that the one who denied and then admitted would be liable to bring a sacrifice. All he meant was that if the father of the girl died after the rapist/seducer had been convicted but before the money had been collected the money goes to the inheritors and not to her. If we had considered it a fine, it would not have been considered part of the father\u2019s estate and when the father is no longer around, the sons would not inherit it. Rather it would go to her as if the father had died before the conviction had occurred.", "6": "Introduction<br>Yesterday\u2019s section concluded with Rabbah saying that if the father of the girl died after the rapist/seducer had been convicted but had not yet paid, the money would go to the brothers and not to her. This contradicts, as we shall see, our mishnah.", "7": "The mishnah clearly states that if the father dies before collecting the payments from the rapist/seducer, they go to the daughter. They are not bequeathed as an inheritance to the sons. So how can Rabbah have said that they are?", "8": "Evidently this difficulty was a thorny one and couldn\u2019t be resolved for twenty-two years, until R. Joseph became head of the yeshiva.  R. Joseph basically said that this was a special case due to a midrash on the word \u201cshall give (\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05df)\u201d found in Deuteronomy 22. If the father does not collect these payments they do not belong to him and when he dies he would not bequeath them to his inheritors. Therefore, Rabbah\u2019s statement that a person bequeaths uncollected fines to his inheritors was only in reference to other fines (such as for killing a slave).", "9": "Joseph cited a midrash based on the word \u201cvenatan\u201d\u2014the father is not considered to be legal owner of the fines until he takes possession of the money. This distinguished the fine for rape/seduction from other fines. But a word from the same root is used in connection with the fine for accidentally killing a slave. So why would Rabbah say that in that case he does bequeath the uncollected fine to his inheritors and therefore it is considered compensation and not a fine, at least with regard to the obligation to bring a sacrifice for a false oath.<br>The answer is that although the words come from the same root, they are still different roots.", "10": "If the fine of rape and seduction is different from all other fines, instead of using the midrash on the word \u201cand he denied\u201d from Leviticus 5, the earlier baraita should have used the midrash on the word \u201cand he shall give\u201d from Deuteronomy 22. This would better allow us to distinguish this fine from all other fines<br>Rava says that we do need the midrash on \u201cand he denied\u201d in connection with the fine for the rapist and the seducer. According to R. Shimon, if she became adolescent (over 12 \u00bd) before the fine was collected, the fines belong to her. If she then dies, her father will inherit these fines even though she has not yet collected them. In this way, this fine is no different from other fines which become \u201cmoney (compensation)\u201d after the court has convicted the accused. Still, if the rapist/seducer denies owing this money and then admits to it in this case, he will not be liable for a sacrifice.", "11": "The earlier baraita had said that the payments for rape, seduction, and killing a slave are all fines. But what we have been saying now is that they are compensation in the case where the person was tried, convicted and then denied owing the money that the court said he owed. So why call them fines and not compensation?<br>Nahman b. Yitzchak emends the baraita to read that these are basically fines, or perhaps more accurately, they are originally fines. They can become \u201ccompensation\u201d after conviction. But earlier they are fines.", "12": "Introduction<br>This is the last section of this long sugya. As a reminder, according to Rabbah even if the rapist/seducer was convicted and then swore that he does not owe the fine and then admitted to it, he is still not obligated to bring the sacrifice for a false oath because the payment originated in a fine.", "13": "Shimon in the mishnah in Shevuot states that if a person admits to owing a fine, he does not pay the fine. But if he had been convicted, denied it and then admitted to having been convicted, clearly R. Shimon would hold that he must pay the fine\u2014after all this is not self-admission, he was convicted. So with this logic in mind, he should also have to bring a sacrifice if he denies owing this money and then admits to it.", "14": "Rabbah could explain that R. Shimon is only responding to the view of the other rabbis. To Rabbah, R. Shimon would hold that he is exempt even if he denies the debt after having been convicted. But the rabbis in the mishnah (from Shevuot) should at least agree with him that he does not bring the sacrifice based on a self-admission because one is exempt from paying a fine if the only evidence is his own self-admission."}, "82": {"0": "The other rabbis say that when the father of the raped or seduced girl demands payment from the man who admitted to the crimes, he is mainly claiming the payments for blame and blemish. Since these are compensation and not fines, the person who swore falsely is liable to bring the sacrifice, even if he admitted to his crime.<br>Note that this interpretation of the rabbis is basically the simple meaning of the mishnah.", "1": "In the mishnah R. Shimon views the case as if the father is claiming just the fine, whereas the rabbis say he is claiming just the compensatory payments for shame and blemish. But in reality,  the father is claiming both. So why do they argue with each other?<br>Papa explains that the father is focusing on the fine because the fine is fixed. He knows he will receive fifty shekels. In contrast, the payments for blemish and shame are not fixed, so the father does not know how much he is going to receive.<br>The rabbis say that he is thinking more about the payments for blemish and shame because he knows the man must pay them in all cases. The fine is less certain because the rapist/seducer will not have to pay it if he makes a voluntary admission.", "2": "Introduction<br>This week\u2019s daf begins a new topic\u2014does an orphan girl who is being sustained by her brothers (her father\u2019s inheritors) have to give over her handiwork (the proceeds of the work she does) to them, just as she would give over her handiwork to her father when he was providing for her.", "3": "On the one hand, her brothers are maintaining her just as her father maintained her. Just as her father received her handiwork, so too her brothers should receive her handiwork. On the other hand, her father maintained her out of his own funds, but her brothers are maintaining her out of her father\u2019s estate. If there is no estate, they do not have to use their own funds to maintain her. Therefore, they might not deserve her handiwork.", "4": "Sheshet answers that just as a widow being maintained out of her husband\u2019s estate must give her handiwork to the orphan inheritors, so too should a daughter being maintained from her father\u2019s estate.", "5": "The Talmud rejects the comparison. A man may not want his widow both to be sustained and to keep her handiwork. He doesn\u2019t want her to be too well provided for, at the expense of her estate. But he might want his daughter to be well provided for and therefore he might want her to keep her handiwork and be provided for.", "6": "The implication of the difficulty raised above is that a man might prefer that his daughter be provided with more sustenance than his widow. This leads to the broader conclusion that a man prefers his own flesh and blood daughter to his widow, whom he may or may not have even chosen to marry. While this makes some logical sense (and I would argue is still often true), it contradicts another baraita. This baraita talks about a case where there is a daughter and either a widow or brothers. We know that in the case of brothers, she is maintained and they must go begging. The rabbis say that the wife is like the daughter\u2014she is guaranteed sustenance and if there is not enough for everyone, the daughter would have to go begging.<br>This baraita seems to demonstrate a preference for the wife\u2014she is guaranteed sustenance whereas the daughter is not.", "7": "The resolution is that these are two different issues. When it comes to ensuring that one party does not go begging, a man prefers to make sure that his widow does not have to beg. But when it comes to receiving expansive provisions, i.e. being able to keep one\u2019s handiwork even while being maintained, the daughter is preferred.<br>This seems to me to be an attempt to resolve the difficulty and does not make a lot of logical sense. It is a good example of the Talmud\u2019s desire to resolve difficulties, even if the outcome is not intuitive.", "8": "Introduction<br>Today\u2019s section continues to deal with the question of whether a daughter who is being provided for by her father\u2019s inheritors must give them her handiwork.

Should he not collect her handiwork while he is alive, it is still his and if he dies, his sons inherit it, just as they do any of his uncollected property. The implication is that this is only the handiwork produced while the father was alive. Handiwork produced after his death would remain with the girl, even if she was being maintained. This is difficulty for R. Sheshet.", "10": "The resolution is that this mishnah refers to a case where the brothers are not providing for her.

The Hebrew slave is guaranteed maintenance as long as he is working. And all the more so a father could not say this to his daughter, or sons to their father\u2019s daughter. In all of these cases, maintenance is guaranteed.", "11": "Rabbah b. Ulla says that the mishnah refers to surplus goods she produces. If she is not being maintained by her brothers, then she may keep her handiwork and use it to feed herself. But if there is surplus, the mishnah would rule that it goes to her brothers.

Findings are collected immediately, whereas handiwork may not be collected immediately (for instance wages). So how can findings be collected later? The mishnah, Rava claims, intends to compare the two. Just as things she finds belong to her father while he is alive and after his death belong to her, so too her handiwork. After his death it belongs to her and not to her brothers, even if they are providing her with maintenance. This is refutation of R.

When her father is alive, he receives these payments, and when he dies, they go to her. But her handiwork would go to her brothers if they are maintaining her.", "17": "The problem with the above interpretation is that the compensation for pain should go to the daughter herself, not to her father. Therefore, R. Yose interprets it as referring to a wound made to her face. In such a case, her father receives at least some of the money because this is an injury to him as well, for he will have more trouble selling her or marrying her off and therefore he would receive the payment for her diminished value. [I realize that this is again troubling. Please remember, selling off one\u2019s daughter was not practiced in rabbinic times. And as far as diminishing his ability to marry her off, this would probably remain true in all societies where parents determine whom their children marry]."}, "83": {"0": "This source is basically the same as above, except here Rav\u2019s halakhah and R.

According to the first opinion in the mishnah, both ketubot belong to her.  According to this opinion, as soon as she is married, her father loses all control over her, and he cannot make any financial gains through her.  According to Rabbi Judah, the first ketubah belongs to her father, because it was written before the marriage and hence it was a debt incurred while she still lived in her father\u2019s home.  According to the other sages who respond to Rabbi Judah, the collection does not go according to when it was written, but rather her status at the dissolution of the marriage.  Since at this point she was independent, her father has no right to her ketubah.", "5": "Curiously, the mishnah describes a situation where she is first divorced and then widowed. Why not say that she was divorced twice or widowed twice? The result would seem to be the same thing.<br>The Talmud reads into this a rule that if a woman is widowed twice she can no longer remarry. This accords with Rabbi Judah Hanasi who says that once that something has happened twice, a \u201cpresumption\u201d has been created. She is \u201cpresumed\u201d to be a fatal wife, a wife who kills her husbands just by being married to them. The idea of a fatal wife was common in the ancient world, and is even found in the apocryphal work called \u201cTobit.\u201d There are other passages in the Talmud that deal with this at length.

This is true even though the ketubah was written while she was still a minor.", "9": "The new explanation is that the father receives the ketubah because it was written while she was still in her father\u2019s authority. The Talmud assumes that the ketubah would be written slightly before marriage, as it is today. In the case of the mishnah, she is still not yet a mature girl when she is married, therefore the ketubah is her father\u2019s. But if she reached maturity age before the marriage and before the ketubah was written, then the ketubah would be hers.", "10": "The Talmud asks basically when does the ketubah go into effect such that the father or wife would be able to collect from the husband\u2019s encumbered property.<br>Huna divides the minimal ketubah payment of 200 or 100 from any additional amount the husband wishes to give her. The minimal payment goes into effect immediately at betrothal, whether the husband writes the ketubah then or not. The additional payment is contingent upon the marriage proper. The collection date of this additional amount follows, therefore, the date of marriage.<br>Asi says that the date of collection for the entire ketubah follows the date of marriage. While she does collect the ketubah if she is widowed or divorced after betrothal and before marriage, she can collect only from unencumbered property.", "11": "Introduction<br>In yesterday\u2019s section R.

The extra money that the husband writes in the ketubah is collectable from encumbered property but only from the date of the marriage. This means that if the husband engages in any loans or sales after betrothal or before marriage, the woman will not be able to collect her 100 zuz from that property.", "12": "The Talmud will construe a contradiction between R. Huna\u2019s earlier ruling and the following one. If a woman has two ketubot, one larger and one smaller, she can collect the smaller one from encumbered property from the earlier of the two dates, but the larger one only from the later date. This is because we know that only one of the two ketubot is valid and that at least two hundred zuz were owed from the first date. But we cannot know if the larger ketubah was valid from the earlier date, and therefore if she wants to collect the larger ketubah, it is only from the latter date.", "13": "If R. Huna had said that she can collect the main part of the ketubah from the date of betrothal, and the additional part from the date of marriage, then why can\u2019t we look at the case of the large and small ketubah as if it was the same. She could get the 200 from the earlier date and the other 100 from the later date. Why should she sacrifice the extra 100 just because she wants to be able to collect the 200 from encumbered property from the earlier date?", "14": "The Talmud asks a rhetorical question\u2014why should she not receive the full five hundred. Why don\u2019t we imagine that he first wrote her a ketubah of 200 and then added another ketubah of 300, such that she should collect 500?<br>The answer is that that he did not write this in the correct language of adding on to an existing amount. Rather he implied that what he wanted was to give her two options\u2014if she wanted to collect from the earlier time, she could collect the two hundred zuz, but if she wants to wait and collect encumbered property from the later time, she can get 300.<br>The same would be true if he wrote her a ketubah with one amount, 300 zuz. By accepting the larger ketubah, she forgoes the lien that was created at betrothal in the amount of 200. She can collect the full amount but only from marriage.<br>This is different from an addition to the ketubah discussed by R. Huna. There he does write \u201cand I added on.\u201d Therefore, she can collect the basic amount from encumbered property from the time of betrothal.
