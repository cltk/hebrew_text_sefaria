He added for Noah [the prohibition on eating] the limb of a live animal, as it is said \"but flesh in its life its blood you shall not eat.\"  We find seven commandments.  And so was the matter in the whole world until Abraham.  Abraham came and he was commanded, in addition to these, with circumcision.  And he prayed shaharit.

And any who does not believe in him, or does not anticipate his arrival, it is not only in the other prophets that he is denying but in the Torah and in Moses our teacher; because the Torah testifies on him [the Messiah] as it says \"and Hashem your Lord will return your captives and your pitied ones, and return and gather . . . if you scattered ones are at the end of the heavens . . . and Hashem will bring them to you. (Deuteronomy 30:5)\"  And these express words in the Torah they include all of the things that were said by the hand of all of the prophets.  Even    the piece about Bilam  it is said, and there he prophesied about the two messiahs--about the first messiah who is David who saved Israel from their enemies and from the last messiah who will arise from his children who will save Israel [in the end].

This is not the point (of The Messianic redemptive process). For Rebbe Akiva, the wisest of the Mishnaic sages, was the \"weapons bearer\" of The King Ben Kuziba (aka Bar Kochba). And he said concerning him (Ben Kuziba), that he was The King Messiah. And all the sages of the generation  were in agreement until he was killed due to his sins. Since he was killed they (then) knew that he was not (the Messiah).

If he fights and is victorious and defeats all of the surrounding nations, and builds The Temple in its place, and gathers all the scattered remnants of Israel, then he is definitely the Messiah.

All of the prophets spoke of the Messiah, the redeemer of Irael and their savior, and the I gatherer of the captives, and the strengthened thier mitzvot--but this one cause Jews to be lost by the sword, and for their remnants to be scattered and humbled, and to change the Torah, and for the majority of the world to do wrong by worshiping a god other than God.

Rather, the world will behave according to its custom.  And what is written in Isaiah, \"And the wolf will live with the lamb and the tiger will lie down with the kid (Isaiah 11:6)\"  is a metaphor and a riddle.  The ideas is that Israel will dwell safely with the evil idol worshipers who are compared to a wolf and to a tiger, as it is said, \"A desert wolf will slaughter them and a tiger will keep watch over their cities (Jeremiah 5:6).\"  And everybody will return to the religion of truth and they will not steal and they will not destroy.  Rather, they will eat the permitted things together with Israel, as it is said, \"And the lion, like the herd, will eat straw (Isaiah 11:7).\"  And so too all of things like this on the topic of the Messiah are metaphors.  And in the days of the King Messiah, it will be known to all what the metaphor is about and what is hinted at by them.

It seems from the simple meaning of the words of the prophets that in the beginning of the days of the Messiah, there will be a war between Gog and Magog, and that before the war between Gog and Magog, a prophet will rise to straighten Israel out and to prepare their hearts, as it is written, \"Behold, I am sending to you Eliyah (Malachi 2:23).\"  And he is not come to make the pure impure or to make the impure pure, and not to disqualify people who have been considered 'kosher', and not to certify those of have been disqualified, rather to bring peace to the world, as it says, \"He will return the hearts of the fathers to their children (Malachi 3:24)\"  And there are those among the sages who say that before the Messiah will come, Elijah will come.  And all of these things and things like them, people wont' really know how it we be until it happens.  Because these things are not explicit in the prophets' words.  And the sages also don't have a received tradition about these things, just and interpretation of the verses.  Therefore, they argue about these things.  And in any case, there is no order to these things happening and the details of them is not necessary to the religion.  And a person should never study the tales or spend a long time on the Midrash told about these issues and things like them, and they shouldn't be made to be essential, since they bring about neither awe nor love.

And he will push those who are not descendants down to [the status of] Israel, which is why it says, \"The Governor said to them...until a Cohen arises with Urim and Tumim (Ezra 2:63)....  ...", "3": "The sages and the prophets didn't desire the days of the Messiah so that they could rule over the whole world and not so that they would dominate over the idol worshippers and not to be lifted up by the nations and not to eat, to drink, and to be merry.  Rather it was so that they would be free for [study of Torah] and its wisdom without disturbances or distractions, so that they can merit living in the world to come, as we explained in the laws of T'shuvah. ...", "4": ".And at that time there won't be any famine or war there, and there won't be jealousy or competitions, for good will be flowing freely, and all delights will be as common as dust, and the only business will be to know God.
