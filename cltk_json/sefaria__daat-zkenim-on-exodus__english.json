They had been there long before the death of Joseph. The reason that they are referred to as new arrivals was that as long as Joseph was alive they did not have to pay any taxes. As soon as he had died they became subject to normal taxation. Therefore they considered that day as if it was the day that they had arrived there.

When you accept this explanation, you do not need to consider Yocheved as having been conceived in the land of Canaan and having been born at the crossing point into Egypt. (Attributed to Rabbi Shlomoh ben Parchon) This is also the reason why their number is repeated here although the Torah had given details already when it described Yaakov\u2019s departure for Egypt in Genesis chapter 46. The purpose of repeating it here is to demonstrate the phenomenal increase in the numbers of Hebrews beginning with their arrival there. Forty male Hebrews who had arrived there increased to over 600000 in the space of 210 years.

Ed.] The six words in the verse all relating to multiplying are understood as a hint of this. If you were to think that many of these infants did not survive, the Torah writes: \u201cthey multiplied,\u201d i.e. they all grew up normally.", "3": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05dd \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9, \u201ca new king (dynasty) arose;\u201d this was the first Pharaoh. The Egyptians suggested to him to join the Hebrews politically. The king said to them, how can we do this, seeing that thus far we have prospered thanks to them? The Egyptians did not like this and removed this new king from the throne for a period of three months. After the three months had elapsed, the king told the people that he was willing to change his attitude on the subject and to oppose the Hebrews. This is why the Torah wrote the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05dd \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9, \u201ca new king;\u201d The Torah did not report that the old king had died, as is customary.(Sh\u2019mot Rabbah 1,8)", "1": "\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3, \u201cwho had not known Joseph.\u201d Rabbi Yehudah ben Levi understands this line as a parable. There was someone who insulted the picture of the King. Having gotten away with that, the following week he insulted the king himself. The new king began by insulting the Jews, and when successful, proceeded to insult the G\u2019d of the Jews. (Compare Sh\u2019mot 5,20)"}, "4": "\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5, \u201clet us try to outwit it\u201d (the Jewish nation). The numerical value of the letters in the word \u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 , is 12. What the king meant was to outsmart the twelve tribes of the Jewish people. According to Rashi, what the king meant was to outsmart the deity of the Jewish people. How did he think to accomplish this? Seeing that G\u2019d had promised never to bring another deluge, and His method is to match the punishment to the crime, he thought that by drowning Jews in water, G\u2019d would not be able to punish him appropriately. (Talmud, tractate Sotah, folio11). Our sages say that the king had three advisors who helped him figure out how to deal with the ever increasing number of Israelites. They were: Bileam, Job, and Yitro. Bileam was killed for having given the advice the king accepted. Job was subjected to severe afflictions. He had not disagreed, but kept silent on the king\u2019s proposal. Yitro who left that meeting and decided to flee, was rewarded by some of his descendants eventually being able to make their home near the Temple. (Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin, folio 106, quoting Chronicles I 2,55.) According to the Talmud there, Bileam was only thirty three years old when Pinchas killed him during the punitive campaign against Midian reported in Numbers chapter 31. Our author, not surprisingly, questions the statement in the Talmud, seeing that if Bileam had been an advisor to the Pharaoh of whom the Torah speaks here, as that conversation took place before Moses was born and Moses was 119 years old when the campaign against Midian was fought. This is why Rabbi Menachem interprets the statement that when Bileam said to Balak in Numbers 24,14 before taking his leave: \u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e2\u05e6\u05da, \u201cI will now give you an advice,\u201d and the Torah does not spell out what the advice was, but writes only what the Israelites will do to the Moabites in the distant future, that what he told him was that seeing the G\u2019d of the Jewish most detests sexual promiscuity, he should arrange for the men of the Israelites to be seduced. (Compare Sanhedrin folio 106) As to the question raised by Rabbi Moshe that this advice of Bileam has been spelled out in the history of Moses\u2019 life and been attributed there to the sorcerer Bileam, (compare a text quoted by Ibn Ezra on Exodus,2,22 and described by him as unreliable. Ed) Rabbi Menachem, quotes the Talmud tractate Zevachim folio 116 that at the time when G\u2019d was ready to give the Torah to the Jewish people, all the gentile nations assembled around Bileam, fearful that another deluge was in the offing. They based themselves on the overwhelming sounds emanating from Mount Sinai at that time, as described in Exodus 19,16. Even if you were to assume that at that time Bileam was no older than twenty years of age, and that he was killed 40 years later during the campaign against Midian, i.e. when he was 60 years old, he clearly had not yet been born when the Pharaoh in our chapter of the Torah consulted how to stop the expansion of the Israelites in Egypt. There are books in which it is claimed that the gentile nations assembled around a person known as Kemuel, whom they asked about the imminence of another deluge. This interpretation is also not plausible, seeing that Kemuel was the founding father of the nation of Aram (Genesis 22, 21, who was a contemporary of Avraham and would have been over 500 years old at his death. Besides, according to B\u2019reshit Rabbah, near the end of paragraph 57, this Kemuel is identified with Lavan, also identical with Kushan Rishatayim, i.e. Bileam. The reason given why he was also known as Kemuel, is that he rebelled against G\u2019d his Creator. This comment is also listed in Sanhedrin folio 105. Why was Bileam\u2019s father called \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8? This was because he had sexual relations with his she-ass, i.e. \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5. He was also identical with Lavan, who was also known as \u05db\u05d5\u05e9\u05df \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd, having been guilty of two sins, one in the days of Yaakov and one in the era of the Judges. From all this it is clear that he was \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc, someone of no value. This is the meaning of Job 30,11 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e4\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d9, \u201cfor the Lord has humbled me.\u201d In the version by the Massoretes, the word \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 is spelled \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5, a reference to Moses\u2019 father-in-law who had been present when Pharaoh consulted with his advisers how to deal with what he considered the danger of the multiplying Hebrews. Supposedly, he was the first to respond to Pharaoh\u2019s question. This is difficult, as Job never fled, so how can we interpret the beginning of that verse in Job as applying to Yitro? We may have to answer that at that time Yitro was the most respected personage and he could have protested Pharaoh\u2019s murderous intentions, but instead he was content to simply flee Pharaoh\u2019s presence. This is why in the verse quoted Job accuses him of having failed.\n", "5": {"0": "\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e1\u05db\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea, \u201ccities for storing goods.\u201d In the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 11, there are two opinions offered concerning the word \u05de\u05e1\u05db\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea, One derives it from \u05e1\u05db\u05e0\u05d4, hazard, danger, and accordingly concludes that anyone engaging in building something endangers himself.

(Talmud Sotah, folio 11) An alternate interpretation: this interpretation takes its cue from the fact that the Torah spelled the word \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea in the singular mode instead of with the letter \u05d5, seeing that there were two women. According to the spelling there was only a single midwife, Yocheved.

This does not sound plausible, seeing that there is a whole verse between that statement and this verse. We must understand this statement as referring to something in our verse, i.e. the continued increase in the number of Hebrews. When the midwife(es) had told Pharaoh that the Jewish women were so lively that they had no need for midwives to assist them, Pharaoh had called them liars.

(Ruth, 4,7) As far as the question why Moses had to remove both his sandals, whereas Joshua had to remove only a single sandal (Joshua 5,15), the reason is that in this instance the Presence of the Spirit of G\u2019d preceded the arrival of Moses on that site, whereas in the Book of Joshua, Joshua had already been on holy soil (the land of Israel) before the appearance to him of the angel, i.e. the Spirit of G\u2019d.", "5": "\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cand this will be the sign for you (that though unworthy, now they will become worthy of redemption shortly thereafter;\u201d at that time I will make it plain to all the people that I have sent you to be their redeemer.

He had considered himself as unfit to speak with Royalty, and even if he had been worthy of that, he certainly did not deem himself worthy to take the people out of Egypt. G\u2019d reassured him, implying that he was right, but seeing He would support him all the way, he would be able to fulfill his task.

(Numbers 16,1) The answer given by our sages who were well aware of the fact that Datan and Aviram were still alive at the time when G\u2019d spoke to Moses at the burning bush, was that whereas at the time when Moses had killed the Egyptian these men were very wealthy and therefore very influential, by now they had become impoverished and frustrated old men completely devoid of any influence, i.e. not much better than the dead. Our author, after quoting the Talmud tractate Nedarim, folio 64 that not only the poor but also the blind, the ones stricken with tzoraat, and the ones not blessed with having children, are considered as if dead already, proceeds to prove that Datan and Aviram were neither blind, nor afflicted with tzoraat, nor childless.

It represents the comfort it can offer the traveler in an otherwise hostile environment. Moses is criticised for not having his priorities right, and in paying attention first to the comforts offered instead of dealing with the law to circumcise his son at the earliest opportunity, i.e. the eighth day. This seems questionable, seeing that immediately after leaving the inn the baby would be exposed to the dangers of traveling in the desert. We must therefore assume that this took place after the meeting of Moses and Aaron, when the latter had already told Moses not to expose both his wife and his family to these dangers but to let them go back to Midian. He did so although members of the tribe of Levi such as Moses and Aaron were not required to perform menial labour in Egypt. Therefore, seeing that they intended to turn back home, there was no excuse for not performing the circumcision at once.

It had become clear to her now that the problem was the delay in circumcising the infant. When she had performed the circumcision and the angel had desisted, and she had thrown the foreskin at his feet (either Moses, or the baby\u2019s), she realised that the problem had been the delay in performing this commandment.

According to the Midrash there, the members of that tribe already at the very outset, when Pharaoh \u201cinvited\u201d the people to build fortifications and show their patriotism, explained that they could not engage in such manual labour as they were destined to perform different holy tasks in the Temple in the future. They would not engage in such activities regardless of how well Pharaoh would pay them for this. They remained exempt from such labour. When Moses grew up and saw that the other tribes were forced to work seven days a week, he went to Pharaoh and explained to him that unless he gave these people at least one day of rest during each week, instead of their producing more bricks, they would fall over dead from exhaustion and produce no bricks at all. This made sense to Pharaoh, and he empowered Moses to tell the people that they could select one day of the week as their day of rest. A miracle occurred and they chose the Sabbath as their day of rest. This is why Moses was able to tell the people (Exodus 16,29) that G\u2019d had given them a day of rest on the Sabbath.

It is notable that in the Haggadah shel Pesssach, the text we read on the first night of Passover, where Rabbi Yehudah sums us the plagues on an acronym- \u05d3\u05e6'\u05da \u05e2\u05d3'\u05e9 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d7'\u05d1, and everyone asks what he contributed to our understanding of those events by doing so, that Rabbi Yitzchok son of Rabbi Asher, who was born on the same calendar date as the death of his father, so that he was given the same name as that of his late father, they applied to him the words of the verse: \u05d5\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05e9, \u201ca new sun began to shine as soon as the sun had set,\u201d (Kohelet 1,8) pointed out that when we place the three acronyms of Rabbi Yehudah one on top of the other like this: \u05d3\u05e6\u05da, \u05e2\u05d3\u05e9, \u05d1\u05d0\u05d7\u05d1                                you will find both at the beginning, the middle and the end the acronym for the three plagues of \u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, \u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05df, and \u05d7\u05e9\u05da. [Our author adds that he will not elaborate further, presumably because he had not figured out how this is arrived at by Rabbi Yitzchok. This editor remembers his father of blessed memory explaining to him, that these were the three plagues not preceded by a warning. Ed.] Rabbi Yehudah may have wished to remind the reader that the order in which the plagues occurred was the one listed in the Torah, and not the order in which the plagues are listed in the Book of psalms (chapter 105). The Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin, folio 81 [Mishnah] relates that it was customary if people had been administered 39 lashes for having committed sins that qualified for such a penalty, if they sinned repeatedly, to lock them up and feed them a diet of barley until the sinner\u2019s intestines collapsed and he died.", "1": "\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4' \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cafter the Lord had struck the river Nile;\u201d the reason why G\u2019d smote the river Nile first was that the Egyptians considered it as providing the backbone to their economy, its waters irrigating their fields. G\u2019d reasoned that He would first smite the Egyptians\u2019 deity and, if this did not help, the Egyptians themselves. This principle is described as a parable in the Tanchuma section 13 on our portion: a layman decides to destroy the idol first, which will make it easier subsequently to destroy its priests.

When the expression \u05d4\u05e9\u05db\u05dd is used it means that Moses was to surprise Pharaoh when he went to the river early in the morning to maintain the fiction amongst his people that he did not need to excrete as do ordinary human beings. It would not be appropriate for the holy presence of G\u2019d to attend such a performance. I find this whole approach puzzling, as we know that Moses would not even offer the simplest prayer while on the ritually contaminated soil of Egypt, so why would G\u2019d accompany him on his audiences with Pharaoh?

We will have to fall back on the tradition that the acronyms of the ten plagues as per Rabbi Yehudah, had been etched into the side of his staff. The problem with this interpretation is that if so why did G\u2019d bother to give him advance notice of the two plagues following after the plague of locusts? It may be more plausible to assume that the words \u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05df \u05ea\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e0\u05da \u05d5\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05e0\u05da \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05dc\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cin order that you will be able to tell your son and your grandson what I have wrought upon Egypt,\u201d (verse 2) that this had included details about the forthcoming plague of locusts. We find that the plague of locusts recorded in the Book of Yoel (Yoel 1,3-4) was also introduced by the prophet telling his people to tell his children and grandchildren about it.

Apparently there are many different strains of locusts, and the statements by both the Torah and the Book of Yoel do not refer to the same strain. Even so, we are puzzled by a statement in Psalms 78,46, as well as 105,34-35 as the same strains of locusts are mentioned. Possibly, in the days of Moses all the different strains of locusts combined to invade that country at the same time. [A week before writing these lines, the land of Israel was invaded by a plague of locusts originating in Egypt and was repelled by spraying poison from airplanes. Our farmers had been very concerned. Ed.] The references in Yoel apparently must have referred to one specific strain that invaded the land of Israel at that time in such intensity. The Torah treated the strain known as \u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 and that of \u05d9\u05dc\u05e7 as distinct species.

When a nation disobeys its ruler, the first thing such a ruler does is to interfere with its water supply. This is why Good first interfered with Egypt\u2019s water supply, turning it into blood. When this proved ineffective, He resorted to frighten them by noises; in order to achieve this he had the frogs which are extremely noisy invade every part of the Egyptians\u2019 homes, including their most private rooms. When this also proved useless, He subjected them to pricks such as are caused when a person is struck by arrows. The vermin did this to the skin of the Egyptians. Following the failure of achieving his objective, He subjected civilised Egyptians to barbarians, i.e. to hordes of ferocious animals whose normal habitat was elsewhere. The next step was to strike their livestock, still not afflicting them with lethal force. They were then subjected to intolerable stench, eventually even immobilised during the plague of darkness. When this proved ineffective, He struck dead both adults and children, i.e. their respective firstborns.

If a conversation with G\u2019d concerning a minor matter required Moses to leave the capital, as we know from Exodus 9,29, when something of major importance was to be discussed this required him to leave the capital of Egypt even more so.[This is all based on the extraneous words \u201cin the land,\u201d in our verse. It would have otherwise sufficed to simply write: \u201cin Egypt.\u201d Ed.] The reason why outside the capital of Egypt G\u2019d would address Moses was that the land of Israel had not yet been chosen as the only area from which prophecy would be received. [When the first Temple was destroyed the prophet Ezekiel did receive prophetic visions as we know from Ezekiel 3,22. So did the prophet Jonah (Jonah 1,3) who had fled from the Holy Land. At any rate, as long as Jerusalem had not become the capital of Israel, G\u2019d sometimes addressed prophets outside its boundaries. During those years sacrificial offerings were also acceptable outside Jerusalem. Moses\u2019 warning in Deuteronomy 12,13, not to offer such offerings any place the owner of the animal chose to do so, was also not effective before the Temple stood in Jerusalem. The town itself was potentially on a spiritual level where prophetic visions could be received. As long as Aaron had not been appointed as High Priest, any area was potentially fit to serve as sovereign soil for the Jewish people under a king. These rules are derived from verses in Kings I 8,16, as well as from Chronicles II 13,5.", "1": "\u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4, \u201cthis month. [Seeing that the word \u201cmonth\u201d is an abstract term that cannot be described as visible, \u201dthe meaning of G\u2019d\u2019s words are; \u201cwhen you observe the position of the moon in which you see it at this time, this is when the lunar cycle enters a new phase, i.e. when the month in the Jewish calendar begins.\u201d This event is to be sanctified by you on each occasion. The members of the Jewish High Court will have to officially proclaim this event. The word \u05dc\u05db\u05dd, \u201dfor you,\u201d is G\u2019d\u2019s authority to appoint the High Court as competent to declare when the moon has renewed itself. If the members of the High Court deem it in the national interest, they have the authority to postpone the new moon for an extra day. [They do not have the authority to advance it for a day. Ed.] When Rosh Hashanbah approaches, G\u2019d informs the angels that He will sit in judgment of mankind, and He gave them a preview similar to what He did with Avraham when He was about to destroy Sodom and its satellites. According to Rabbi Aushiyah, after He had told the angels that He was afraid He would have to destroy mankind, it happened once that when the day came and He had not sat in judgment, the angels approached G\u2019d asking Him if He did not say to them: \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll sit in judgment over all of mankind and the judgment will result in our allowing mankind to disintegrate\u201d? G\u2019d replied: \u201cMy children have forced Me to delay this for a day when I authorised them to decide on making adjustments to the calendar.\u201d [The editor of my edition of this edition of the Daat Z\u2019keynim, points to a similar, but not identical statement in Sh\u2019mot Rabbah 15,2, the prediction of mankind being destroyed being missing. Ed.] [If I understand the point of the Midrash correctly, if G\u2019d had sat in judgment on the day on which Rosh Hashanah should have been according to His calendar, on that day the balance of good and evil on earth would have resulted in mankind having forfeited the right to exist. Due to the Rabbis having decided to observe Rosh Hashanah one day later, the pendulum by then will have swung to a positive balance allowing G\u2019d a chance to continue to give mankind another chance. Ed.] Being aware of this, Moses said in Deuteronomy 4,7:\u05db\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05db\u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cfor what great nation is there that has G\u2019d so close to them, as the Lord our G\u2019d whenever we call upon Him?\" The word \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 in that verse is to be understood as if it had been spelled \u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cour calling,\u201d i.e. proclaiming the times of the new moon, or an additional calendar month making leap years.\u201d According to our sages in the Talmud, tractate Menachot folio 29, this subject was one of three that Moses had had difficulty in comprehending without Divine assistance. [He had to be shown what the moon looked like at time of its monthly renewal. Ed.] Our author does not follow this, saying that anyone of us can see that at the end of the month it almost disappears completely, and at the beginning of the month it reappears gaining is visibility until full moon. Moses\u2019 difficulty was that on the last day of the month the moon is just as invisible as on the first day of the month. How are we then to know if today is the last day of last month or the first day of the month just commencing? The answer is that the difference is that when approaching the end of the month, the hollow area of the semicircle points in the opposite direction from what it does at the beginning of the month. The hollow area faces west when the moon is in its second half, while it faces east when in its first half. Another way of determining this is that near the end of its monthly orbit it is visible in the south-eastern corner of the sky, whereas at the beginning of its monthly orbit it faces south-west.", "2": "\u05d1\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9, \u201con the tenth day of the month;\u201d the acquisition of the Paschal lamb in Egypt had to be made on the tenth of the month. There was a special reason for this. When the firstborn Egyptians saw what the Israelites were doing, they asked them for the reason of this. The Israelites explained that it was an offering to be offered when G\u2019d would skip over the homes of the Israelites when He would slay the Egyptian firstborns as a punishment for their refusing to let the Israelites go. Upon hearing this, the firstborn Egyptians immediately went to the other Egyptians telling them to release the Israelites forthwith, accusing them of responsibility for their death in case they refused. Nonetheless, the other Egyptians refused. In fact, they themselves slew some of the firstborns in an altercation. This is what is meant when we read in Psalms 136,10: \u05dc\u05de\u05db\u05d4 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3\u05d5, i.e. the psalmist does not write: that G\u2019d smote the Egyptian firstborns, but that the Egyptians killed their firstborn. (Compare Midrash Tehillim 136, as well as Yalkut Shimoni on that verse.) We read also in that Midrash that the tenth of the month of Nissan of that year occurred on a Sabbath so that Passover occurred on the Thursday following, as stated in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 87. When the Egyptians saw how the Jews made ready to cut the throats of their lambs they attacked them, as they were afraid of these animals, which were deities for them, and feared punishment for allowing their deities to be slain. G\u2019d performed a miracle for the Israelites thus attacked and they were saved. This is the reason why the Sabbath prior to the Exodus is called \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc, \u201cthe great Sabbath.\u201d Still we need to explore the reason why the tenth day in Nissan was chosen for the command to the Israelites to purchase, or if they had animals to set aside the respective animal for that sacrifice. According to Rashi, the Israelites were required to perform circumcision on themselves prior to being able to slaughter and to partake of the Paschal lamb. It would take them four days to recover from the wounds inflicted through their having circumcised themselves. (Attributed to Rabbi Yitzchok from Ibro.)", "3": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05e9\u05e8, \u201cthey are to eat the meat;\u201d this is the reason why the people established the custom to take three unleavened loaves of bread on the evening when the meat of the Passover would be consumed. It was a reminder of the three measures of flour Avraham told Sarah to use when baking cakes for what turned out to be the three angels, one of whom predicted when she would give birth to Yitzchok. (Genesis 18,6) The date happened to be that of the first day of Passover, (in the future) as we know from the fact that on the same evening Lot welcomed two of these angels and served them unleavened bread. An alternate version of the significance of the three matzot on our seder dish is that they are to remind us of the three patriarchs. The reason why we break the middle one of these three matzot in half is that it symbolises G\u2019d having split the sea of reeds in half to enable the Jewish people to cross it and escape the pursuit of Pharaoh and his army. We pronounce the special blessing over one half of this middle matzah, as related in the Talmud tractate Pessachim folio 115, as a reminder that it is called the \u201cbread of the poor,\u201d meaning that a poor man does not have a whole loaf of bread at his disposal. The reason why we perform two \u201cdippings\u201d on that night is to serve as a reminder that when becoming officially Jewish after performing the circumcision, both the people themselves and their livestock immersed themselves in a ritual bath. An alternate interpretation is that we had to dip the blood of the Pashal lamb and sprinkle it on the lintel and upright posts, mezuzot, of our homes, to insure that the firstborn Jews would not be killed on that night, as were those of the Egyptians. We recite a further reminder of this by quoting from the Book of Ezekiel, that our redemption was linked to our being kept alive by offering that blood (Ezekiel 16,6). One of the reasons why this ritual is performed on that night is to encourage the children at the table to ask why we perform so many strange acts during that evening instead of proceeding from kiddush to Motzi, breaking bread, directly. Normally, vegetables used to be eaten as a kind of dessert, whereas on this evening we commence with them. We never drink two cups of wine before eating bread, whereas on this evening we make a point of drinking two cups of wine before eating any bread (matzah). As soon as the child sees us pouring the second cup of wine he begins asking questions. The concoction known as charosset that we dip the bitter herbs in, is a reminder of the mortar that was used in the bricks, i.e. its colour. It is composed of ground apples, commemorating an apple in Song of Songs 8,5, in which G\u2019d is described allegorically as having overturned an apple tree at Mount Sinai, at the time when the Jewish people accepted the Torah, having thus aroused the Jewish people to respond with their famous \u05e0\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05e2, \u201cwe will perform the laws of the Torah as soon as we will hear what they are.\u201d It also contains different spices, resembling in appearance the straw that the Egyptians had withheld from them after Moses had asked Pharaoh for a short vacation to celebrate a religious festival. Our author cites different interpretations of the various items on the seder plate nowadays when we cannot celebrate the real thing, one being the egg the other a roasted bone, the one symbolising the chagigah offering, offered by each pilgrim who came to Jerusalem on that festival, the other symbolising the Paschal lamb, unfortunately also not available while we are in exile. The four cups of wine drank on that night are in commemoration of the four stages of the redemption. The respective words on the Torah are:\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9, \u05d5\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9, \u05d5\u05d2\u05d0\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9, \u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea\u05db\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9, \u201cI will take you out, I will save you, I will redeem you, and I will acquire you as My people.\u201d (Exodus 6, 6-7.) The fifth expression there, i.e. \u05d5\u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea\u05db\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u201cI shall bring you to the land, etc.\u201d is actually the purpose of the whole redemption. As per the proverb \u201cwhen a master releases his slave into freedom, and he gives him a cup of wine to drink, unless he also brings him to a house where he can enjoy that wine as a free man, the whole exercise was in vain.\u201d While we have been deprived of our land being in exile, we do not drink the fifth cup indicating that we look forward, to doing so, the sooner the better. Another way of looking at the ritual of drinking the four cups: They symbolise four different redemptions. Each \u201ccup\u201d has been mentioned in our Scriptures as such, in Psalms 16,5: \u05d4' \u05de\u05e0\u05ea \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d5\u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9, \u201cthe Lord is my allotted share and portion;\u201d also in Psalms 23,5:\u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cmy cup is abundant.\u201d The third time we find this reference to our \u201ccup\u201d in Psalms 116,13: \u05db\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9\u05d0, \u201cI raise my cup of deliverance.\u201d In that verse the reference is not to a single deliverance, but to multiple deliverances. Both refer to the deliverance in the days of the messiah and the world to come respectively. (Compare Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Pessachim, chapter 10, halachah 1. Yet another interpretation about why we drink four cups of wine on the night of the seder. It is a reminder of the four cups that Pharaoh\u2019s chief of the butlers told Joseph about that he had seen in his dream (Genesis 40, 11-13). Still another interpretation sees in the four cups a reference to the four cups of poison that G\u2019d will force the gentile nations to drink in the future, which the prophet Jeremiah has spoken about in Jeremiah 25,15-18. These cups are also referred to in Psalms 75,9 as well as in Jeremiah 51,7 and in Psalms 11,6 as pointed out in the section of the Jerusalem Talmud we quoted earlier.\n", "4": "\u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d0, \u201cdo not eat any of it while it is still raw;\u201d according to Ibn Ezra, the reason for this prohibition is that seeing that we had slaughtered an animal that was an abomination for the Egyptians the Israelites would not dare to roast or cook it for a long time in order that the Egyptians would not become aware of what they were doing; the Torah insists that everything they were doing should be performed in such a way that the Egyptians would be completely aware of it, hence the line: \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5, \u201cits head with its legs with its entrails.\u201d It must not be boiled in a pot as then it would not be seen by the Egyptians, as the pots had lids.", "5": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d7\u05e4\u05d6\u05d5\u05df, \u201cyou are to eat it in a rush;\u201d the sages decreed that it must be eaten so that it is the completion of the meal, the item that satiates the person eating it. The Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Pessachim chapter 15, halachah 4 explains that this is why the Torah ordered us not to break any of its bones (verse 46) seeing that when a person is overly hungry he is afraid of breaking a bone in his haste and as a result would harm himself. The Babylonian Talmud, tractate Pessachim, folio 84 states that this is a prohibition that applies only to the consumption of the Paschal lamb. Throughout the year, when we eat meat there is no prohibition to break bones and eat the marrow.", "6": "\u05d0\u05da \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, but on the first day, etc.: [the Torah now speaks of observances of the Passover in the future, as stated in verse 14 Ed.] The Torah warns that all leavened products must have been removed already on the \u201cfirst\u201d day, i.e. on the 14th of the month when the Paschal lamb has been slaughtered.

Rabbi Moshe had difficulty with Rashi\u2019s commentary here seeing that the Talmud in tractate Shabbat folio 150 states that the prohibition to ask gentiles to perform work for us on the Sabbath is of rabbinic origin, so how could it have been described from a verse in the Torah? We must therefore assume that what Rashi meant is that he understood the word \u05db\u05dc as only what is known as an assmachta, a \u201csupport\u201d from a word in the text, not a direct command.

At the time when this occurred, each such likeness of a firstborn even if he had died earlier, fell down and broke into pieces, and the inhabitants of the house mourned him as if he had died now.

On top of that they had been unable to equip themselves with provisions because they had been expelled, i.e. had been under great pressure and could not tarry any longer.

Rabbi David, grandfather of Rabbi Moshe, said that legally the land of the Philistines was a part of Palestine, as we do not find that Yitzchok ever left the land of Israel although he sojourned in the section populated by the Philistines for many years. (Genesis 26,6) Rabbi Moshe claims that a narrow tongue of land emanating in the land of the Philistines extended deep into the land of Israel. He concluded this, seeing that the Torah called the land: \u201cthe land of the Philistines.\u201d An alternate approach: as soon as the Canaanites heard that the Israelites had left Egypt they reminded themselves of G\u2019d\u2019s promise to Avraham that the fourth generation of his descendants would return to the land of Canaan. (Genesis 15,16). In the event, the fourth generation had not yet been born and raised. In fact, G\u2019d was forced to make the Israelites wander in the desert for 40 years so that they would not invade the land of Canaan prematurely, and without support from Hashem. Instead, they would spend their time studying the Torah, and receive their sustenance by way of miracle, bread from heaven, and water by means of a well which traveled alongside them all the time till the death of Miriam. Nonetheless, the Canaanites were now afraid that the Israelites would try to dispossess them of their country; in order to deny the Israelites the advantages of possessing their land they started a policy of systematically ruining the soil of their land. When G\u2019d saw this, He was faced with a dilemma, seeing that He had promised to bring Avraham\u2019s descendants to a land of bountiful fruit, ample rainfall, etc., if He waited with making good on His promise He could not keep that part of it. This dilemma is what the prophet Hoseah referred to when he wrote in Hoseah 7,15: \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05e8\u05e2; \u201cbut I braced, I strengthened their arms, and they plot evil against Me!\u201d\n"}}, "13": {"0": {"0": "\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df, \u201cbefore Baal Tzefon.\u201d According to Rashi, this was the only idol that had remained intact of all the Egyptian deities. G\u2019d had arranged this in order to mislead the Egyptians into believing that this deity was more powerful that He. Pharaoh thought that the deity had deliberately tricked the Israelites in order to enable him to destroy them by means of water. [as a previous Pharaoh had attempted when he drowned the male Jewish infants. Ed.] This is why the Torah wrote in verse 10 that \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1, instead of \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1, \u201cPharaoh had presented an offering,\u201d instead of \u201cPharaoh approached,\u201d as this phrase is usually translated (Compare Mechilta B\u2019shalach 2,2).

Why would G\u2019d have asked the Jewish people to face this statue while encamping nearby? I suppose the prohibition applies only to human beings, not to G\u2019d Himself. After all, we are told that G\u2019d judges the gentile nations every Sabbath and every Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (Compare Rashi on the Talmud in tractate Rosha Hashanah folio 30.)

We would have to say that the day on which they prepared for the Exodus and offered the Paschal lamb is included in the days that Rashi referred to, seeing that they had been given notice of their impending departure.

The reason is that at first the same waters had been a terrible threat \u05d7\u05d9\u05de\u05d4, for them until the angel Gavriel came and made the waters pile up as if frozen solid, forming a wall of ice. The angel informed the waters on their right that the Israelites would shortly accept the Torah. Seeing that the Torah had always been on the right side of the Almighty, as we know from Deuteronomy 33,2: \u05d0\u05e9 \u05d3\u05ea \u05dc\u05de\u05d5, \u201cthe fire of the law at His right hand,\u201d this served as a warning to the waters. The angel then turned to the waters on the left side of the Israelites, warning the waters that the Israelites were going to wear phylacteries on their left arms. He also warned the waters behind the Israelites that these would be draped in garments equipped with fringes. When the waters heard all this they turned into solid walls. They divided themselves into 12 lanes. There were walls of frozen water between the 12 tribes so that one tribe could see members of any other tribe through windows in those walls. This enabled members of one tribe to keep in touch with members of the adjoining tribe. This is based on the line: \u201cthe waters became a wall for them.\u201d (Yalkut Shimoni section one 247 and 234) According to this Midrash, it would appear that when putting on one\u2019s Tallit, prayer shawl one should throw the tzitzit, fringes, backwards over one\u2019s shoulder. Our author feels that there is no need to do this. He feels that when enveloping oneself in the tallit, the fringes will be thrown backwards as part of that process.

This is why the Torah chose the expression \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d9\u05dd, \u201cin the heart of the sea,\u201d as the heart of a human being is located at the junction of the upper third of torso and the two lower thirds."}, "3": "\u05de\u05d9 \u05db\u05de\u05db\u05d4, \u201cwho is comparable to You?\u201d The reason this question has been repeated is that it refers to two different verses. The first one is verse 8, where the wind, \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05da, the wind issuing forth from G\u2019d\u2019s nostrils, is described as making the waves assume an upright posture; the second wind in verse 10 describes a natural wind at work but blowing constantly in the same direction. Wind emanating from the nose is basically hot, as opposed to wind emanating from arctic regions. Here the phenomena were reversed, the wind emanating from G\u2019d\u2019s nostrils resulting in the waters congealing, as a result of which the waters piled up upon layer after layer; the wind emanating from natural causes covered the Egyptian soldiers and their chariots so that they drowned. In accurate versions of the Torah scrolls the word \u05d1\u05d0\u05dc\u05dd, is spelled without the letter \u05d9, so that it does not refer to  deities, but refers to \u05d0\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, the dumb, describing how very often G\u2019d, even though He had good reason to raise His voice in protest, remained silent. (Talmud tractate Gittin, folio 56)", "4": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthey walked for a period of three days;\u201d when the Israelites had left Egypt they had taken vessels containing drinking water with them. As soon as they ran out of water they raised their voices complaining (verse 24) Instead of displaying a minimum amount of patience, they complained immediately. An alternate interpretation: the expression \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05dd, is an allegory; the people had been hoping to find Torah=\u05de\u05d9\u05dd=life sustaining water, but were sorely disappointed not to have found it, so they complained. In Isaiah 55,1, Torah has been equated with water. This is the reason why Ezra introduced the custom to read publicly from the Torah every Monday and Thursday, so that the people would not have to go without listening to a Torah reading for three successive days. (Talmud, tractate Baba Kamma, folio 82)", "5": " \u05d7\u05e7 \u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8, \u201ca law which is a social law,\u201d i.e. the commandment to honor one\u2019s parents.", "6": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9, \u05d4' \u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d0\u05da, \u201cfor I, the Lord, am your physician.\u201d The Torah here speaks of preventive medicine. It tells us that G\u2019d, i.e. His Torah, teaches us how to forestall sickness. Physicians are in the habit of telling their patients what to eat and what not to eat so that that they will not become victims of certain common diseases. This is why the verse commences with the warning to pay heed to what your Physician tells you before you become a victim to these diseases. We are to consider the performance of the Torah\u2019s commandments as preventive medicine. Our author also quotes Isaiah 17,11 as support for his interpretation. The prophet wrote: \u05e0\u05d3 \u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e0\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05db\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9, \u201con the day that you plant you see it grow.\u201d He also quotes proverbs 4,22, where the author concludes his advice in verse 20 by stating: \u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5 \u05de\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0, \u201cand healing for all his flesh.\u201d (Attributed to Rabbi Joseph Karo). The words:  \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 in our verse above is interpreted as having the same meaning as the same word in Samuel II 12,2: \u05d5\u05dc\u05e8\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05db\u05dc, \u201cand the poor man does not have anything,\u201d and as in Psalms 78,38: \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d5, \u201cand He did not give full vent to His fury,\u201d i.e. \u201cany of the different kinds of disease I will not inflict upon you.\u201d"}, "15": {"0": "\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05e8, \u201ctwo measures known as omer,\u201d (per person). During all the weekdays in the year they made two loaves of bread from one measure of flour called omer. It follows that they were able to make four loaves from the amount of manna which fell on the Sabbath eve. The first of these were meant to be eaten on the Sabbath eve. The next two loaves were used on the meal after Kiddush on Friday night, when one of these loaves would be eaten. It was the people\u2019s custom to eat one loaf of bread each during each meal. This left them with two loaves for the Sabbath day. This enabled them to again have two loaves at the Sabbath day meal. This serves as proof that there is no halachic requirement to have two loaves of bread for the Sabbath afternoon meal. (Compare Tur shulchan aruch, orach chayim, paragraph 298) However, I have seen a very learned Rabbi in Merinon who insisted on having two whole loaves of bread for his afternoon meal on the Sabbath, and I have been told of Rabbi Avraham that the origin of that custom is verse 29 are the words: \u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05db\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea, \u201cfor the Lord has given you the Sabbath,\u201d which were interpreted by Rabbi Yitzchok as follows: \u201cif the gentiles ask you why you are so meticulous in observing the laws of the Sabbath, tell them of the great miracle we experienced while in the desert when on account of the Sabbath G\u2019d gave us an extra portion of manna.\u201d (Compare Yalkut Shimoni, section 1 paragraph 261) According to what is stated there, not only is there no need to have two loaves for the Sabbath afternoon meal, but it is even doubtful if kiddush need to be recited over wine unless one interprets the superfluous words \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea (Exodus 20,8) as suggested by the Talmud tractate Beytzah and Pessachim, folio 106.", "1": "\u05e7\u05d7 \u05e6\u05e0\u05e6\u05e0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea, \u201ctake a jar;\u201d our author claims that the expression \u05e6\u05e0\u05e6\u05e0\u05ea suggests that it is made from a material from which something can sprout forth and be seen, in other words from earthenware as it is made from the earth.\n"}, "16": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e2\u05de\u05dc\u05e7, Amalek came;\u201d it is difficult to understand why Amalek, if he was keen on attacking the Israelites, had waited until after they had been so miraculously saved from the Egyptians. He would have had a much easier target when the seventy people making up Yaakov\u2019s family were on their way to Egypt. The answer may be that when G\u2019d said to Avraham (Genesis 15,13) \u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd, \u201cthey will serve them and they (their masters) will abuse them,\u201d that as soon as Avraham would die this prophecy would be come applicable to Yitzchok and upon Yitzchok\u2019s death it would devolve on Yaakov and his children. Amalek may have reasoned that if he were to wipe out Yaakov and family, this curse would devolve upon him. He therefore waited until the 400 years were up according to his calculation, before attacking the descendants of Avraham.", "1": {"0": "\u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cand Moses, Aaron as well as Chur, etc.\u201d according to Rashi, Chur was a son of Miriam, although in Exodus 24,14 he describes Chur as being a son of Miriam and Calev. This is based on Chronicles II 19 where Calev is described as having married Efrat, another name for Miriam, as stated in the Talmud tractate Sotah, folio 11. Why then was she called \u05e2\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4, when according to the Talmud quoted, Calev is described as having married Efrat after Azuvah, his first wife had died? How could Chur have been the son of Miriam seeing that he was the son of Efrat? I believe that Rashi\u2019s commentary is correct and that there is no contradiction here at all. The verse in Chronicles I 2,18 described Calev the son of Chetzron siring Azuvah, \u201cIshah\u201d [as if she were his wife, Ed.] and Yeriot, who in turn gave birth to Yashar, Shovav and Ardon before Azuvah had died. Thereupon Calev married Efrat who gave birth to Chur for him. Chur in turn became the father of Uri, etc. In the Talmud Sotah, Rashi states that Calev was the son of Chetzron, something that needs explaining, seeing that the Torah describes him as being the son of Yefuneh. (Numbers 13,6) Rashi considers the name \u201cYefuneh\u201d as an acrostic praising the bearer of that name as not having made common cause with the spies. Still, he is also described as the son of K\u2019naz in Joshua 15,17) According to Rava in the Talmud Sotah, folio 11, he was an adopted son of K\u2019naz. This makes sense when we compare it with what is written in Numbers 32,12 where the name Yefuneh is linked to a member of the house of K\u2019naz. Azuvah is identified as the same person that also appears with the name of Miriam. The reason that she was also known as Azuvah, \u201cthe abandoned one,\u201d is because of the traumas she had experienced in her personal life. She had been afflicted with the dread disease tzoraat, as a result everyone abandoned her while she was thus afflicted. Her son had been murdered by the mob demanding to worship the golden calf. Another question concerning her is that the Torah described her as \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3 \u201che sired!?\u201d She was his wife! How could she have sired anyone? Our sages say that if one marries a woman for religious reasons, in order to have G\u2019d fearing children from her, one is considered as if one had physically sired such children.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cand Yeriot.\u201d According to Rashi, Miriam also gave birth to Yeriot, though many years later, when she was already eighty years old.

Joshua used the same method (verse 9) where he is described as selecting a relatively small number of men of military age to confront Amalek. He did not kill the Amalekites on this occasion but only disabled them from fighting by cutting of their hands or feet. Hence the verb \u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05dc\u05d5\u05e9 is most appropriate.\n", "3": {"0": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05de\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d0\u05de\u05d7\u05d4, \u201cfor I will completely wipe out, etc.\u201d the repetition of the verb is to tell us that both in this world and in the world to come there will eventually remain no descendants of Amalek.", "1": "\u05d0\u05ea \u05d6\u05db\u05e8 \u05e2\u05de\u05dc\u05e7, the word \u05d6\u05db\u05e8 is a reference to Haman, the word  Amalek is to be understood at face value.\n"}, "4": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05e1 \u05d9-\u05d4, he (Moses) said: \u201cas soon as G\u2019d\u2019s hand on His throne will become firmly established throughout His universe, He will go to war against Amalek. The word \u05d9\u05d3 describing an active monarchy is found in Samuel I 15,12,. I have heard in the name of Rabbi Aaron Halevi of blessed memory who questioned that the subject of the word \u05d9\u05d3 here is Amalek, seeing that it says: \u201dI will surely wipe out.\u201d How could Amalek have said this of himself? On the other hand in Deuteronomy 25,19, Moses commands the people in the name of the Lord that once the time has come when there is no more antisemitism, instead of letting bygones be bygones, the Jewish people are charged with seeing to it that even the mention of the name Amalek will be eradicated once and for all. Personally, I do not see a problem there at all. In our portion we discuss times when Amalek raises its hand against Israel. At such a time we need G\u2019d to defend us against him. In Deuteronomy, it is presumed Amalek is raising his sword against the Temple, G\u2019d\u2019s home on earth. When the residence of the Lord is in danger, it is G\u2019d\u2019s people, we, who have to rise up in its defense. Jerusalem is called the throne of G\u2019d. His throne is not secure as long as there is still any descendant of Amalek alive on this earth. We read in Psalms 9,8: \u05d5\u05d4' \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05df \u05dc\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 \u05db\u05e1\u05d0\u05d5, \u201cbut the Lord abides forever; He has set up His throne for judgment.\u201d This is the reason why the dead are unable to praise the Lord (Psalms 115,17) seeing that being dead they cannot battle Amalek. This is why David continues in Psalm 118 with: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5', \u201cI do not wish to die, as I want to be able to tell of the great deeds of the Lord, etc.\u201d\n"}, "17": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e2 \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5, \u201cYitro heard;\u201d this man had seven different names. They were: Yitro, Yeter, Chever, Chovev, Keyni, Puti-el, and R\u2019uel. According to some scholars, it was Yitro\u2019s father who was called R\u2019-uel. They base themselves on Exodus 2,18: \u05d5\u05ea\u05d1\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc \u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd, \u201cthey came to their father, R\u2019uel.\u201d Children are in the habit of referring to their grandfather as their \u201cfather.\u201d Still, this raises the following difficulty for those scholars: if they were correct, how do we understand the line in Numbers 10,29: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1 \u05d1\u05df \u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05df \u05de\u05e9\u05d4, \u201cMoses said to Chovav, son of R\u2019uel, the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses;\u201d We may have to answer this by saying that the scholar who says that that the scholar who identifies Yitro with R\u2019uel, may not consider that the name \u201cChovav\u201d was merely a compliment to this man who looked with great fondness at the Torah, \u05d7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d1 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, as explained by Rashi, but that he must also hold that R\u2019uel was the father of Yitro. The reason why Yitro was also named \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8, Yeter, \u201caddition,\u201d is that on account of this man a whole portion has been added to the Torah in his honour. At any rate, as pointed out by Rashi, we do not have seven names for him. The \u201cnames\u201d given in the Mechilta quoted by Rashi are only the adjectives which were added to his original name on account of historical events or events in his personal life, such as his conversion to Judaism. Judges 4,11 as well as the expression: \u05d5\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3 \u05de\u05e7\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1 \u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05df \u05de\u05e9\u05d4, \u201cChever the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites, descendants of Chovav father-in-law of Moses,\u201d presents another difficulty.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5, \u201che prostrated himself;\u201d our author is in two minds about who is the subject in this verse, i.e. who prostrated himself to whom.? It is reasonable to assume that word \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 in the verse refers to Moses. After all, Moses had been referred to in Deuteronomy 32,1 as \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthe man of G\u2019d.\u201d On the other hand, the Torah describes Yitro also as \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9, already in Exodus 2,21 when it tells us that Moses agreed to take up residence in his father-in-law\u2019s house. Some scholars hold that we must draw comparisons only when the word in question is exactly the same, not when there is a prefix or suffix appended. The word: \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 in Exodus 2,21, therefore does not refer to the same man as the one in Deuteronomy we have quoted. In addition we find that the attribute \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 is used for Moses, as directly next to his name either after or in front, (as in Numbers 12,3,) whereas this is not so with Yitro. It is clear that this interpretation is based on the school that holds that R\u2019uel was the father of Yitro. According to that school of thought, Exodus 2,21 stating: \u201che gave his daughter Tzipporah to Moses as a wife,\u201d is another example of grandfathers being considered as fathers.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5, according to Rashi, the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05d3 means that Yitro\u2019s flesh broke out in goose-pimples when reflecting on what had happened to Pharaoh and his army. Rashi\u2019s grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, pointed out that Rashi had scriptural proof to support this interpretation. We find the following verse in Chronicles I, 2,35: \u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05df \u05e9\u05e9\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e8\u05d7\u05e2 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4, \u201cSheshan gave his daughter to his (Egyptian slave) as a wife.\u201d [This Egyptian slave had of course converted before being given a Jewish wife.

Deduct 3 generations when Egyptians are not allowed to convert to Judaism and you will find confirmation for the opinion quoted by Rashi, that a convert\u2019s genes do not completely disappear for 10 generations until there is not a trace of his original character that surfaces on occasion. Rashi, quoting a Mechilta, had warned that in the presence of a convert we must not speak in derogatory terms about a gentile unless being certain that the Jew to whom we speak who had had pagan ancestry, was already at least the descendant of nine previous Jewish generations. Yitro, a first generation convert, clearly would feel discomfort when reflecting on the fate that had befallen Pharaoh.", "3": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05de\u05de\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea, \u201cIt happened on the following day, etc.\u201d according to Rashi, this was the day following Yom Kippur, on which day Moses had returned from Mount Sinai for the third time and after G\u2019d had forgiven the sin of the golden calf, and he had brought down with him a second set of Tablets inscribed by G\u2019d Himself. Rashi is forced to explain it in this way as there had not been time between the revelation at Mount Sinai on the sixth day of Sivan, for Moses to have sat down to deal with the people\u2019s personal problems, as on the day after the revelation he had been invited to the top of the mountain where he spent 40 days studying the Torah, and when he descended with the first set of tablets which he smashed when seeing the people dance around the golden calf, and his spontaneous return to the mountain to ask G\u2019d to forgive the people seeing that they had cleansed themselves from their sin as best as they could, and the active idol worshippers had been executed. He had been invited to ascend the mountain again and bring with him a set of Tablets which he had carved out of the rock himself, and on which G\u2019d had inscribed the text of the Ten Commandments a second time. These events have not been recorded in the Torah in their chronological order just as the events culminating in the Israelites departing from Mount Sinai have not been recorded in their chronological order; We read in Numbers 10,29 about Moses entreating Yitro to remain with the Jewish people, something that could not have occurred until the second month of the second year, as he speaks about the impending journey of the people and these are recorded as having broken camp on the twentieth day of that month. When Yitro is described as advising Moses to appoint delegates to function as judges of civil cases, this is reported in Exodus chapter eighteen, before the revelation had been reported. Moses could certainly not have sat down judging the people before the Torah had been revealed to him. Rashi therefore accepted the version of the Talmud tractate Zevachim folio 116, according to which Yitro had not arrived in the camp until after the revelation, i.e. after Yom Kippur, as how could Moses have had time to welcome him, eat with him, etc., between the revelation and the Day of Atonement, i.e. the tenth of Tishrey? Furthermore, as argued in the Tanchuma, G\u2019d did not see why seeing the people had undergone hundreds of years of hardship in order to qualify for the revelation at Mount Sinai. Yitro who during all these years had lived tranquilly in Midian, should be granted the same privilege without having done much to earn it? [According to our tradition the privilege of being present at the revelation is one of three privileges that must be earned by having gone through \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, great hardships.", "4": "\u05d2\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4, the word \u05d2\u05dd is meant to include Aaron and Chur.

If that had been so, there were no 600000 privates left in that army. We would have to assume therefore that Moses started with appointing 60000 potential chiefs. Having done so, he proceeded step by step to appoint the most capable of them to become either chiefs over 50, or over 1o00, or over 1000 each. As to the statement in the Talmud there that there were a total of 78600 chiefs of different ranks, this number applied to the people appointed as judges. Alternately, whereas the active soldiers were all of the ages between 20 and years of age, the officers over 50, 100, and 1000, respectively, could have been over 60 years of age.\n"}, "18": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4, \u201cMoses brought back the reply, etc.\u201d the reason why in verse eight the Torah uses the term \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1, for Moses bringing back the people\u2019s answer, whereas in verse nine the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05d3, \u201che told,\u201d was chosen by the Torah  is that when Moses began to tell G\u2019d the people\u2019s reaction, G\u2019d interrupted him by saying that He wanted him to wait as He wished to speak to him some more. When G\u2019d had completed speaking with Moses, Moses resumed telling Him about the people\u2019s reaction. In the tractate Shabbat, on folio 87, Rabbi Akiva is quoted saying that the word above refers to the limitations imposed on the people, their being warned not to approach the mountain too closely as well as Rabbi Yoseph son of Rabbi Yehudah, according to whom G\u2019d told the people first about the reward in store for people observing the Torah. Different scholars argue about whether Moses told the people first about the punishment for not observing the Torah, or whether he told them first about the reward in store for the people if they observed the laws of the Torah. The Ten Commandments were given on the Sabbath, as Rabbi Akiva said, the verse supporting being Isaiah 30,15: \u05d1\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05d7\u05ea \u05ea\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u05d5\u05df, \u201cyour salvation will come about by quiet and stillness.\u201d The first time we hear about the concept as of stillness and quiet is when G\u2019d rested on the seventh day of Creation. The second set of Tablets was also given to the people on a Sabbath, i.e. the Day of Atonement, also known as \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05df, the \u201cultimate\u201d Sabbath.", "1": {"0": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d2\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d3, \u201cdo not touch it with your hand;\u201d  Why did this have to be repeated when we had heard already in the preceding verse that anyone touching the mountain would be subject to the death penalty? The two verses have to be understood as follows: \u201cwhen you are about to execute a person guilty of having touched the mountain, do not do so by using your hands against him but stone him to death.\u201d The stones are to be thrown from some distance away from the culprit. If you were to approach the area where the sin was committed you would be in danger of committing the same offence, even though unintentionally.

(Compare Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 88). How can we reconcile this with the statement on the same folio that the people by saying: \u05e0\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05e2, (Exodus 24,7) \u201cwe are ready to accept the laws of the Torah before we have even heard any details\u201d had paid G\u2019d the greatest possible compliment? We need to say that when G\u2019d wanted to give the Torah to Israel, they asked Him how many different Torahs He had at His disposal? He told them that He had both a written and an oral Torah at His disposal. They answered that they were willing to accept the written Torah, but could not promise to accept the oral Torah. As soon as G\u2019d heard this, the mountain began to assume a threatening posture, and they became frightened. (Tanchuma on the portion section 58, paragraph 3) This is what caused the Talmud on folio 88 in Shabbat, to coin the expression that at Mount Sinai the Jewish people accepted the Torah under great moral/psychologial pressure, whereas during the period of Achashverosh, in exile, they accepted it wholeheartedly without any external pressure. (Yalkut Shimoni, Isaiah, second section item 389). G\u2019d is supposed to have wrapped a sword inside the Torah, implying that unless they accepted the Torah they would die by the sword. This is also supposed to be the reason why the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 1,19, wrote: \u05d0\u05dd \u05ea\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05ea\u05dd \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05ea\u05de\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\u05dd, \u05d7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05db\u05d9 \u05e4\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8, \u201cif you agree and give heed, you will eat the good things of the earth; but if you refuse and disobey, you will be devoured by the sword.\u201d What occasion did the prophet have in mind when he wrote these words? None other than when the people stood at attention at Mount Sinai.

Neither for that matter, was Moses\u2019 answer. Do we not have numerous laws in the Torah which have been repeated several times? Furthermore, why did G\u2019d tell Moses to descend and to subsequently ascend again? We need to understand the plain meaning of these verses as follows: Moses had warned the people not to ascend the mountain and violate the fenced off area, but he had not spelled out that to do so would result in the person doing so being executed. (Compare verse 15) G\u2019d had spelled out the penalty for violation to him in verse 12, but he is not on record as having included this in his asking the people to prepare for the revelation. This is why G\u2019d had to tell him to first descend and remedy this omission. [Moses, being who he was, had thought that his fencing off the area was sufficient. The idea that anyone would dare disobey had not occurred to him. Ed.] He was told that this warning not to breach the fence was a greater violation than the disobedience of many other commandments, which do not carry the death penalty. Moses\u2019 reply that the people could not try and ascend the mountain was based on the assumption that seeing that both he and Aaron would be there, they would surely be able to prevent this. They too had been included in the warning not to try and ascend or even touch the mountain. G\u2019d responded that not as he thought that he too could not ascend the mountain, he would be asked to do so, and even Aaron would be able to approach closer than the people. This is why he had to warn the people once more not to violate the prohibition on pain of death. Thereupon Moses immediately descended and carried out G\u2019d\u2019s command."}, "19": {"0": "\u05d0\u05ea \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8, \u201call of these words.\u201d The word \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 teaches that the entire Ten Commandments would be part of a single utterance, something that it is impossible for the mouth of a human being to do. Seeing that this was so, why does the Torah write it as if it had been a number of separate utterances, i.e. \u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da, \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05da, etc.? This shows that Moses repeated each of the commandments. (Mechilta, Yitro bachodesh, section 4) This appears hard to understand, how did the author of the Mechilta think that Moses contributed to our understanding the Ten Commandments by repeating, or trying to repeat what G\u2019d had done? What was meant is that Moses by adding the cantillations, enabled the people to understand every word. A different interpretation of this Mechilta by Rabbi Baruch: Moses in his repeating the utterance separated between what is the first verse in our chumashim, and the second verse by taking a breath, although basically the two verses are part of the same commandment. Proof of that is the fact G\u2019d is speaking in the first person repeatedly, i.e. \u201cI have taken you out of Egypt; My presence; I am the Lord your G\u2019d; \u201cthe ones who hate Me.\u201d \u201cThe ones who love Me.\u201d All the other parts of the Ten Commandments are addressed to \u201cyou.\u201d This is why the Talmud in tractate Makkot folio 24 states that the first two Commandments were uttered by G\u2019d personally. The Talmud explains that although G\u2019d uttered all Ten Commandments, the people could only hear and understand G\u2019d as speaking the first two commandments. [They had asked Moses to interpret the remainder for them. Ed]\n", "1": "\u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da, \u201cI am the Lord your G\u2019d;\u201d how can we understand this utterance as a \u201ccommandment?\u201d In which way does it represent an order to the listener? We must understand the words: \u201cI am the Lord your G\u2019d,\u201d as implying that this is something that you must accept as fact, not merely as an article of faith, i.e. \u201cyou know, you do not merely believe.\u201d It follows from accepting this as a fact that there is a system of reward and punishment for your actions, as He is capable of meting out reward and punishment as a result of being the Creator. Rabbi Tanchuma adds that this obligation of yours is the direct result of your having been allowed to see Him revealing Himself as a mighty warrior at the sea of reeds, when He saved you miraculously and meted out punishment to your pursuers. At the same time, He appeared to you in the guise of a merciful G\u2019d at Mount Sinai. Do not make the mistake of thinking that the Power that addressed you at Mount Sinai, is a different Power than the One which dealt with the Egyptians. You have merely witnessed G\u2019d manifesting Himself as possessing multiple attributes. The word \u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9 is best translated as \u201cI and no one else.\u201d (Mechilta, bachodesh, section 5) A different approach: seeing that at the revelation G\u2019d had been accompanied by tens of thousands of spiritual beings, angels, it was necessary for Him to point out that only He is the Lord, all other beings are merely servants of His. He also used the opportunity to show them that heaven consists of seven layers of what are commonly known as \u201cheaven,\u201d but that only the highest layer is the domain in which His throne is to be found. This event has been recalled by Moses in Deuteronomy 4,35, i.e.\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea \u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05dc\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5-\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cyou have been given a visual demonstration that only the Lord is the G\u2019d, there is none other.\" This is also why the first two commandments are addressed in the singular mode, i.e. to each Israelite separately, a fact that Moses took advantage of when pleading on behalf of the people after they committed the sin of the golden calf, when he said to G\u2019d: \u201cI am the only human being to whom You have addressed the first two commandments. The people only heard it from me. Therefore they have not violated a commandment that they have heard from You.\u201d The Midrash adds that this is also the reason why all the other eight commandments were addressed to the Israelites as individuals, not collectively as in Leviticus 25,2-7, for instance, or as in Leviticus 26,3-13. G\u2019d foresaw that individual Israelites in the future, such as the false prophet Micah (Judges chapter 17) who tried to eliminate the first commandment, or King Jerobam (Kings I chapter 12) who tried to abolish the second commandment. The list can be lengthened showing that individuals acted in a way that showed they felt they could ignore one or another basic commandment of the Ten Commandments.\u201d By wording these Commandments in the singular mode addressed to each Israelite individually, none could claim that it did not apply to them. When you count the letters in the Ten Commandments, commencing with the letter \u05d0 in \u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9 and concluding with the letter in \u05da in \u05dc\u05e8\u05e2\u05da there are a total of 613 letters, signaling to us that all the 613 commandments of the Torah are in one way or another contained in these Ten Commandments which are a summary. In the first chapter of tractate Kidushin, in the Talmud we are told that when the gentile nations heard the first two of the Ten Commandments, they concluded that G\u2019d was concerned only with establishing His own reputation. When they subsequently heard of the commandment to honour father and mother, they changed their mind and accepted also the first two commandments as valid. This is what David referred to in Psalms 138,4: \u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05da \u05d4' \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05db\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e4\u05d9\u05da, \u201call the kings of the earth shall praise You, O Lord, for they have heard the words coming forth from Your mouth.\u201d\n"}, "20": {"0": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cand these are the ordinances, etc.;\u201d Rashi has pointed out that whenever a paragraph in the Torah commences with the word \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4, this signifies that it is not a continuation of something that had been written previously. However, when the paragraph begins with the word: \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4, \u201cand these, etc., it signals some kind of continuation. From Rashi\u2019s words it would appear that the laws promulgated from here on in did not originate at Sinai as when the Torah wrote in Exodus 19,20 that Hashem descended to Mount Sinai, the whole point was that He did so in order to give the people the whole Torah.In order to solve this apparent contradiction, we need to view the word: \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc used by Rashi to signify a break with what preceded it, is to be understood as in Exodus 34,1 where G\u2019d told Moses to hew himself two Tablets to replace the ones he had shattered after coming down from the Mountain for the first time. The act of \u201chewing\u201d means to separate what you carve out from a greater quantity of the same base material, i.e. rock. In other words, what we are going to read from here on in are laws that, though of the same origin as the Ten Commandments, had been separated somewhat in time from when and how they were presented to the people. What Rashi meant to tell us was that if this paragraph had commenced with the word \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4, I would have thought that what followed was not of Sinaitic origin at all. In order not to mislead the reader, the Torah added the prefix \u05d5 to make clear that what follows was also of Sinaitic origin, i.e. G\u2019d taught Moses all the Torah while he was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights. The letter \u05d5 here has the same meaning as the word \u05d0\u05ea in Exodus 9,29, where Moses said: \u05db\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8, \u201cwhen I go out from the city.\u201d We find a similar construction in Deuteronomy 28,69: \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea, \u201cthese are the words of the covenant, \u201dwhere the admonitions have been separated from the blessings. The blessings in that paragraph had been preceded by curses. We find something similar in Deuteronomy 1,1: \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4, \u201cthese are the words which Moses had spoken, etc.\u201d where we cannot understand this as something unconnected to what preceded it, but the letter \u05d5 is omitted as we are dealing with a different Book of the Torah, one that had not been dictated to Moses, but which G\u2019d had approved after the event as deserving to be part of the written Torah. In Genesis 2,4 the words \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cthese are the generations of heaven and earth are separated from the prehistoric period when the Torah had described the tohu vavohu which had preceded the creation of light.", "1": "\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd, \u201cbefore them.\u201d Rashi sees in this word an exclusion of gentiles, to whom all these ordinances will not apply, even if they would adopt our system of civil law. [Presumably, he felt that otherwise that word is superfluous, as it is obvious that the laws would be addressed to the |sraelites. Ed.] Jews are not allowed to submit their litigation to a gentile court even if the rules of that court are like those of ours. Our author uses a parable to illustrate the point. Imagine that two sick persons go to a physician to have themselves examined. The physician tells one of them to eat, heartily and healthily, whereas he tells the second one to abstain from some of the very foods he had encouraged the first person to eat from heartily. The reason is that not every food is good for everyone. What is good for one patient may be very dangerous for the next patient. When the physician advised the first patient to eat heartily, the reason was that that patient was diagnosed as fatally ill, so that he might as well enjoy the time left for him on earth. The same advice to the second patient would prove very dangerous for him. The same reasoning applies to Jews and gentiles. We read in Ezekiel 20,25 concerning the gentiles that G\u2019d had given them laws and statutes that they could not live by, whereas the laws He gave to the Israelites were designed to be for their benefit. [This verse is extremely difficult, and the reader is advised to read the commentary by Rabbi M.Eisemann in the Art Scroll edition of the Book of Ezekiel. Ed.] Rashi assumes that when the Israelites fail to observe G\u2019d\u2019s laws, they will eventually attribute their hardships to G\u2019d\u2019s laws having been harmful. We are taught in the Torah that the opposite is true. Compare Leviticus 18.5. This is also the reason why we are forbidden to eat all kinds of creeping creatures, as they are injurious to one\u2019s health. These same creatures, if eaten by gentiles, are not harmful to them. This is also the meaning of Psalms 147,19: \u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05d5 ,\u201d ,\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc. \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05df \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05d2\u05d5\u05d9, \u201cHe issus His commands to Yaakov, His statutes and rules to Israel; He did not do so for any other nation;\u201d The following is a true story involving the convert Onkelos, a nephew of the Roman Emperor Hadrianus, who when wishing to convert was afraid of the wrath of his uncle the Emperor. He told his uncle that he wished to engage in business, whereupon his uncle asked him if he was short of capital, in which case he was willing to help him out. He told his uncle that he wished to travel and find out which merchandise was both in demand and easy to obtain. His uncle told him to seek out a field which was presently in a recession so that he could invest at low prices and profit when market conditions would improve. As a result, he went to the land of Israel, at that time in a deep depression commercially, and studied Torah from the scholars prior to undergoing circumcision for becoming a convert. He was told that the words of Torah would only reside within him permanently if he circumcised himself first. He followed this advice, circumcised himself and studied a great deal of Torah. When Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua saw him, they noticed that his facial features had undergone a great change. They concluded that this was not Onkelos who had studied the Torah. When he began to ask the scholars questions, they told him that this was the result. When he returned to his uncle the Emperor, the latter asked him what had brought about the change in his facial features. He told him that he had studied the Torah and had himself circumcised. Upon being asked who had advised him to do this, he said: \u201cyou have.\u201d He explained that his uncle had told him to acquire merchandise which was in a depression and patiently wait until this merchandise would appreciate in value. He had visited many nations and not found a single one which was in such a state of depression as the Jewish nation, so that he became convinced that their fortunes would improve drastically. He quoted the prophet Isaiah 49,7 who had predicted this already more than five hundred years earlier. The Emperor slapped his face and asked him once more what had prompted him to convert to Judaism. He told him that actually, he had gone to study the Torah, but had been told that the condition for being taught Torah was that he had to be circumcised, just as Yaakov. He quoted Psalms 147,20 where it has been spelled out by the use of the word \u05d1\u05dc, that only the people of Israel had been endowed with Torah knowledge that could be retained. (Tanchuma, Mishpatim section 5)\n"}, "1": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e7\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9, \u201cif you acquire a Hebrew servant;\u201d according to Rashi, the scenario described here is that a thief who did not have the means to compensate his victim for what he had stolen, has been \u201csold\u201d (i.e. the value of his labour for six years) by the court which had convicted him. [A Jew\u2019s body cannot be sold by any court. Ed.] The procedure has been described in Exodus 22,2. Alternately, the person described in the Torah here has fallen on hard times and has sold his labour for six years to a \u201cmaster\u201d in order to pay off his creditors. If he had been \u201csold\u201d by the court he does not automatically leave his master\u2019s employment at the conclusion of six years service. Thus far Rashi on above verse. The problem is what prompted Rashi to write that someone sold by the court does not automatically conclude his service at the end of six years? We have a verse in Deuteronomy 15,12, according to which if someone who is a Jew or Jewess, has been \u201csold\u201d to you, his contract is valid for six years be he a male or a female. He is to be released at the end of that period, and his master is to provide him with a minimal stake to enable him to establish himself economically from that point. (verses 13-14 there) Clearly, that verse and its provisions do not apply to someone who had \u201csold\u201d himself but had been \u201csold\u201d by the court. Rashi there also comments that the person in question had been sold by someone other than himself. We must assume therefore that Rashi was explaining the commentary of the Mechilta, according to which the words: \u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e7\u05e0\u05d4 apply to the son or daughter of the original master, who had died during these years. The question is whether the contract can be inherited by the master\u2019s children, or in the event that the master did not leave behind any children, whether whosoever inherits the master\u2019s estate this includes the unexpired period of such a servant\u2019s contract. In the event that such a servant had been \u201csold\u201d by the court would the contract expire automatically with the death of the original purchaser? The wording in Deuteronomy, \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05de\u05db\u05e8 \u05dc\u05da, \u201cif he has been sold to you,\u201d as is distinct from the wording in our verse where the master is described as actively acquiring the servant, i.e. \u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e7\u05e0\u05d4, suggest that the two situations described are not identical. In Deuteronomy the period of service is spelled out as being six years, adding that in the seventh year such a servant has to be released unconditionally, whereas in Exodus, in our verse the Torah adds the same clause. In Deuteronomy the word (unnecessary) \u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05da, \u201che shall serve you\u201d is added. This reference to \u201cyou\u201d is absent in our verse here. In Leviticus 25,39, where the subject of an impoverished Israelite selling himself is first raised, the Torah does not speak of a term of 6 years but a period concluding with the Jubilee year, a year when all such forced sales of land or labour are automatically reversed. If such servants are not released until the Jubilee year, it stands to reason that they continue serving the son or daughter of their master if he passed away before the onset of the Jubilee year (once in 50 years). This means that the verse we are dealing with, commencing with the words: \u201cwhen you acquire, etc.,\u201d must apply to someone who had been sold by the court. If the Torah, in dealing with the acquisition of a Jewish servant, had only written the one verse on the subject in our portion, I might have thought that such a \u201cservant\u201d would have to continue serving upon the death of his master either his son or even his brother. To prevent us from misunderstanding this, the Torah had to write when speaking of a servant who had been sold by the court: \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05de\u05db\u05e8 \u05dc\u05da \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05da, \u201cwhen your brother has been sold to you,\u201d and it had to add: \u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05da \u05e9\u05e9 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cand he has to serve you, (the purchaser) for six years.\u201d This excludes any service to an heir of the purchaser. We therefore find that on the one hand the text implies something additional, and on the other hand it implies something less. The Rabbis therefore interpreted the addition as being the heir if he is a son or a daughter, but excluding the brother in the event the master did not leave behind a son or daughter in the event that the servant had been sold by the court. We find in the Talmud, tractate Kiddushin, folio 17 that the Talmud asks what forces us to include as heir the son, while at the same time excluding the heir when he is a brother, i.e. not a direct descendant. The answer given is that a son takes the place of his father when it comes to inheriting landed property or a maidservant whom the father may assign to his son to inherit as maidservant, (wife) when of age. (Compare Leviticus 27,20 and Talmud tractate Erchin folio 25.) [At this point our author refers to Rashi saying that the whole concept of the servant leaving his master\u2019s forced employment is a chidush, something not derived from standard methods of interpreting the Torah\u2019s laws, and he proceeds to suggest that it could be a g\u2019zeyrah shaveh, an accepted method of interpretation. As I have not found in my editions of Rashi, any reference to his saying that there is a chidush, I\u2019ll skip this. Ed.]\n", "2": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05e2\u05de\u05d5, \u201chis wife will leave that master\u2019s employment with him (at the same time). Rashi asks correctly, granted that we have been told that his wife leaves with him, but where did we hear that this applies to his children? As an answer he cites the Talmud, tractate Kiddushin folio 22, that we learn from this verse that the master of the servant of which the Torah speaks here is obligated to look after the servant\u2019s wife\u2019s and family\u2019s needs, if he had such when he was sold to him. Whereas it is clear that the master has to look after such a servants\u2019 wife, it does not appear clear from the text that he is also obligated to look after the children of such a servant. We need to find a nuance in the text that would support this contention. Our author therefore suggests that this can be found in Leviticus 25,41, where the subject is someone who was forced to sell his labour as he had fallen on hard times, debts, etc; the Torah there states that the \u201cmaster\u201d must release both him and his family in the Jubilee year, showing that there is an unnecessary word. The word \u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05e8 appears both in Leviticus and that same word appears again in Deut. 15,18. The scholars that do not accept this g\u2019zeyrah shaveh as something that is traditional, but simply consider (Talmud Kiddushin there) the phrasing of the verse as sufficient.", "3": "\u05d0\u05dd \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cif his master etc.\u201d here the Torah authorises the master of this Hebrew (unmarried) servant to give him one of his Canaanite slave-women as a \u201cwife\u201d to have children with, provided he had previously been married to a Jewish wife. If this \u201cservant\u201d had previously not been married, he cannot force him to enter into such a relationship with a Canaanite woman. This ruling is based on the words in verse 3: \u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2\u05e4\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d2\u05e4\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d0, \u201dif he came as a bachelor, he will leave as a bachelor.\u201d The reason underlying this legislation is that if he had previously been married to a Jewish woman he will not feel attracted to a Canaanite slave woman.\n", "4": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05e6\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05e6\u05e2, \u201chis master must pierce his ear with an awl;\u201d why did the Torah choose the awl as the tool with which to pierce this servant\u2019s ear? The numerical value of the letters in the word \u05de\u05e8\u05e6\u05e2 equals 400. It is to remind that servant that seeing that G\u2019d had redeemed the Jewish people from 400 years of slavery, it is unbelievable that he should choose being enslaved to a human master voluntarily. G\u2019d had stated categorically in Leviticus 25,55 \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cfor the Children of Israel are meant to be bound by a master- servant relationship only with their G\u2019d,\u201d not with any human being.

This is totally erroneous, as nowhere did we read that a father may \u201csell\u201d a son, and to draw a comparison from the text in Deuteronomy 15,12, where a male Israelite is described as \u201cselling\u201d himself is quite absurd. If that verse would speak about a minor boy, say an orphan, selling himself. This would be legally completely invalid as minors cannot do such a thing in Jewish law.

If you were to ask what did it cost her master to give her the 400 dollars, seeing that he had received the correct percentage of the work performed? The answer is that the girl\u2019s services becoming worth more every year she grew closer to adulthood, the master had paid her for work performed while she was too young to be worth what he had paid for.

Without our verse one could have thought that killing a woman or injuring her, or doing so to a hermaphrodite would not be punishable, or would be punishable less severely. Rashi explains all this on verse 16 in our chapter.", "9": "\u05d5\u05de\u05db\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05d5, \u201cand if someone strikes his father or his mother;\u201d the Torah here spells out the penalty, i.e. legal execution, without even having informed us that this is forbidden, an unusual construction. This question is raised by the Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin, folio 54. We have a rule that no court can convict a sinner except where the Torah has warned us of the sin in question being a sin. Granted that in the case of someone cursing a crowned head or even a deaf person who cannot even hear the curse, is forbidden, i.e. both a low-ranking person and a high ranking person must not be cursed, it is obvious that the same rule applies to social strata in between, and therefore each strata does not need to be written separately; compare (Exodus 22,7 and Leviticus 19,7) but where did the Torah spell out the prohibition to strike a human being without the penalty being spelled out simultaneously? We must fall back on Deuteronomy 25,3, where the Torah warns the court\u2019s clerk not to apply more than the permitted number of lashes to a person convicted of these. If in the case where the physical punishment is mandatory even a minutely excessive force is specifically forbidden, it is clear that striking someone without the consent or even instruction by the court is forbidden, how much more so is striking someone without such legal cover forbidden! In fact, concerning the subject of physical punishment, the halachah is according to the view of Rabbi Meir, who said that if someone is guilty of two penalties, both physical punishment and a financial penalty, (and we do not apply both for the same sin) the physical punishment is not administered. (Talmud, tractate Ketuvot, folio 32) The only exception is if the financial penalty amounts to less that the lowest coin in circulation at the time in the country. In this respect, the halachah does not treat sins committed against father or mother differently from offences committed against someone else. If you were to ask that seeing the verse deals with the prohibition of striking one\u2019s father, a sin which carries the death penalty, how could anyone have even imagined that the penalty would be 39 lashes, seeing that we have a rule that physical lashes are never an option for committing such a sin, (compare Talmud tractate Makkot folio 13), the answer is that we have two different expressions in the verse dealing with that subject in Deuteronomy 25,3. It says both: \u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05db\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e3,, as well as \u05e4\u05df \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e3 \u05dc\u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05db\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d4, \u201cforty lashes he may give him, he must nor exceed this,\u201d and \u201clest he should exceed above by inflicting a severe wound, etc.;\u201d     you may also argue that seeing the subject in our chapter deals with inflicting wounds, how could the penalty be one of execution by a court? How would I know that if the blow administered did not result in a visible wound that it would be punishable altogether? Furthermore, when the Torah speaks about cursing father and mother (Leviticus 20,9) execution is the penalty, how could it occur to anyone to think that the penalty would be 39 lashes? We would have to look at Leviticus 24,21 where the Torah decrees the death penalty for striking a human being, any human being, i.e. \u05d5\u05de\u05db\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05ea, \u201cif he strikes a human being she shall be executed!\u201d On that verse Rashi felt compelled to explain that the human being meant in that verse is one\u2019s father, and that the reason is to contrast and to compare the penalty for striking animals and striking one\u2019s father, where the former is punishable only by financial compensation to the owner of that animal. We could conclude that just as when said animal did not die from its wounds only a financial penalty is imposed, the same would be true for striking human being who does not die a result. The Torah therefore wrote the word \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05ea, \u201che shall be executed,\u201d to show that the verse speaks of a human being who is the father of the man who struck him.(Compare Rashi on that verse.) It is not possible to say that the Torah there speaks of someone who had struck one\u2019s father after he was dead, but the verse speaks of living animals and a living father being the victim. What is the difference between \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05ea and \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05ea, the usual term for legal execution? The former refers to a financial penalty, just as in Exodus 21,29, where the owner is not executed, but the Torah uses this word to show that he deserves to be executed. We know this as previously the Torah had written: \u05db\u05df \u05d9\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05d1\u05d5, \u201cthus it shall be rendered to him.\u201d (verse 20) This was a clear reference to a financial penalty. In light of the above, we must understand the word \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05ea in Leviticus 20,9 as having been meant literally and applying to someone who struck his father or mother.\n", "10": "\u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9, but if someone kidnaps a person, etc.\u201d the reason why this scenario is written between the verses where striking a father a or cursing him is written, is because the penalty for striking a father or kidnapping a person is death by strangulation, while the penalty for cursing one\u2019s father is by stoning (more severe). In Leviticus 20,9, the penalty for cursing is described both as \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05ea, \u201che is sure to be executed,\u201d plus the additional words: \u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d5, \u201chis blood(guilt) is upon him.\u201d Although we might have thought that cursing one\u2019s parent should carry a lighter sentence than physically assaulting him, seeing it does not involve an act, whereas striking includes an act of violence, the Torah decreed a more severe penalty for the cursing of one\u2019s parent, i.e. death by stoning. According to the Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin, folio 49, the reason why a severe type of death penalty is applied for cursing one\u2019s parents, is that the Torah compares the parents as deserving a similar degree of honour as that shown to G\u2019d, seeing that the parents brought you into this world. Cursing G\u2019d is punishable by stoning as we know from the blasphemer in Leviticus 24,14. Seeing that it impossible to strike G\u2019d, any comparison with striking a parent is inappropriate. Hence the death penalty for that sin is chenek, strangulation. Furthermore, when someone was guilty of cursing his parents after they had died he is still guilty of the same sin, whereas if the same person had struck his father after he had died the death penalty does not apply, as it was part of the penalties listed for causing injury (Compare Mechilta Mishpatim, section 5.). It is impossible to inflict an injury upon someone who is already dead. Our author asks that if one cannot inflict injury after death and therefore the death penalty by stoning is not applied, why is the same not true of someone who cursed G\u2019d, seeing it is impossible to harm Him in any way? Perhaps the fact that the subject of cursing G\u2019d, and the penalty for this appears next to the subject of the blasphemer in Leviticus chapter 24, makes my question irrelevant.", "11": "\u05d0\u05da \u05d0\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cbut if he survives for a day or two, etc.\u201d Rashi commenting on verse 20, explains that the subject in that verse was either a Canaanite slave or slave-woman, and that our verse was necessary to describe under what circumstances the scenario described here has been exempted from the general rule applying to someone who struck his Canaanite slave, fatally, with an object that could be assumed to cause death. If death was delayed by at least 24 hours, the master is not treated as a murderer, but as someone who had disciplined someone whom he owned physically. [At this point the author engages in a discussion of the applicability of two closely related principles of Torah exegesis, known as the thirteen principles of Rabbi Yishmael, something extremely complicated for anyone not familiar with these principles. This editor does not think that he is qualified to explain this adequately to his readers, and has decided that rather than to confuse the reader he will omit this. He points to what Rashi himself has written in his commentary on verse 12, that he will endeavour to explain this legislation and why it appears so many times in the Torah, each time in a slightly different format. If even Rashi felt this way, this editor may be forgiven for preferring to skip part of this.

According to the scholar who holds that these words here are not to be taken literally, but that what is meant is a financial penalty/compensation, to be paid by the perpetrator. The third opinion in the Talmud, Tanna de bey Chiskiyah, holds that the perpetrator does not even have to pay a financial penalty to the heirs of the victim. This opinion is expressed in the tractate Baba Kamma, folio 35, and is based on the following interpretation of our verse: The words: \u05d0\u05dd \u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05df \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cif a mishap will occur,\u201d are referring to the woman pregnant with child, not to her fetus; then the rule \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, \u201ca life for a life is applied,\u201d seeing she, a living human being had been killed. The author adds that it appears to him that what went wrong here was that the killer had intended to kill the man he was fighting with, but had erroneously killed this woman. If we had not had this verse we might have thought that no death penalty would apply seeing that what he had intended to do had not been carried out; the Torah therefore repeats this expression \u201ca life for a life,\u201d to remind us that regardless of who had been killed by him he deserves death for having intended to kill a human being, something he had intended to do, and something which carries the death penalty.\n", "13": "\u05dc\u05d7\u05e4\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5, \u201che must set him free;\u201d even if he had only knocked out one of his Canaanite slaves\u2019 teeth. According to a Midrash, (asking the rhetorical question) will such a slave really be given his freedom just because he lost as tooth? The answer given is as follows: Cham, the son of Noach was cursed by G\u2019d, [actually his son, seeing that he had previously been blessed by G\u2019d and that blessing could not be nullified Ed.] for having seen his father naked, and having told his brothers instead of covering him. In our verse, the subject, the master of the slave, had actually deprived his slave of a tooth or an eye, no wonder that the Torah applies a financial penalty to the master by decreeing that he release the slave (whose market value is basically 30 shekel).\n", "14": "\u05e1\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc \u05d9\u05e1\u05e7\u05dc \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cthe (offending) ox must be stoned to death.\u201d Rashi claims that from the words above we would not know that its flesh would be prohibited as food. This sounds very strange, seeing that it has not been killed by ritual slaughter, it is what is known as neveilah, and all animals that died other than by ritual slaughter are automatically forbidden to us as food. What did Rashi think that the words: \u201cits meat must not be eaten\u201d was needed for? It could be needed for a situation in which the ox in question had been ritually slaughtered after being convicted to die by stoning, before the decree could be carried out. In that event our verse insures that it will not allow the guilty party to circumvent the court\u2019s decision, seeing that ritual slaughter could not be carried out on a dead animal. If you were to say that the prohibition here refers to the fetus found inside an animal that had been ritually slaughtered and was either close to be born, and comes out alive, or it had been carried for the full term of pregnancy and was dead, and the Torah decreed that ritual slaughter of the mother was not sufficient to permit this ben pekuah to be eaten, as is, it is considered as having died from natural causes and therefore cannot be eaten, the words \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc, teach that it must not only not be eaten, but no other use may be made of it either.", "15": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d2\u05d7 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0, \u201cbut if that ox had had a history of goring people, (and its owner had not taken proper precautions);\u201c The Talmud, tractate Baba Kamma folio 23, relates a dispute between two scholars, Abbaye and Rava whether the term \u05e0\u05d2\u05d7 applies to an ox that already gored twice or whether even after having gored once, that animal belongs to the category of being potential a killer, and its owner being guilty of not having protected potential victims properly. The subject of their dispute is the meaning of the word \u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05dc, usually understood to mean \u201cyesterday.\u201d According to the former scholar, even a single incident of goring suffices for the ox to be categorised as dangerous, and the prefix \u05de i.e. \u05de\u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05dc, would refer to the second offense by that ox, so that the words \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cand its owner did not watch it adequately,\u201d would make him liable to stoning only the fourth time whereas according to the second scholar, basing himself on the word \u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05dd, \u201cday before yesterday,\u201d that ox\u2019s status did not change from harmless to dangerous until after it had gored three times. According to Rava, the words \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5, would then mean that only after a third such occurrence did this ox change its category, and its owner became guilty on an additional count According to the Talmud in tractate Baba batra, folio 28, such an ox is subject to stoning only after it has gored the fourth time. seems therefore that Abaye found four sources in the Torah\u2019s text supporting his view whereas Rava found only three. If you were to ask what difference this makes, [after all we do not decide questions of halachah on the written text of the Torah, but use it only as broad hints, Ed.] Rabbi Ezra hanavi claims that there is a difference. The difference would be if the fourth goring had occurred on the same day as the third goring. According to Abbaye, if the last goring would have occurred on the same day as the previous one, the owner as well as his ox would not be held liable for the additional negligence, as the owner on a day when his ox was bad-tempered had not yet had time to place him under secure restraint.", "16": "\u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthirty shekel.\u201d This is an arbitrary amount determined by the Torah, as clearly the value in terms of ability to perform work varies from person to person. We already have a hint of this on the first occasion when the Torah ever mentions a \u201cslave,\u201d in Genesis 9,25, where the Torah writes, concerning Canaan, son of Cham that he is to be a slave to slaves, and the extra word \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4, \u201che will be,\u201d is added there. The numerical value of that word is 30, as if to tell us that this is a fixed amount regardless of the physical strength of that servant.", "17": "\u05d5\u05e0\u05e4\u05dc \u05e9\u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cand an ox falls into that pit;\u201d (because it was not covered); Rashi explains that the Torah chose the ox as an example which applies to all other domestic animals also. Wherever the word \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 occurs in the Torah, it serves as an example applicable to other domestic animals. When both \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 and \u05d7\u05de\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cox and donkey\u201d are mentioned, what is meant is \u201can ox as opposed to a human being,\u201d and the word \u05d7\u05de\u05d5\u05e8, donkey, is meant to be contrasted with \u201cinert vessels.\u201d If you were to argue that the word \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8  at least once, is needed in order to establish its connection to the Sabbath laws where the Torah wrote in Exodus 23,12 that \u201cyour ox must rest on the Sabbath,\u201d the answer is that unless we were to deduce from the repeated use of these types of animals and no others that they were meant to exclude human beings and inert vessels from the respective legislation under discussion, the Torah did not have to use either example, and simply write that something will fall into the pit, without listing any example. If this is so, i.e. that the word \u05d5\u05e0\u05e4\u05dc, \u201cit falls,\u201d includes both ox, donkey, etc.; just as these words do in connection with the Sabbath rest to be observed by the possessions of a Jew on the Sabbath, the words \u201cox\u201d and \u201cdonkey\u201d are available for teaching us additional rules. Nonetheless, it is still difficult to understand why the Torah chose as its examples animals and not human beings that would fall into the pit of which our verse speaks. This can be deduced from the words: \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5, \u201cand the carcass will be his;\" i.e. he who owned this animal while alive is permitted to make use of its carcass other than consuming it. This makes clear that the owner of the offending animal is not permitted to make any use of the animal or vessel his ox had killed or destroyed. This has been pointed out already in the Jerusalem Talmud in connection with a different problem, namely if an owner of a Canaanite slave who has not yet been circumcised and undergone immersion in a ritual bath, is permitted to start working for his owner. The reason why the dead animal is forbidden to be made any use of is derived from Deuteronomy 21,1 where the subject of the heifer that is killed as symbolic atonement for the people in whose vicinity an anonymous person had been murdered, their declaring that he had not been denied food or shelter in their town. In that verse the Torah uses the apparently unnecessary word \u05e9\u05dd, \u201cthere,\u201d as it does in connection with the death of Miriam in Numbers 20,1. The rabbis conclude from these two unnecessary words, that just as a human carcass is forbidden to be made any use of, so it is forbidden to make any use of the carcass of the heifer discussed in Deuteronomy 21,4. [This editor does not understand why the author ever assumed that a human being could have served as the example in our verse, as when a human being falls into a pit the person who had failed to cover it is not responsible, as human beings have been given eyes to see with and a brain to use to watch where they are going.] (Compare Rashi, who contrasts \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 with \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd, i.e. no compensation is payable for human beings who fall into the pit.] The Talmud in tractate Avodah zarah folio 29, quotes the school of Yannai as saying that the reason why such making use of the dead is prohibited, is that death is associated with atonement, i.e. \u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e2\u05de\u05da \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201cgrant atonement for Your people of Israel,\u201d [so that they will regain their status as being holy, Ed.] and just as something holy must not be used for a secular use, so also the dead who have achieved forgiveness through having died, and have recaptured their former status as innocent holy beings."}, "21": {"0": "\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05ea\u05e8\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d1, \u201cif the thief is discovered while tunneling, underground, etc.;\u201d the scenario described here where the owner of the house being burgled kills the intruder, and the Torah exonerates him, applies only when the thief had made an effort to remain undiscovered.

(Exodus chapter 32). The word \u05e9\u05d4 in this verse is understood by that Midrash as applying to the Jewish people in Jeremiah 50,17 where he called them \u05e9\u05d4 \u05e4\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, \u201cscattered sheep.\u201d The words: \u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4, \u201cfor a raiment,\u201d are a metaphor for idolatry, a variant of the word \u05e6\u05dc\u05dd idolatrous image, the letter \u05e9 substituting for the letter \u05e6, and the vowel patach for the vowel tzeyreh. Both the letter \u05e6 and the vowel patach are used interchangeably in the Bible on other occasions.

Elsewhere, in the Talmud, tractate Baba Metzia folio 41, Rashi adds that even if the safe keeper had already returned the animal in question to its owner, seeing that he had illegally made use of it while it was under his care, any accident that will befall that animal will be considered as the result of that offense he had committed. According to Rabbeinu Tam, -Rashi\u2019s grandson,- this presents a difficulty, seeing that in our verse the Torah had written that no one had witnessed the accident that had happened to said animal, i.e. we de do not even know if the circumstances were such that they could be attributed to the safe-keeper\u2019s illegal actions. [All we know is that it occurred while the safe-keeper had not been present, as he should have been. Ed.] According to Rabbeinu Tam, the wording of the Torah implies that if the safe-keeper had witnesses who had seen that he had not been negligent or done something illegal as a result of which the accidents had become possible, he is not held responsible. According to Rashi what use would it be for the safe-keeper if there even was \u201cproof\u201d that he had not been at fault, seeing that the Torah requires the safe-keeper to swear an oath that he had not done anything which according to Torah law was not permissible? According to Rashi, even a true oath would not be helpful for the person who had sworn it, so why should he use the name of the Lord in vain? Besides, how could the \u201cwitnesses\u201d know if the accused had ever committed an illegal use of what had been entrusted to him for safekeeping, if that person had in the meantime replaced the animal in the pen where he had kept it locked up?

If we needed any proof that its wood was very light, consider the size of the boards of the Tabernacle\u2019s which were 48 in number. Add two silver sockets for each board, i.e. 96 sockets, add all the upright boards use to surround the courtyard of the Tabernacle, which all had to be transported only by four wagons pulled by eight oxen, as spelled out in Numbers 4,29. Even though each board was 10 cubits high (6 meters) and their thickness was 1 cubit (60cm) and you will realise that unless the wood itself was extremely light, all of this could not have been pulled by only eight oxen. The other four oxen had to pull the weight of the carpets (4 layers) which formed the \u201croof\u201d of the Tabernacle. We have been told in addition that the \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05df, (Exodus 36,33), the center bolt, used to be Yaakov\u2019s walking staff, the one with which he had crossed the river Jordan on his way to Lavan. Rashi claims that the shittim wood were trees that Yaakov had planted in Egypt as soon as he had come to Egypt, which the Israelites uprooted and took with them when departing from Egypt and which were used now to make the boards for the Tabernacle from. This is also what the liturgist bases himself on. Another interpretation found in the Midrash is that this was wood from the staff Yaakov had .taken with him on the way to Lavan. [I suppose that what the Midrash means is that Yaakov had planted that walking staff in the earth in Charan already, and it had developed. Ed.] This is why he had referred to it in Genesis 32,11, as a symbol of G\u2019d\u2019s providence guiding him during all the years he had been at Lavan.

Also the firewood for the altar should have been mentioned, and the animals that were needed to be offered on the altar. Why was only the oil singled out? It is possible to answer this by saying that seeing that the oils for anointing was also used to anoint all the furnishings in the Tabernacle before they could perform their function, this oil had multiple functions and was not only used for providing the raw material from which lighting was supplied for the Tabernacle which had no windows. The same is true of the incense. In a king\u2019s palace, in our physical universe, before the King enters it with a view to take up his residence, different pleasant smelling spices are scattered to dissipate remnants of unpleasant odours that had accumulated during its construction. It is clear therefore that no less would be done when a structure housing the presence of the shechinah, presence of the Creator would be made ready for His occupancy. We find that indeed the presence of the Lord in the Tabernacle was made possible only through the presence of the incense, i.e. the fragrance released by it through burning it; this thought has been spelled out in Leviticus 16,13: \u05d5\u05db\u05e1\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e0\u05df \u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea, \u201cand the cloud of incense is to envelop the Holy Ark,\u201d as well as again in verse 2 of the same chapter: \u05db\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e0\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05db\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea, \u201cfor I appear in the cloud upon the cover of the Ark.\u201d Even though the oil of which the Torah speaks here is not required for physical illumination in the Tabernacle, it reflects the honour paid to the Holy Presence of the celestial presence in the midst of the Jewish people.\n", "4": "\u05d0\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d4\u05dd, \u201conyx stones;\u201d these, and the jewels which follow, were required for the breastplate and the epaulets of the garments of the High Priest.

The reason that it was not all gold, was that gold is very heavy and the Holy Ark plus its contents had to be carried on the Levites\u2019 shoulders. [Even as it was, according to a calculation by Rabbi Eliyahu ki tov, the weight was 78000lbs. Ed.] The reader will wonder how a few Levites could possibly carry even such a weight, and having this in mind the Talmud in tractate Sotah folio 35, states that far from the Levites carrying the Ark, the Ark was transporting its carriers. [Especially while the entire nation crossed the river Jordan under the command of Joshua and the Levites carrying the Ark had to position themselves in a manner which would stop the waters of the Jordan flowing south until the last man had crossed.] (Joshua 3,17) Normally, and for brief periods, the Levites were able to carry the Ark, (with G\u2019d\u2019s help, of course, as when Yaakov rolled away a stone that several shepherds had been unable to move as much as an inch.) Our author questions that if carrying the Ark on their shoulders was a command that applied only on a certain occasion, why was Uzza punished when he tried to steady the wagon transporting the Ark. (Chronicles I 13,9-10, as well as Samuel II 6,7) He leaves the question unanswered. [The Talmud there even states that Uzzah went straight to the world to come, as a reward for his noble intention, I suppose. Ed.] Not only the Ark, but also the Table and the \u201cgolden\u201d altar were not made of solid gold but their wooden base was overlaid with gold plate both from the outside and the inside. The same applied to the copper altar, which also had to be carried on the shoulders of the Levites during the journeys in the desert. (Compare Exodus 21,1) [This editor sees no contradiction in all this, as until the 40th year in the desert the Israelites lived on miracles, miracle water, miracle bread, clothing that did not wear out, complete protection against heat and cold by special clouds, etc. This only changed partially during the fortieth year when they conquered land, flocks and herds, etc. Presumably, crossing the Jordan river, brought that period to an end, as immediately after that the commandment to set aside challah from dough made from grain that had grown in the Holy Land, became applicable.

As soon as they would have deposited it at its next destination, the bearers would immediately step away from it in order not to become ritually impure by any misstep they might make.

The width of the altar, also five cubits, was to allude to the second of the Tablets; its height of three cubits was to allude to the three redeemers, i.e. Moses, Aaron and Miriam. Some commentators see in the measurement of three cubits for its height a reference to how much it rose above what has been described as \u05e8\u05e9\u05ea, a brass network, which was part of the altar\u2019s walls.

The \u201croof\u201d of this altar was five cubits square (external measurements, i.e. approximately three meters) The usable surface therefore was diminished by 60 centimeters at each corner where the corner posts, known as \u201chorns\u201d were positioned. The area comprising one cube square in the center of the roof of this altar was where the maaracha, the firewood for burning the sacrificial animals was kept. Even though the Torah does not spell out the details of the ramp leading to the top of the altar, it is understood that there was such a ramp, as it was forbidden to ascend the altar by means of steps. (Exodus 20,23) This ramp was at the south side of the altar rising northward. The Talmud in tractate Z\u2019vachim, folio 62 explains why it was impossible for that ramp to have been positioned elsewhere."}, "1": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05ea, \u201cyou will construct on that network, etc.;\u201d these rings were meant to enable the Levites to insert the staves into by which the altar would be transported, carried by the Levites. Rabbi Yechiel, pointing to a statement in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat, folio 92, raised the problem that according to the Talmud, anyone carrying a load at a level of higher than ten handbreadths (on the Sabbath) should be guilty of having committed a violation seeing that the sons of Kehat who carried the Holy Ark on their shoulders, certainly carried it more than ten handbreadths above ground level. The Talmud there proves that the rings through which the staves for carrying the Tabernacle\u2019s furnishings were carried were attached at two thirds of the height of the respective holy vessel. The height of the Levites supposedly was eighteen handbreadths including their respective heads. It follows that anything they carried on their shoulders was already much higher than that. [Rabbi Yechiel did not refer to the Levites being guilty of carrying something in the desert, seeing that the Israelites, of course, did not travel in the desert on the Sabbath. What he questioned was that the public domain is never considered as being more than ten handbreadths above ground level, so that anyone carrying a load on the Sabbath at a level higher than ten handbreadths cannot be culpable for violating the Sabbath. Seeing that the Levites carried loads at a higher level than that, and the desert where the Israelites were was certainly considered a public domain, how could our sages have restricted the concept of \u201cpublic domain\u201d to as little as ten handbreadths above ground level. Ed.] In light of all the above, how could the Talmud have derived the limitation of the height of the concept \u201cpublic domain\u201d by using the altar as its example? The Levites\u2019 shoulders were fifteen handbreadths high, and the part of the altar that stuck out beyond their heads was way beyond ten handbreadths above ground. We would have to say that the Talmud\u2019s statement is to be taken as proof that the rings fastened to the network were at a level lower than two thirds of the altar and that only the upper third was above the rings, or at least no more than half its height. If so, the rule that the public domain does not extend beyond a height of then handbreadths can be used for the Sabbath, the level of the network of the altar serving as proof.\n", "2": "\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d4 \u05d7\u05de\u05e9 \u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cand it height five cubits\u201d (15 handbreadths).

If you accept the opinion of the scholar (Talmud, tractate Z\u2019vachim folio 60) who claims that the altar was ten cubits (60 handbreadths) high, the priests performing the service in the Temple Compound on the copper altar were visible to anyone beyond these hangings. [What were the hangings needed for then? Ed] We would have to answer that the height given by the Torah for these hangings was not measured from the ground up, but from the ledge of the altar, so that overall it was fifteen cubits high. Rabbi Yitzchok, son of Avraham posed a different question: If, as according to the plain meaning of our text, the hangings were only five cubits high, even the entrance gate to Solomon\u2019s Temple was five cubits higher than these hangings, and what purpose would they serve? He concluded therefore that whereas the hangings to the south and north of the entrance gate were indeed fifteen cubits high, i.e. five cubits higher that the hangings on the other sides of the Tabernacle. In other words, their total height was twenty cubits. The entrance gate was also twenty cubits high.\n", "3": "\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8, \u201cfrom evening to the next morning;\u201d according to Rashi, this means that the menorah\u2019s lights are to burn from nightfall to sunrise, the amount of oil in each lamp being calculated according to the length of the night in the month of Kislev. The amount of oil required was half a log, and although there would be oil left over during the summer months, no attention was paid to that. Rabbi Yitzchok son of Avraham, of blessed memory, does not accept this interpretation from Rashi as it would involve wasting holy oil. He therefore suggests that the wicks used in the summer were thicker than those in the winter months so that all the oil would be burned up. This is also why the Talmud, tractate Yuma folio 23, states that the material the wicks were made of was the discarded garments of the priests. [In other words, nothing was wasted if at all possible.

His grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, does not agree, seeing that an analysis will show that Dan was not listed in the order of the birth of the twelve tribes\u2019 births, seeing that he had been the fifth son born to Yaakov, and in the Book of Joshua 19,47, we read: \u201cthey called the name of the town according to the names of their forefather.\u201d It would appear therefore that what was meant in our verses here is that the names of the tribes appeared on the jewels of the Ephod in the sequence in which these sons had been born by their respective mothers. The sons of Leah are mentioned first in order of their births, followed by the sons of Bilhah, in accordance with their births, followed by the sons of Zilpah in accordance of their births, followed by the sons of Rachel. You will find that the jewel Leshem was that alluding to Dan, and the jewel yoshpah alluded to Binyamin. This is the way they appear in the liturgist\u2019s poem known as krovatz recited prior to the kedushah on Purim morning commencing with the words: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05df. The Talmud in tractate Sotah folio 36, has a different order. The names of the tribes appeared in a different order on the two jewels of the Ephod (epaulettes) worn by the High Priest. Some commentators were concerned with the total numbers of letters of the tribes\u2019 names being equally divided, i.e. 50 on one side of the Ephod and 50 on the other side. This, of course, would account for the names not appearing in the same order as the names on the breastplate. [As it is impossible at this stage to decide whose opinion is correct, I have not translated the balance of our author\u2019s remarks on the subject.

Rashi explains the words urim vetumim that the Torah describes as having been placed in the folds of the breastplate (verse 30), by writing that the word \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd explains the word \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8, which precedes it as meaning \u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cestablishment of legal rules,\u201d whereas the word \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05dd would refer to the \u201climits set for the application of all these rules.\u201d In practice, the High Priest during the period of Second Temple used the breastplate to obtain confirmation from G\u2019d rather than to obtain instructions from G\u2019d as in Isaiah 24,15:\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05db\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4' , \u201chonor the Lord with lights\u201d [Rashi speaks of the High Priest\u2019s breastplate during the time of the second Temple when the parchment with the tetragram from the first Temple was no longer in existence. During Moses\u2019 lifetime, Aaron never needed to use the urim vetumim in order to communicate with G\u2019d, as Moses spoke to G\u2019d directly. During the period after Moses\u2019 death and the destruction of the first Temple, the High Priest would address queries to G\u2019d and these would be answered by letters on the breastplate being illuminated, and these had to be interpreted by the High Priest. During the period of the second Temple, -if I understand this correctly,- the High Priest phrased his query so that it required to be answered either positively or negatively, and the letters for \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d would become illuminated. It is not known what Rashi\u2019s source was for writing that the parchment with the tetragram was kept in the folds of the breastplate.

Rabbi Yitzchok, son of Rabbi Avraham of blessed memory, questioned this statement by Rashi on the basis of what we learned in the Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin folio 83, where the Talmud derives this rule from Exodus 29,9, from the words: \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd \u05db\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u201cand they will remained consecrated as priests perpetually. The Talmud there understands these words as applying to when the priests wear their priestly garments. When they do not wear those garments, they are treated as if ordinary Israelites, who if they dare to enter the holy Temple become guilty of death. (Numbers 1,51) In order to answer the query by Rabbi Yitzchok, we are forced to say that our verse here adds the new dimension that even the trousers (though meant to cover the private parts) of the priests are considered as part of their uniform and their not wearing same as prescribed already makes them guilty of the death penalty.\n"}, "26": {"0": "'\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7 \u05e4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5, \u201ctake one young bullock, etc.\u201d take one ram on its left side and one ram on its right side and place the bullock in the middle. Why was Moses commanded to take these three animals? They were to symbolise the three founding fathers of the Jewish nation. The bullock symbolised Avraham, who had been described as \u201crunning to the stables containing the cattle,\u201d when he was about to prepare a meal for the three angels, one of whom predicted the birth of Yitzchok (Genesis18,7). The two rams represented Yitzchok and Yaakov. The unleavened breads in verse 23 accompanying these sacrifices symbolised Hagar and Sarah. Avraham had told Sarah to hurry and to prepare bread at the time. According to Rav Hunna son of Abba, one measure of wheat would be taken to be milled, and by the time the owner came home he found that he had one measure of fine flour and one measure of average quality of flour and one measure of coarse grain. He now brought only a little more than one measure of fine flour. The purpose of the libations accompanying the animal sacrifices was to ensure that the grape harvest would enjoy G\u2019d\u2019s blessing. The Talmud relates the following story. A certain Torah student left Jerusalem, and he was recognised as such by people whom he encountered (who apparently did not have a Torah scholar living in their town) They offered him three major gold coins in order for him to change his place of residence and to take up residence in their town. He declined the money and the offer accompanying it. He explained that he owned a vineyard that was more valuable than all the gold that they could offer him, as it yielded him more than six hundred barrels of wine annually which he could sell at a good price. He recounted that he had an orchard which was similarly generous in the yield of fruit it provided him with. He attributed his good fortune to his meticulously observing the commandment of bringing the first ripe fruit of each category to the Temple in Jerusalem each year, as an offering to G\u2019d (via the priest) Another story is related about a certain Yonathan son of Elazar, who witnessed while sitting under his fig-tree when the dew descended on that tree as a result of which he harvested great amounts of honey so much so that that when the wind mixed it with earth a female goat materialised and gave an abundance of milk. This Yonathan told his students that he wanted to show them a phenomenon which reflected the world to come in miniature. The moment he had finished saying this to his students all the aforementioned examples of material wealth on this earth vanished, in accordance with the prophet Chagai 1,6 who had said: \u05d6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d1\u05d0 \u05de\u05e2\u05d8, \u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4, \u05e9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05e9\u05db\u05e8\u05d4, \u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05e9 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5, \u201cyou have sown much and brought in little; you eat without being satisfied; you drink without getting your fill; you clothe yourselves without getting warm.\u201d [Yonathan then realised that he had erred greatly when boasting about material blessings he had enjoyed, and using these as a reason why not moving to a town that did not have a resident Torah scholar. Ed.] We find a similar message in Jeremiah 8,13. These blessings were all denied the Jewish people when they saw in them rewards for fulfillment of certain commandments in the Torah. We are not to observe the Torah for such a reward, although fulfillment of the commandments is accompanied by a certain amount of material blessings encouraging us to continue to do so.

[In both instances only one animal is being sacrificed, so why would Aaron and his sons all place their hands on that one ram? Ed.] Also in verse 19 the Torah again reverts to using the singular mode for that word although the subjects are both Aaron and his sons. It appears that according to the Midrash on verse 15 the word Aaron has also been spelled with the additional letter \u05d5; according to Rashi, commenting on a similar anomaly of the spelling of the word \u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05d8\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea once with the plural letter \u05d5 and once without, (Exodus 13,16, Deuteronomy 6,7 and 11,18 respectively).

[Sanctification is used here in the negative sense of the word, out of bounds for anyone else. Ed.]. In order to forestall our getting the wrong impression, the verse following spelling out an example of an animal qualified as a sacrifice, teaches that was meant in verse 37 were only animals basically qualified as sacrifices, which had incurred a disqualification after being on the sacred grounds of the Temple. It is worth examining why in this verse the burnt offering has not been mentioned by name. Presumably, the Torah thought that the reader would understand that the verse speaks of a burnt offering, the name \u201cburnt offering\u201d having been spelled out in verse 44 of our chapter. Our author feels that this is a somewhat forced answer and that there is no need for such a forced answer. He suggests instead that seeing that our verse speaks of an offering tendered twice on each day, that the reader surely knows that this could only refer to a burnt offering. The details about this offering have been spelled out in Numbers 28,3. Our author raises a question involving a commentary by Rashi on the portion dealing with the daily burnt offerings. (Numbers 28,4) On the words: \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d1\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05ea\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8, \u201cyou shall present the one sheep in the morning,\u201d he writes: that this has been repeated there although it has already been recorded here, as here it referred to a one time event, the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests, [subsequent priests being born as such to their respective fathers and not needing consecration; Ed.] The paragraph in Numbers refers to legislation that is permanent, and remained in force as long as a Temple functioned. [This editor refers the reader to an interesting comment by K\u2019lee yakar on why in the one verse the Torah speaks about \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3, \u201cone,\u201d whereas in the other portion dealing with the basically same sacrifice the Torah used the prefix \u05d4, i.e. \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05d3, \u201cthe one.\u201d] Our author feels that there was another occasion when the priests had to be consecrated in the time of Ezra when the second Temple had been consecrated and the claim of someone being a priest had to be documented anew due to the seventy years of exile the Jews had endured when not all could prove their ancestry beyond doubt. It will again become necessary to do so when the messiah will come, hopefully soon in our time. Our author feels that this is why Rashi in referring to the consecration rites never mentions a word about these being unique in Jewish history.\n"}, "27": {"0": "\u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5, \u201con its two sides.\u201d According to Rashi, what is meant here are the two corners of each side of the (golden) altar to which the rings had been fastened. Apparently, there were four rings which had been fastened to the four corners. This appears problematic. Seeing that the dimensions of the golden altar were only one cubit in length and one cubit in width, (60cm by 60cm), how could two men stand behind one another supporting the staves of this altar when carrying it? When explaining the position of the rings and the staves attached to the Holy Ark, it was understood that they were attached to the two long sides of the Ark, which were two and a half cubits long each. The reason they carried it in such a fashion was that the alternative, namely carrying it on the short sides which were one and a half cubits wide, (50% longer than the golden altar\u2019s sides) was not considered long enough to enable two men to walk behind each other while carrying it, The only way we can understand Rashi, would be that only two men carried that altar, one on each side. They must have positioned themselves between the walls of the altar and the wooden staves supported by the rings through which they had been inserted.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea, \u201cand Aaron shall burn on it the incense;\u201d the word \u201cAaron\u201d cannot be understood literally, as he would not live forever.

The reason he has been mentioned by name is that according to the Talmud in tractate Yuma, folio 26, whenever the High Priest demanded to offer the incense he took precedence over ordinary priests. The Talmud there describes the procedure used to determine which priest would be chosen each day for that task. One of the most important factors in choosing such a priest was if he had never had the opportunity to perform that duty he was given preference over his colleagues. There was a tradition according to which priests who had performed this duty would become wealthy. Normally, lots were drawn between the priests on duty on that particular day. Lighting the menorah, also described as being performed by Aaron in Exodus 27,21, was also permitted to be performed by ordinary priests, seeing that both Aaron and his sons are mentioned in that context.\n", "2": "\u05de\u05d7\u05e6\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05e7\u05dc, \u201ca coin worth half a shekel.\u201d This was to atone for the half day they had been guilty of not doing something to destroy the golden calf, as explained in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 89.

The coin known as shekel (a silver coin) is valued as twenty geyrah, (copper coins). They had been guilty of transgressing all of the Ten Commandments, as transgressing the prohibition of idolatry is equivalent to transgressing all of the commandments of the Torah. The Talmud in tractate Z\u2019vachim, quotes the oldest kabbalistic text, Pirke de rabbi Eliezer, chapter 48, where Rabbi Yishmael describes the five \u201cfingers\u201d on G\u2019d\u2019s right hand, as all involved in the process of redemption.

The Talmud, (Rosh hashanah, folio 11) is of two opinions as to when the universe as we know it was created, whether in the fall, on Rosh Hashanah, or in the spring, the month in which we celebrate Passover. [Since none of us was around at the time neither scholar could prove his point. Ed.] According to the opinion that the universe was created in Tishrey, we have no problem reconciling the figures given here and the ones given seven months later in the Book of Numbers. According to the second opinion, the report in the Torah is difficult to reconcile, seeing that the totals of the two censuses which clearly took place at an interval of seven moths, i.e. the first one immediately after the golden calf and the second one in the second month (Iyar) after the erection of the Tabernacle, which had been erected in the first month (Nissan) of the second year and produced the same result. This question is reinforced as supposedly the ages of the people were based on the ages on the history of mankind having been based on the years that the first human being, Adam, had lived. According to that opinion only a single census could have taken place. If so, it is possible that seeing that the total was based on the census in that year, the Torah considered the people counted retroactively as having been 20 years of age already in Tishrey of the previous year. Seeing that from the count reported here the sockets for the Tabernacle which had been erected in the sockets of the Tabernacle had been made it must have taken place before the Tabernacle had been erected.

Turnusrufus then wanted to know why that same G\u2019d performs all manner of work on the Sabbath, such as letting the wind blow, the rain fall, etc., whereas He denied the Jews to work on the Sabbath and to travel on the Sabbath? Rabbi Akiva replied that he was aware that the governor was familiar with the Torah G\u2019d had given the Jews, so that he could ask him, why if two Jews share the same courtyard in front of their houses, what is the reason for the law whereby if each of the homeowners does not enter into an arrangement whereby he foregoes his legal claim to the courtyard, neither of them can move his chattels in that courtyard on the Sabbath, whereas when they each waive their claim, they can both use that courtyard freely? How come, he continued, that if a Jew has a palace owned exclusively by himself, and surrounded by a courtyard as large as the city of Damascus, he is free to move all his chattels all over that courtyard on the Sabbath? Similarly, the Lord Who owns both heaven and earth exclusively, is free to let the wind blow and to let the rain fall without thereby violating the laws of His Sabbath. He added, that if proof were needed for what he had told the Roman governor, let him reflect on the fact that that same Creator observed the Sabbath by not having given the Jews in the desert their heavenly bread, manna on that day, but giving them a double portion on the Sabbath eve, so that they would not go hungry on that day.

Rav Acha there adds that if we had always observed the Torah we would have also been physically free; no nation ever would have defeated us in war. As a reminder, even when reading the word as written, i.e. charut, we should think of it as having been vocalised cheyrut.\n", "6": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05e7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201che made the Children of Israel drink;\u201d on this verse Rashi observes that basically we are subject to death for certain sins by one of three types of death, a) as in the case where a woman has been suspected of infidelity by her husband, when there are no eyewitnesses to the supposed infidelity. In such cases death is brought about by Divine interference, the woman who had lied by protesting her innocence having to drink the \u201cbitter\u201d water, as a result of which she will die a painful death. [Compare Numbers 5,27) b) a capital offence was committed by a person who had been duly warned of the consequence of his deed by two legally qualified witnesses. The death penalty will be carried out by the guilty party being killed by the sword. Compare Deuteronomy 13,17, as explained by the Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin, folio 111. c) there are witnesses to the sin having been committed, but the sinner had not been warned immediately prior to committing the sin by qualified witnesses. In that case he will die by a plague at the instigation of G\u2019d. If Rashi were correct in comparing the death of the people worshipping the golden calf were executed by the sword as the people in Deuteronomy 13,17, why was their property not destroyed as is the case there? We would have to answer that they were punished as if they had been gentiles, where destruction of the sinner\u2019s property is not decreed.

When they do, we have to remind them that they do something similar every day, so how can they have the audacity to fault us for what happened one single time? Let us illustrate the scenario by a simple parable. A King had a beautiful wife; all his servant maids kept provoking her by saying that the day would come when he would divorce her and take one of them as a wife instead. When the queen asked them what prompted them to make such a statement, they said to her that they had observed the king when he came from the market he noticed that the queen\u2019s hand had some speck of dirt clinging to her hand, something that he could not stand.

He was immediately joined by all the members of the tribe of Levi. The entire male population of the tribe, none of whom had been counted, joined him. No other tribe, of those that had been numbered, was loyal in its entirety. This is reflected in Deuteronomy 33,9 (Moses\u2019 blessings of the people) where the Torah writes concerning the tribe of Levi: \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05db\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2---\u05db\u05d9 (\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) \u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05da, \u201cwho can say of his father and his mother: \u201cI have not seen him,\u201d (take part in the sin of the golden calf)  nor did he see his brother (do so) nor did his son have any knowledge (of that sin) for they all were loyal to Your word.\u201d Moses was not able to compliment any other tribe similarly. It appears that one reason for this great loyalty was the fact that Moses was their tribe\u2019s leader, and they did not wish to trade him for a leader from a different tribe. Maimonides, in his treatise on idolatry chapter 1, near the end, states that Avraham had already handed the Torah in oral form to his son Yitzchok, who transmitted it to Yaakov, who in turn transmitted it to his son Levi. The latter\u2019s sons already founded a Torah study academy, so that knowledge of the Torah\u2019s laws never was interrupted even during the many years of bondage in Egypt. It appears that the attitude to the golden calf by the different sections of the people was divided into three different groups; one group accepted the golden calf by promising to follow it to wherever it would lead the people, \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5; they only wished for the golden calf to be leader on their journeys. The second group accepted the golden calf as a symbol of idolatry; this group made up the three thousand Israelites who were killed by the Levites. The third group was the entire tribe of Levi which completely rejected the golden calf in all its aspects, remaining completely loyal to Hashem.", "11": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05ea\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4, \u201cso that he may bestow a blessing on you this day.\u201d From this day on the blessings that Moses bestowed on the Levites as described in Deuteronomy 33,8 additionally, although Yaakov had failed to bless them on his deathbed became effective, just as Moses blessed Reuven, although Yaakov had failed to bless him. He received a blessing from Moses although he did not receive it from his father Yaakov, as in the meantime his descendants had volunteered to be the vanguard of the army of the Israelites when they conquered the land of Canaan and they did not return to their families for 14 years until all the tribes had received their ancestral lands.", "12": "\u05de\u05d7\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0, \u201cplease erase me, etc.\u201d according to Rashi, when Moses used the expression \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05da, \u201cfrom Your book,\u201d he asked to have his name erased from the whole Torah. According to Rash\u2019bam, he only referred to the Book of Life in which people are inscribed on Rosh Hashanah if they will live out the year commencing on that day. (He bases himself on Isaiah 4,3, as well as on what Moses is recorded as having said in Numbers 11,15) This also appears to be the understanding of the Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah, folio 16. There the word: \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05da, \u201cfrom Your Book,\u201d is understood to refer to people who on that day have not yet qualified for a year of life until their merits exceed their demerits before the Day of Atonement, whereas the words: \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea, \u201cwhich You have written,\u201d is understood to refer to the righteous who have already been inscribed for another year of life. An alternate interpretation: Moses reminds G\u2019d that His reputation rests on the fact that He does not have favorites. If He will refuse to forgive the people their sin, how could He forgive Moses\u2019 sin since he had smashed His Tablets? G\u2019d explains to him that the comparison is not valid as the people who had committed the sin of the golden calf were the cause that made him smash the Tablets. He would punish those who had, without provocation, committed the sin, not Moses. Nonetheless, we find that Moses\u2019 name did not appear in the portion of Tetzaveh, the first time ever since he had been born. The reason is that the Rabbis have a rule that if a Torah scholar utters an oath, even a conditional oath, such as Yaakov decreeing death for the thief found with Lavan\u2019s teraphim, which had been stolen by his daughter Rachel, though not found in her possession, as was the condition of the oath, such an oath cannot be without consequences. Rachel\u2019s death before Yaakov crossing into the Holy Land is therefore attributed to this oath. Here too, Moses\u2019 oath could not remain without any consequences for him. G\u2019d therefore omitted mention of his name in that portion of the Torah."}, "30": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05da \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05da, \u201cand now, take off your ornaments!\u201d This command is difficult to understand as the Torah had already reported the people as having no longer put on their jewelry without having been ordered not to put it on. (Compare Exodus 33,4) Presumably, the people did not put their jewelry on for a day as a sign of mourning, but had put it on again on the following day. They had to be told therefore that at least as long as they had not atoned for their sin they were not allowed to wear ornaments. Rabbi Joseph Karo of blessed memory, explained verse four in our chapter, which reported the Israelites as not having put on their jewelry, as referring to the festive garments, the ones they had worn at the time the Ten Commandments had been revealed to them. This was the meaning of Exodus 19,14, where after immersing themselves in a ritual bath in preparation for that that event, they are described as putting on their garments. Had they been the same garments they had worn before immersing themselves in a ritual bath, the Torah certainly did not have to tell us that. They had had their jewelry removed from them by angels sent for that purpose to make them conscious of their great sin, as reported in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 88. This is also the meaning of Exodus 33,6: \u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05e0\u05e6\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201cthey stripped themselves; An alternate explanation: the meaning of the words in verse 4: \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5', is that they took off their uniforms, as if saying that unless G\u2019d will march with us we will not agree to fight for possession of the land of Canaan.

He based this on Isaiah 35,10. This is also why we read after Moses\u2019 return from the Mountain that his face was shining so brilliantly that the people were blinded until he covered his forehead with a kind of veil. (Exodus 34,9) An alternate interpretation: the word \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc  here is closely related to \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8, light, where we find the word \u05d1\u05d4\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e0\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9, \u201cwhen His lamp shone over my head;\u201d (Job 29.3)\n", "2": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9, \u201cand You have not informed me;\u201d Moses means that not only did G\u2019d not inform me of details about the angel which He had said that He would send to walk ahead of the Jewish people (Exodus 32, 34) ; it is not only that You Yourself will not walk in front of us, but You did not even name the angel You have assigned for this task. We are now no better off than any human being on earth, each one of whom has an angel walking in front of him. (Compare Psalms 91,11) where David refers to this with the words: \u05db\u05d9 \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05da \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8 \u05dc\u05da \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9\u05da, \u201cfor He will order His angels to guard you wherever you go.\u201d Seeing that this is so, how do I benefit from Your having told me that I have found favour in Your eyes?

Furthermore, why did Moses say afterwards in verse 16: \u201chow can I know that both I and Your people have found favour in Your eyes, except by the fact that You will walk with us and we will be distinguished vis a vis any other nation?\u201d G\u2019d had already agreed to do what Moses had asked of Him! We may have to understand the whole dialogue between G\u2019d and Moses as follows: G\u2019d\u2019s words: \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05da, \u201cand I will give you rest,\u201d at the end of verse 14 are addressed to Moses personally, but are not a promise to the people. G\u2019d did not promise that the people can feel at \u201crest,\u201d i.e. reassured so that they would not have to worry about their future. They will not be able to experience the glory of My presence. When Moses heard this, he continued that unless the people can see that You have agreed to personally lead us as You have done in the past, even I do not know that I have found favour in your eyes. At that point G\u2019d responded that He would walk with the people as before the episode of the golden calf. An alternate interpretation: after the words: \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5, \u201cI will personally go (with you),\u201c Moses understood that G\u2019d\u2019s anger had ceased, and that He now related to the people as He had done when He had said: (Leviticus 17,10) \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 , \u201cI\u2019ll set My face against him.\u201d (At that time individual wrongdoing had been the subject.) Once My anger has receded from that level, G\u2019d meant, I will give you rest, but not immediately. Upon hearing this, Moses continued pleading saying that this was not good enough for him until the relationship between G\u2019d and Moses as well as the people had been completely restored. G\u2019d\u2019s response to Moses\u2019 \u201cultimatum\u201d which had been accompanied by Moses refusing to move from that place any further, was: \u201c| have decided to go along with your conditions.\u201d", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9, (returning to verse 12) \u201cand You have not informed me, etc.\u201d first G\u2019d had told Moses that henceforth He would send an angel ahead of the people on their journeys who would expel the Canaanites from their country (compare verse 2 in our chapter). A few verses later (verse 5) Moses had been told to divest the people of their jewelry. Even at that stage G\u2019d had not yet revealed if He, personally, would again walk ahead of the people on their journey through the desert, even though they already had taken off their jewelry at His command. When You said to me: \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05da \u05d1\u05e9\u05dd, \u201cI know you by name,\u201d (verse 12) I assumed that You would tell me the name of the angel, i.e. his specific attribute, Moses, at that stage had still been afraid to demand from G\u2019d that He walk with him and the people personally, as G\u2019d had warned that if Ed.] He were to do so any infractions would result in the people being consumed by His wrath (\u05e4\u05df \u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05da \u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05da, verse 3 in our chapter). This is also why he phrased verse 13 with the reference to \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9\u05da, \u201cYour ways.\u201d The reason he referred to \u201cYour ways\u201d in the plural, was that he did not know which of G\u2019d\u2019s ways (attributes) would be most advantageous for the Israelites. He therefore resolved to ask G\u2019d to reveal all His attributes to Him so that he would know what the situation that the Jewish people found themselves in needed to be appealed to. Thereupon G\u2019d responded by saying: \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5, \u201cI, personally will go,\u201d as this will be most beneficial for you. This is very similar to what we read in Samuel II 17,11: \u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05da \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1, \u201cand that you yourself will march into battle. [Chushai advised Absalom that in his revolt against his father David, he should march at the head of his troops.

You will now be able to make an intelligent choice. Nonetheless, Moses was still afraid of the possibility that G\u2019d would suddenly annihilate the people if they would anger Him once more. At any rate, he now knew that the word \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 G\u2019d had used was meant in its beneficial sense of the word. He realised beyond any doubt that G\u2019d\u2019s personal presence among the Israelites was a great compliment for the people. When Moses realised that this was a time when G\u2019d was very well disposed toward him, he decided to pursue requesting still more details about G\u2019d\u2019s attributes and what each stood for. He went as far as requesting a visual revelation of G\u2019d\u2019s essence.

This is how the Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah folio 17 interprets this proclamation. We need to delve more deeply into this subject. Since when had man been in need of this attribute of the Lord before he had sinned? We are forced to answer that seeing the Lord is aware of what goes on in the innermost regions of our heart, He was aware that we would commit sins even before we had converted sinful thoughts into sinful deeds. This is why both of these \u201cnames\u201d of the Lord are actually two separate attributes of the thirteen attributes revealed to Moses at this point. On the other hand, the attribute known as \u05e0\u05d5\u05e6\u05e8 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cstoring up kindness for up to two thousand generations,\u201d which apparently are two separate attributes are in reality only a single attribute.

He therefore repeated here that these men had not been chosen by him but by G\u2019d, personally. In fact, Moses, personally, had originally thought that he himself had been charged with the whole task, seeing that G\u2019d had said to him: \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea , \u201cyou will make,\u201d etc., chapter 25,17, and subsequently. The plural impersonal mode had been reserved for the construction of the Holy Ark (Exodus 25,10). G\u2019d explained to him then already that on the contrary, not as he had thought, he would not build the Tabernacle but a descendant of Chur, who had given his life trying to stop the Jewish people from making a golden calf would be charged with that task. By doing so he would help atone for the murder of his grandfather and for the sin of the golden calf.

The Holy Ark was not to be left outside for even an hour."}, "34": ["\u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9 \u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df, \u201cBetzalel constructed the Ark.\u201d It was the first of the furnishings of the Tabernacle. This corresponds to what we read in Psalms 119,130: and \u05e4\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05da \u05d9\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8 \u05de\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u201ceven the preamble to the words You inscribed give light.\u201d David referred to the \u201clight\u201d G\u2019d had created on the first day prior to proceeding to creating the three dimensional universe. This is what the Holy Ark represented in the Tabernacle as the Torah it contained has been defined by Solomon in Proverbs 6,23 as: \u05db\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e8 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d5\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cfor the individual commandment is a lamp, whereas the Torah as a whole represents light itself.\u201d The reason why you do not find Betzalel\u2019s name associated with any of the furnishings of the Tabernacle other than the Holy Ark, is that in connection with that item Betzalel had demonstrated the degree of holy spirit which G\u2019d had endowed him with. Moses had suggested to Betzalel to construct the Holy Ark as the first item to be made for the Tabernacle, whereupon Betzalel upon hearing this questioned it by saying to him: \u201care you sure? Does one not build a house before making the furniture for it?\u201d Moses then remembered that he had forgotten the order in which G\u2019d had told him to proceed. Our sages kept this story alive by pointing out that the meaning of Betzalel\u2019s name \u05d1\u05e6\u05dc-\u05d0\u05dc is: \u201din the shadow of G\u2019d,\u201d i.e. he must have been nearby when G\u2019d instructed Moses.

This was next to the washbasin for the priests from which they washed their hands and feet, and from the waters contained therein that a woman suspected of infidelity, Sotah would be made to drink in order to prove that she was innocent of that sin.", "1": {"0": " \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05df, \u201cthese are the records of the Tabernacle, etc.;\u201d", "1": "\u05d4\u05e2\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cthe testimony;\u201d The Tabernacle served as testimony to the gentile nations that Hashem had forgiven His people for the sin of the golden calf. It proved that His glory resided amongst them again. An alternate interpretation: the word \u05e2\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea, serves as testimony on behalf of Moses that at the time when the people suspected him of having stolen from the shekalim which had served Moses at the census, Moses had asked that once the Tabernacle would be complete its existence should serve as testimony that he had not taken a single piece of silver for himself. The people examined the amounts of silver used in the construction of the Tabernacle and found that the silver they thought had disappeared had actually been used in making the hooks for the hangings around the Tabernacle\u2019s courtyard. This is hinted at in the text of the Torah in Exodus 36,7, where the respective first letters in the line: \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d3\u05d9\u05dd , \u201cthe raw material they had was sufficient,\u201d have a numerical value of 15, i.e. there had been 15 hooks in those hangings which had been constructed from the \u201cexcess\u201d silver not used up for making the sockets of the boards and the entrance pillars.

This had not been spelled when the Torah told us what the gold was used for, as no complete item other than the menorah, candlestick, was made of gold. Gold was used as an overlay both for the altar, the Holy Ark, the Table and the boards of the walls. It is worthwhile to reflect on how important the Tabernacle was relative to the creation of the physical universe, and how this was reflected in many of the details surrounding it, On the first day G\u2019d was reported as having created heaven and earth before giving the order to light to come into existence. [Heaven and earth you will recall were wrapped completely in darkness. Ed.] G\u2019d\u2019s activity on that day is described in Psalms 104,2 as \u05e0\u05d5\u05d8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4, \u201cspreading the heavens like a carpet.\u201d The corresponding activity when constructing the Tabernacle was covering its walls with goat-skins. (Exodus 26,7) On the second day G\u2019d had created the horizon and divided the lower waters from the upper waters. (Genesis 1,6) The corresponding activity involving the construction of the Tabernacle was the installation of the dividing curtain, \u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05ea, between the Holy of Holies, and the Sanctuary proper. (Exodus 26,33) On the third day G\u2019d had commanded the earth beneath the oceans to form a coherent surface and to become visible above the waters of the ocean. (Genesis 1,9) The corresponding activity during the construction of the Tabernacle was the making of the water-basin, \u05db\u05d9\u05d5\u05e8 used by the priests to purify their hands and feet. (Exodus 30,18) On the fourth day G\u2019d had positioned the Luminaries in the sky, (Genesis 1,14). The corresponding activity had been the making and placing of the menorah in the Tabernacle and kindling it. (Exodus 25,31) On the fifth day G\u2019d had created the fish and the birds (Genesis 1,20), and the corresponding activity during the construction of the Tabernacle had been the winged cherubs which had been constructed and placed on the cover of the Holy Ark. (Exodus 25,6) On the sixth day G\u2019d had created the first human being, (Genesis 1,27); the corresponding activity during construction of the Tabernacle was the order to Moses to consecrate his brother Aaron as High Priest. (Exodus 28,1.) On the seventh day, G\u2019d had \u201crested,\u201d (Genesis 2,1) the corresponding report concerning the Tabernacle is found in Exodus 39,43, with the words: \u05d5\u05ea\u05db\u05dc \u05db\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05df, \u201call the work of constructing the Tabernacle had been completed\u201d After G\u2019d had completed to create the universe He blessed it and all its inhabitant and he sanctified the Sabbath  (Genesis 2,1) Moses did likewise in Numbers 7,1. The Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle reminds us of the heavens, source of our spiritual inspiration, whereas the table is symbolic of earth and its products is reminding us of how the Creator has provided for all His creatures. The showbreads are the visible symbol on that Table. The six rows on which they were placed are reminiscent of the six seasons of the year: sowing, harvesting, cold season, hot season, summer and winter."}}}
