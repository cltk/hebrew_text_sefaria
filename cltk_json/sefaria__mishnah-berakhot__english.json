From the time when the <i>Kohanim</i> go in to eat their <i>Terumah</i> [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], until the end of the first watch \u2013 so says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn.  It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel\u2019s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited <i>Shema</i>. He said to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it.  And [this is true] not only in this case; rather, in all cases where the Sages said that [some precept can be performed only] until midnight \u2014 their precepts are [still in force] until the break of dawn. [For example:] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] \u2014 their precepts [can be performed] until the break of dawn. And [another example:] all [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day \u2014 their precepts [of eating them can be performed] until the break of dawn.  If that is so, why did the Sages say, \"until midnight\"? To distance a person from transgression.", "1": "From when may one recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning? From when one can distinguish between <i>Tekhelet</i> [purple-blue wool] and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: [The earliest time for <i>Shema</i> is when one can distinguish] between <i>Tekhelet</i> and the color of leek, and one must finish reciting it by sunrise. Rabbi Yehoshua says: [One may recite <i>Shema</i>] until three hours [of the day], for such is the way of the sons of kings, to arise at the third hour. If one recites [<i>Shema</i>] later than this, he has not lost out, [but rather is] like one who reads the Torah.", "2": "The school of Shammai says: In the evening all people should recline and recite [<i>Shema</i>], and in the morning they should stand, since it says [in the verse (Deut. 6:7)], \u201cAnd when you lie down and when you arise.\u201d But the school of Hillel says: Each person may recite it in his usual way (posture), since it says (ibid.), \u201cAnd when you walk on the road.\u201d If so, why does it say \u201cand when you lie down and when you arise\u201d? \u2014[It means:] at the time when people are lying down, and at the time when people are arising. Said Rabbi Tarfon: \u201cI was once traveling on the road, and I reclined to recite [<i>Shema</i>] in accordance with the view of the school of Shammai, and [by doing so] I put myself in danger of [attack by] bandits.\u201d They [the other Sages] said to him: \u201cYou would have deserved to be guilty for your own fate, since you went against the view of the school of Hillel.\u201d", "3": "In the morning one says two blessings before it [<i>Shema</i>] and one after it, while in the evening one says two blessings before it and two after it, a long one and a short one.

Rabbi Yehuda says: Between <i>Vayomer</i> and <i>Emet veyatsiv</i> -- one may not pause. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karchah said: Why does <i>Shema</i> precede <i>Vehayah im shamoa</i>? So that one may accept the yoke of the kingdom of heaven first, and after that accept the yoke of the commandments. And [why does] <i>Vehayah im shamoa</i> [precede] <i>Vayomer</i>?
