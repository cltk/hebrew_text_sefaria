Gamliel, who says (1:5): \"Chullin is eaten all four hours, and terumah, all five.\" The halachah, however, is not in accordance with him, but both terumah and chullin are eaten all four, \"suspended\" all of the fifth, and burned at the beginning of the sixth.] (\"he feeds it to beasts, animals, and birds\":) [It is necessary to state all. For if only \"beasts\" were stated, we would assume that with a beast, where what is left over can be seen and burned, it is permitted; but with an animal, such as a marten, a cat, and a weasel, where what is left over is generally hidden, it is forbidden. (We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise.) And if only \"animals\" were stated, we would assume that it is permitted because an animal hides what it leaves over, so that the owner is not in transgression of \"bal yeraeh\" (\"It may not be seen\"); but if a beast leaves something over, the owner might not remember to burn it and he would be in transgression of \"bal yeraeh,\" so that I might think it were forbidden. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise. And since we are taught \"beasts\" and \"animals,\" we are also taught \"birds.\"] And he may sell it to a gentile, [as opposed to the view of Beth Shammai, who say that one is forbidden to sell his chametz to a gentile unless he knows that he will finish it before Pesach, an Israelite being commanded to remove it from the world and (to see to it) that it not remain.], and it is permitted to derive benefit from it [i.e., from its ashes. If he burned it before the time that it is forbidden, he is permitted to derive benefit from its ashes even after the time that it is forbidden.] Once its time has passed, [i.e., when the sixth hour has arrived, even though it is only rabbinically interdicted], it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, [just as if derivation of benefit were prohibited by the Torah. So that if he betrothed a woman with it, we do not grant validity to his betrothal. And even hardened chametz, such as grain on which (roof-) drippings have fallen, which even on Pesach itself is only rabbinically interdicted \u2014 if he betrothed a woman with it on the fourteenth (of Nissan) when the sixth hour had arrived, we grant no validity to his betrothal.], and he may not kindle oven or stove with it. [This must be stated vis-\u00e0-vis R. Yehudah, who says that there is no removal of chametz but burning. We might think that while burning it one could derive benefit from it. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise, that even in the (regular) course of its removal it is forbidden to derive benefit from it once the time of its prohibition has arrived.] R. Yehudah says: There is no removal of chametz but burning [He derives it from \"nothar\" (left-over sacrificial portions), from which benefit may not be derived, which is punishable by kareth, like chametz, and which is commanded to be burned, and not (to be disposed of) in any other manner.]; and the sages say: It is also permitted to scatter it to the winds or cast it into the sea. [The rabbis do not derive it from nothar, for this (derivation) is controverted by (the law of) a stoned ox, which though forbidden for eating and derivation of benefit, and punishable by kareth, does not require burning.]", "1": "\tIt is permitted to derive benefit from the chametz of a gentile over which Pesach has passed. [This is not to say that it is forbidden to eat it \u2014 but since it is to be taught: \"and it is forbidden to derive benefit from that of an  Israelite,\" the antithesis is stated in respect to a gentile. Or else, because there are some who forbid to themselves the bread of a gentile, it is not stated explicitly: \"It is permitted to eat the chametz of a gentile.\"]; and it is forbidden to derive benefit from that of an Israelite, it being written (Exodus 13:7): \"Se'or (leaven) shall not be seen unto you.\" [That is, he is penalized for having transgressed \"Se'or shall not be seen unto you.\" Or else, this refers to the beginning, viz.: \"The chametz of a gentile is permitted,\" it being written: \"Se'or shall not be seen unto you,\" which is expounded: What is yours, you may not see, but you may see what is a gentile's.]", "2": "\tIf a gentile lent an Israelite [money] on his (the Israelite's) chametz [before Pesach, and the Israelite said to him: \"If I have not repaid you by this and this date, acquire it from now,\" and he left the pledge in the gentile's home, where it remained all of Pesach], after Pesach, he may derive benefit from it. [For since the time arrived and he did not pay him, the chametz, being in the gentile's domain, did not lack \"claiming,\" so that it is seen retroactively that at the time he pledged it with him, it was his (the gentile's)]. And if an Israelite lent a gentile on his (the gentile's) chametz \u2014 after Pesach, he may not derive benefit from it. [For it is seen retroactively that it was the Israelite's.] If debris falls upon chametz, it is considered removed, [notwithstanding which he must nullify it, lest the mound be removed on the festival and he be found to have transgressed.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Whatever a dog cannot search after (is considered removed). [How much can a dog search after?

For in respect to one who eats terumah unwittingly it is written (Leviticus 22:14): \"And he shall give to the Cohein the holy thing\" \u2014 something which can become holy \u2014 not money, but fruit. And what is paid becomes terumah, so that it is not the monetary worth that is being paid.] (If he eats it) wittingly, [If he were witting in respect to the terumah, even if he were unwitting in respect to the chametz], he is exempt from payment and from the worth of the wood. [If it were unclean terumah, he does not pay the worth of the wood, which can be used as fuel for cooking. For if he were witting in respect to the terumah, he is like any other robber, and he pays money, relative to worth and not relative to amount.
