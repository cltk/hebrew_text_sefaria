We place them on the head and tie it on the arm, even if one crown of one letter of the four section are not properly written, the Torah says that they are prevented from being fit, until they are written completely as they have been established...", "1": "2.

Tefillin have ten details that are all halachah according to Moses from Sinai, and all of them prevents tefillin from being it, therefore if one changes one of them those are unfit tefillin. Two of these are with regards to their writing, and eight of them are regarding the covering and the tying of the straps. These are the two regarding their writing: They must be written in ink, and they must be written on parchment", "3": "Tefillin and Mezuzot cannot be written except for in Assyrian script. And for Torah scrolls, they allowed it to be written also in Greek, but this Greek language has already disappeared from the world and been lost, so today all three may only be written in Assyrian script. And he must be careful in their writing that two letters not stick together, for any letter that is not surrounded by parchment on all four sides is disqualified. And any letter that a child who is not wise, nor a fool, cannot read is disqualified. Therefore, he must be careful with forming the letters that a yud not look like a vav, nor a vav a yud, nor a kaf a bet, nor a bet a kaf, nor a dalet a reish, nor a reish a dalet, and the like, until the reader will not have trouble."}, "1": {"0": "...One who said the blessing \"to lay on Tefillin\" and tied on the Tefillin of the hand, it is forbidden for him to talk, and even to return greetings to his teacher, until he places on that of the head. And if he spoke, this is a sin, and he must say a second blessing, \"concerning the precept of Tefillin,\" and the he places on that of the head.", "1": "--"}, "2": {"0": "How is the Mezuzah written? One writes two paragraphs, Shema and Vehaya Im Shamoah on one page, on one sheet, and with space below it and above, equal to the width of half a fingernail. And if he wrote it on two or three pages it is Kosher, so long as he did not shape the text like a tail [wide at the top and narrow at the bottom -- triangular] or circular, or like a tent [triangle wide at the bottom and narrow at the top], and if he did it one of those ways it is invalid. If he wrote it in the wrong order, such as a section before a section [that should precede it] it is invalid. If he wrote it on two skins even if he stitched them together it is invalid. A Mezuzah may not be written on a worn out Torah Scroll or on worn out tefillin because one does not go down from a grave holiness to a mild holiness.", "1": "The simple practice is that we write on the *mezuza* on the outside, opposite the space between one paragraph and another, \"*Shaddai*.\" And there is no loss from this, since it is on the outside. However, those who write on the inside the names of the angels, holy names, a verse, or signatures, these are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these simpletons, it is not enough for them that they invalidated the commandment, but they treated a great commadment - the unifications of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, with His love, and His service - as if it is an amulet for their own benefit, as it arose on their hearts the foolish idea that this is something that will provide benefit with respect to the vanities of the world.", "2": "Everybody is obligated in the Mitzvah of Mezuzah, even women and slaves. We educate minors to perform the Mitzvah of Mezuzah for their houses. One who rents a house outside the Land, and one who dwells in an inn in the Land of Israel, is exempt from putting up a Mezuzah for 30 days. But one who rents a house in the Land of Israel is obligated to put up a Mezuzah immediately."}, "3": {"0": "A toilet, a bath house, a mikveh, and a tannery and those like them, are exempt from a mezuzah because they are not used as a dignified dwelling.  A sukkah on Sukkot and a house on a boat are exempt from having a mezuzah because they are not used as fixed dwellings.  Two booths of potters, one inside the other, the outer one is exempt from the mezuzah because it is not fixed.  Stores in the market are exempt because they are not fixed as dwellings.", "1": "People must be very careful about the mitzvah of mezzzah because it is an obligation on everyone at all times, so that any time they go out or come in, they will brush against the unity of the name of the Holy Blessed One and remember God's love and wake up from their sleep and errors in the futilities of daily life and know that there is nothing that lasts forever except the knowledge of the Rock of Ages. And they will then immediately return to their true knowledge and and walk on the right path. The sages said: anyone who has tefillin on their head and arm, and tzitzit on their clothing, and a mezuzah on their doorpost is safe from sin, for they have so many reminders, and they are the angels that save people from sin, as it is written, \"The angel of the LORD camps around those who fear God and rescues them.\" (Ps 34:7)"}, "4": {"0": "It is a positive commandment on every Jewish man to write a Torah scroll for himself as it says \"Write for yourself this song\", that is to say 'Write for yourself a Torah which has in it this song', because one does not write the Torah only in segments.  Even if one's ancestors left him a Torah scroll, it is a mitzvah to write one for himself.  If he wrote it by his own hand, it is as if he received it from Mount Sinai, and if he doesn't know  how to write, others can write it for him.  One who corrects a Torah scroll, even a single letter, it is as if he wrote all of it.", "1": "It is a positive commandment for the king to write an additional Torah scroll for himself as king, besides the one he had as a normal person, as it says, \"When he is sitting upon his throne, he shall write...\"  He corrects it based on the scroll from the Temple Courtyard, according to the Sanhedrin.  The one he wrote as a normal person he should place in storage, and the one he wrote or which was written for him as king should be with him always.  If he goes off to war, the scroll should go with him.

", "3": "A Torah scroll written without engraved lines, or written partially on whole skins and partially on parchment is unfit.  Either it should be entirely whole skins or entirely parchment.  How does one write a Torah scroll?  He writes an exceedingly correct and pleasant writing.  Between each word he leaves a space like a small letter, and between each letter a space like a hair, and between each line a space like a line.  Each line should be [at least] 30 letters long so one could write \"l'mishpchoteichem\" [which has 10 letters in Hebrew]3 times, and this is the width of each column.  No line should be narrower than than this, lest it appear like a letter, and no line should be longer lest the reader lose his place.    ..."}, "5": "Any impure person, even [a woman in] a niddah state or a gentile, may hold a Torah scroll and read it. The words of Torah do not contract ritual impurity. This applies when one's hands are not soiled or dirty with mud. [In the latter instance,] one should wash one's hands and then touch the scroll."}}
