Examples of the latter kind of communication occur in Genesis 18,2 as well as in Genesis 19,1 and in Numbers 22,31.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e1\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e9, it kept burning; This phenomenon indicated the prophetic nature of the experience. Unless the angel had been within the bush, this could not have happened as something natural. The fire Moses saw burning enveloped the angel. The implied message was that the righteous members of the Jewish people, who are themselves angels of G\u2019d, i.e. His messengers on earth, and who are surrounded by the Egyptian nation who treated them as burning thistles or less, would themselves become subject to this fire when enduring the ten plagues, but would remain unharmed by all those plagues. This is what Moses was taught when he saw \u05d5\u05d4\u05e1\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5\u05db\u05dc. it was not consumed by the flames which kept burning. The level of Moses\u2019 prophecy at that time was not yet at the level it would be later on. The very fact that the Torah describes Moses as being even afraid to look at the spectacle before his eyes is proof of this (compare verse 6). From the day the Torah was given, as the Torah testifies in Numbers 12,8 \u05d5\u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4' \u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8, G\u2019d extended the power of Moses\u2019 prophetic visions so that He shows him a visual image of G\u2019d. The entire Jewish people had had a brief revelation of G\u2019d\u2019s glory at Mont Sinai only. Their power of endurance was so limited even at that time that the Torah reports them as saying that they could not even endure hearing the voice of the Lord, not to speak of enduring a visual image. Only Moses was able to retain the level of prophecy which the entire nation experienced during the revelation at Mount Sinai.

He hoped that by demonstrating His greatness and His power this would eventually cause the Egyptians to recognise all this. At the same time, G\u2019d also spelled out a similar thought in 9,16 but aimed at the Israelites, when He said: \u201cthat the only reason He had not yet killed Pharaoh was so that in the course of more plagues you, the Jewish people, would come to recognise both G\u2019d\u2019s greatness and His patience.\u201c He also wanted the Jewish people to learn how to both love and revere Him when they witnessed and thought about the meaning of all these plagues. There can be no question that without G\u2019d stiffening Pharaoh\u2019s attitude from time to time, he would have collapsed much sooner and would have sent the Israelites on their desired journey. However, this would not have been the result of his repentance and humbling himself before the Lord, involving genuine regret about his previous errors, but the result of his impotence to withstand the pressure applied to him. He would have acted out of terror of what the next plague would do to him and to his country. If we needed confirmation of this, all we have to do is look at what his servants said to him when Moses threatened with the plague of locust. They said to him: \u201chow long will you be obstinate, do you not see that Egypt will go down the drain?!\u201d There was not a single word of regret of past errors, no word of recognition that G\u2019d could have killed them all long before this and that He must therefore be very patient, and kind, but mere terror forced them to utter these words. (10,7) Keeping all this in mind, it is foolish to ask how G\u2019d could punish Pharaoh after he Himself had interfered with his decision-making process by \u201cstiffening his heart,\u201d \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e7\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d1 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4, I will stiffen the heart of Pharaoh, etc.\u201d not in order to punish him but in order to finally trigger repentance in his heart. The operative clause is \u201cin order that I can demonstrate all these miracles of Mine in his midst\u201d (10,1), the purpose being to bring about his humbling himself in repentance and genuine contrition. If that wish of G\u2019d would indeed materialise, the Jewish people also would tell of G\u2019d\u2019s greatness, (\u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05df \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05d9, having observed at first hand how the mightiest secular power on earth turned into G\u2019d fearing human beings.) They would tell their children and children\u2019s children the lesson they had learned that G\u2019d\u2019s apparent cruelty is actually an act of loving kindness as it results in His creatures coming to love and to revere Him. [Noach, who had survived the destruction of mankind by a deliberate act of G\u2019d\u2019s kindness to him and his family, had not been able to relate to his children what G\u2019d hoped that the Israelites would be able to relate to their children. Ed.] The basic lesson in ethics we derive from all this is that when suffering an affliction we must first and foremost examine our past actions to find out where we went wrong, and try to find out what these afflictions are intended to trigger in our memory so that we can improve our conduct both vis-\u00e0-vis G\u2019d and our fellow man.", "1": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e2 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4; not before the plague materialises after the warning, nor even after the plague did come to pass. He will not listen to you even after having endured many such plagues. Seeing that this is so, I will be forced to bring retribution upon them. This retribution will take the form of the killing of the firstborn as well as the drowning of all the military might of Egypt in the sea.

The implication was that betraying G\u2019d\u2019s trust would have painful consequences. The entire experience is a reminder of the manner in which the Rabbis relate to a potential convert to Judaism. One does not present Judaism in rosy attractive colours so as to encourage him to convert, but on the contrary, one apprises him first and foremost of the \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cthe yoke of the commandments,\u201d telling him of all the things he would have to forego by joining the Jewish people, i.e. the Jewish religion. Moreover, one advises him that whereas up until now he was able to eat certain foods, such as chelev, not only would he no longer be able to eat these foods, but violation of the commandment would carry the penalty of karet, loss of entitlement to his afterlife, etc. Only after he has duly absorbed this information does one proceed with teaching him the intricacies of Judaism. What happened at Marah was preparatory to accepting Judaism at Mount Sinai. If the people had not gone through this process it is doubtful that they would have said \u05e0\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05e2, \u201cwe will do, now let us learn G\u2019d\u2019s Torah,\u201d when the time came for this a few weeks later.", "1": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d0\u05da, the point of all this is that once you have accepted the statutes and then fail to honour your commitment you will be subject to punishment by G\u2019d. These punishments will be in the nature of being self-inflicted as all of G\u2019d\u2019s commandments are designed to make your life on earth and beyond a healthy life. Failure to honour your commitment will expose you to all the negative influences which abound on earth. I have shown you that I can cure harmful waters, waters which humans cannot drink. This is only a sample of what My commandments and observing them can do for you. We, today, do not know what kind of wood or tree G\u2019d told Moses to throw into these waters. The Torah deliberately did not reveal this information. Even if all the trees in the world would be the kind that G\u2019d told Moses to throw into the water, and even if we would throw all this wood into only a minute quantity of water the result would be nil. On the other hand, if, by the grace of G\u2019d, one throws even a minute quantity of such wood into even an entire ocean, the waters of the ocean would suddenly become drinking water. [my addition. Ed.] Leviticus 20,26 states clearly that G\u2019d separates the Jewish people from the surrounding nations.

The same thought is expressed in Psalms 44,6 \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05da \u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05e1 \u05e7\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cwith the help of Your name we will vanquish those who rise up against us.\u201d"}, "9": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05e1 \u05d9-\u05d4, Moses explains the reason and purpose of his prayer being the fact that G\u2019d Himself had sworn an oath to remain at war with Amalek from generation to generation. If G\u2019d is at war with that nation, we as G\u2019d\u2019s representative on earth, must certainly also be at war with that nation. It is what our sages referred to when they said that three commandments cannot be fulfilled until the Jewish people are securely settled in the land of Israel, 1) appointment of a king; 2) destroying the last vestiges of Amalek; 3) the building of a permanent Temple. Moses therefore had prayed for the time when these three hallmarks of Jewish history could be attained.

When one hears of something which is just happening, the Torah uses the term \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cseeing,\u201d i.e. first hand knowledge of something. It does not matter whether the sound of the happening comes from a distant location or is nearby within one\u2019s eyesight. Examples of the use of the word \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4 \u201cseeing\u201d being used for matters which were heard second hand, not seen, are found in Genesis 42,1 where Yaakov, resident in the land of Canaan, is reported as \u201cseeing\u201d that there was grain for sale in Egypt. Clearly, the Torah refers to Yaakov having heard about it. Seeing the matter was not near at hand nor had occurred just then, the Torah used the words \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, \u201cJacob saw.\u201d A similar use of the word \u201cseeing,\u201d \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 for something not actually seen is Numbers 22,2 where Bileam is reported as \u201cseeing\u201d all that Israel had done to the Emorite kings. Bileam had not seen any of it, but had heard that the Israelites had defeated the two most powerful Emorite kings Sichon and Og. A third example confirming our theory would be Deuteronomy 28,10 where the people of the globe are reported as expressing their conviction that the Jewish people are G\u2019d\u2019s darlings and that they would therefore be in awe of them. Clearly, the people of the globe could not have \u201cseen\u201d this, but they had heard about the success of the Jewish nation. The events inspiring such feelings among the nations of the globe had occurred over a period of time, not all at once. However, if we understand the words \u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 as meaning \u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0, \u201cwhen He took out,\u201d we must understand Yitro as saying that he had heard all that G\u2019d had done for Israel at the time when He took them out of Egypt. This would include a reference to all the plagues, the drowning of the Egyptians army, etc. It was this information which had prompted him to journey into the desert himself instead of sending a messenger who would accompany Tzipporah and her children so that they would be reunited with their husband/father. He was primarily motivated by his quest for G\u2019d. This is similar to Chronicles II 32,31 where the king of Babylon wanted to have evidence of the reports he had received about the miraculous recovery from his illness which King Chizkiyah had experienced.", "1": "\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4.

Moses had informed her that the Israelites would not stop anywhere for any length of time until they would reach the mountain of G\u2019d, Mount Chorev, where they would serve the Lord. She must have known about this as Moses must have told her of G\u2019d\u2019s prediction in Exodus 3,12 that once out of Egypt the Jewish people would serve the Lord there at that mountain. This is the reason why it took Yitro so long before he came as he had to wait until the Jewish people would make camp for longer than one night.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05d7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4. At the time Eliezer was born the old king who had wanted to execute Moses had already been dead for a while. This is one of the reasons why the Torah mentioned this death in Exodus 2,23. At that time Moses felt secure from further attempts on his life. Pharaoh\u2019s international police had an exceedingly long reach, just as that of Achav, King of Israel, who had been hunting for the prophet Elijah all over the neighbouring countries of Israel as documented in Kings I 18,10 \u201cis there any kingdom to which the king (Achav) has not sent emissaries to arrange to have to you captured?\u201d", "3": "\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05e0\u05da \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5, Yitro sent this message as a matter of courtesy so that Moses would not be taken unawares by his sudden arrival.

(Esther 2,20 \u201cEsther continued to carry out Mordechai\u2019s instructions as she had done when she lived under his roof.\u201d) Joseph also did not use his exalted position to look down on his brothers.

In Psalms 78,49 the psalmist describes 4, resp. 5 stages of G\u2019d\u2019s anger which the Egyptians had to experience before they died. Tthat verse is the subject of detailed analysis in the Haggadah shel Pessach.

The Egyptians died by drowning just as their victims the Jewish babies had died by drowning. Yitro recognised that the ability to make the punishment fit the crime is what put our G\u2019d in a class all by Himself, unparalleled in any other religion.

(compare Deut.5,4 concerning the expression \u201cface to face.\u201d) One of the principal ingredients of this level of prophecy is that the prophet remains in full control of all his faculties including all parts of his body, something no one had been able to credit until they saw that Moses possessed such a capability.The Israelites commented on this in Deuteronomy 5,21 when Moses quoted them as having said: \u201cthis day we have seen that G\u2019d can speak directly to man and man can survive such an encounter.\u201d [In other words, it took the revelation at Mount Sinai, experienced by all the people, to teach them that Moses could enjoy such a relationship with G\u2019d on an ongoing basis. Ed.] It is not that the people needed convincing that there were people who enjoyed prophetic stature and communicated with G\u2019d and He with them. After all, they knew about all the patriarchs, Aaron and Miriam as well as Moses being prophets. However, up until this time all prophetic messages from G\u2019d had been communicated either in a dream or in a vision involving the prophet losing touch with his surroundings at the time of such communication by G\u2019d.

[Avraham\u2019s being able to run to welcome the angels, (his vision) was a sign of a higher than usual level of prophecy. Ed.] Now, for the first time, did the people witness that the recipient of such communications need not necessarily have to temporarily forego being in touch with all that goes on in our terrestrial world. You will understand this better in light of how G\u2019d Himself explained to Miriam and Aaron in Numbers 12,7 the difference between their level of communication with G\u2019d and that of their brother Moses, whom G\u2019d described as thoroughly \u201cat home\u201d in all sections of \u201cHis house.\u201d Only after having themselves experienced what this kind of prophetic level meant could they credit Moses as possessing it.

He conveyed the people\u2019s words to G\u2019d to show that they had unreservedly undertaken to accept everything G\u2019d wanted from them as conveyed to them from him as G\u2019d\u2019s word.

We know already from Exodus 23,21 that an angel is not empowered to forgive any errors committed by the people, \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d0 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e9\u05e2\u05db\u05dd, and therefore Moses himself rejected the idea that the people be under the protection of an angel instead of under G\u2019d\u2019s personal supervision.

Moses was not forbidden physical contact with his own wife until he had attained this level of prophetic stature. This would commence from the time of the revelation and onwards. At that time he released the other Israelites from the restriction of carrying on marital relations with their wives by saying to them: \u201creturn to your tents\u201d (Deuteronomy 5,27-28).

In fact, Moses only brought the Tablets to within sight of the people in order to smash them before their eyes, so that they would understand what they had forfeited due to their disloyalty to G\u2019d.

This period corresponds to the time it takes for a fertilised egg in a woman\u2019s womb to achieve a critical status that permits us to refer to it as a fetus. Moses\u2019 stay on the mountain for such periods of time effected his spiritual progress in a similar manner, elevating him to higher spiritual dimensions. The evidence lies in the fact that eventually Moses\u2019 face radiated so much spiritual  illumination that the people were frightened by this phenomenon and Moses had to veil his head. (Exodus 34,29) Moses had been meant to achieve this stature already at the end of his first 40 days\u2019 stay on the mountain, but the people\u2019s making the golden calf and worshipping it, foiled this plan. G\u2019d Himself told Moses to descend due to his people having become corrupt (Exodus 32,7). According to our tradition, Moses\u2019 second stay of forty days on the mountain was a period when G\u2019d\u2019s anger at the people had not yet abated, so that he could not be rewarded with the distinction G\u2019d had in mind for him. He attained that distinction only during his third stay on the mountain when he was also instructed concerning the construction of the Tabernacle seeing that he was told to place the second set of Tablets in the Holy Ark (Exodus 25,21). This did not refer to an ark within which to place the shattered first set of Tablets. In fact, according to tradition, seeing that the letters written by G\u2019d on the first set of Tablets had \u201cflown\u201d away, the remnants of those Tablets which were eventually placed in another ark are not referred to as \u201cThe testimony,\u201d seeing they did not contain any writing anymore at that point. (compare Pesachim 87) Commencing with 25,8 where G\u2019d says to Moses that He will take up permanent residence in the Tabernacle to be built, the first 2500 years of mankind\u2019s history where G\u2019d was equally accessible anywhere has come to an end, and there would be a centralised form of worship as part of the Jewish religion. Instead of G\u2019d permitting the erection of altars anywhere it pleased man, and His coming to meet man at such sites, (Exodus 20,20) now the roles are reversed and He will be in residence in His palace on earth, and anyone who wishes to pray to Him effectively will have to do this at that Temple. There will be groups of people charged with the sacrificial service in the Temple, the priests, and laymen will not be allowed into the inner sanctum of this Temple at all. This, in short, is the message of Exodus 28,1 \u201cand you (Moses) bring close (To Me) your brother Aaron.\u201d Actually, the tribe of Levi had not yet been selected until after the affair of the golden calf. Moses recalls that event in Deuteronomy 10,8 and the events that had led up to it. In light of all this the fact that Moses spent 40 days and nights on the mountain each time he ascended there is very significant. The stage at which Moses\u2018 face radiated these rays of light was not achieved until the end of Moses\u2019 third stay on the mountain after he had been commanded to erect the Tabernacle. After the building of the Tabernacle had been completed,  as well as the making of the priestly garments, and the incense and oil anointing, Moses revealed the stages that preceded it, telling the people that at the end of the first forty days on the mountains he received the first set of Tablets. Any delay in the carrying out of G\u2019d\u2019s original timetable for these events was not due to G\u2019d delaying His plan but to the conduct of the people in the interval that had forced Him to revise His timetable. Had the episode of the golden calf not intervened, Moses\u2019 second and third stay on the mountain would have been totally superfluous. The episodes described in Exodus 32,7, 33,12 and 34,1 until 34 28-29 were only caused by the repercussions of the sin of the golden calf.\n"}, "24": {"0": {"0": "\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d7\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d4, tell the stewards of Israel that I desire that they should collect a contribution for Me.

[I will paraphrase from here on in. Ed.]The author perceives of different degrees of holiness, just as the kabbalists perceive holiness in the extra terrestrial world as consisting of spiritually progressively higher different levels. The outer structure known as \u05ea\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9, \u201cthe format,\u201d visual image, lead up to the cherubs in the innermost part of that structure. The very concept of the Tabernacle leads the intelligent viewer to conclude that hidden deep within it, G\u2019d\u2019s presence, \u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 must be manifest. The prophet Isaiah 6,2 phrased this as the \u05e9\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05de\u05e2\u05dc \u05dc\u05d5, the types of angels of a rank known as \u201cSeraphim\u201d were in attendance above G\u2019d\u2019s throne. This was the closest to G\u2019d\u2019s essence that the prophets were shown in their visions. The terrestrial Tabernacle, if viewed as parallel to G\u2019d\u2019s throne in the celestial domains, contained different sections of progressively higher levels of sanctity which progressively restricted the type of people allowed to approach those levels. The Torah itself, for which the Holy Ark served as repository, was in an ark constructed of wood but overlaid with gold on the inside and on the outside, to reflect the saying of our sages in Yuma 72 that every Torah scholar whose external appearance did not reflect his internal stature is not a Torah scholar at all. The levels of sanctity in the Tabernacle, beginning already with the courtyard around it, were not sealed off from one another, but, on the contrary, were connected to one another all the way to the innermost sanctuary to demonstrate that sanctity is attainable progressively. On top of the physical box containing the spiritual teaching, the Torah, there was placed a lid also made from pure gold which symbolised the image of G\u2019d. [in the sense that man was created in the image of G.d.] This lid was not linked, attached, to the ark itself at all. The detached nature of this \u201clid, \u05db\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea,\u201d symbolised that at a certain level of holiness there is no longer a physical bond with the human body, with the terrestrial domain, a domain which is essentially mortal, i.e. requiring regeneration from time to time. The description of the cherubs on top of the \u05db\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea facing each other (verse 20) symbolises the interaction of the spiritual message contained in the Torah and its transmission to the human being studying it. The cherubs themselves are described as facing the lid, i.e. facing the Torah that is beneath that lid. As a result of such an attitude to Torah, i.e. looking to it for inspiration, the cherubs are then described as spreading their wings in an upward direction, as if reflecting that they had received spiritual inspiration enabling them to fly. This description of the cherubs\u2019 posture reflects what Solomon described in Proverbs 15,24 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05dc, \u201cfor an intelligent man the path of life is upward.\u201d As a result of our relating to Torah in the manner described, we will merit what Isaiah 66,2 describes as \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8, when he refers to the prerequisite character traits necessary to merit Divine inspiration.", "3": {"0": "\u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5, the corners at its outer edges.", "1": "\u05d5\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d8\u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05e6\u05dc\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05ea, the side, wall of the Ark, is called \u05e6\u05dc\u05e2. G\u2019d had commanded therefore that these rings be attached at the four corners of the Ark. G\u2019d therefore commanded that there were to be four such rings at the four corners. Furthermore, G\u2019d commanded that they not be attached along the short sides of the Ark but along the long sides of the ark. [this contradicts the commentary of both Rashi  and Rash\u2019bam. Ed.]\n"}, "4": "\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df, the details were spelled out seeing this vessel had nothing to do with, and would not have been suitable for, sacrificial service.", "5": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd, our prophets have already explained to us that when they had visions involving angels, such angels appeared to them in the guise of cherubs. This means that they had faces like humans but were equipped with wings. In spite of appearing as if physical beings, the fact that they represented disembodied intelligence was indicated by the fact that their motion was ever upwards when the prophet observed them as if being in motion. In other words, any motion ascribed to them was in the direction of facing towards G\u2019d exclusively. Each one of these cherubs, whenever and to whomsoever they appeared, did so according to his respective level, rank, in the celestial hierarchy. \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9 \u05db\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd, the cherubs were always in a posture of having extended wings. The human intelligence is one that aspires to attain union with its counterpart (the source from which it is derived). The process leading to this involves the understanding of certain mental disciplines in which the owner of this intelligence divests himself of any and all consideration involving concretization, i.e. concepts involving the material universe. Only in this manner can a human being attain the kind of understanding of the Divine that he is willing and capable of attaining, each according to the level of his intelligence and his piety. Such insights are achieved by intelligently looking at the manifestations of G\u2019d in this world, studying about His attributes by gaining knowledge about how and when He does intervene in history by overriding the laws of nature which He Himself formulated and instituted. Knowing under what circumstances G\u2019d will resort to such extraordinary miracles, and appreciating the rationale behind it, is what enables the prophet at certain times to evoke G\u2019d\u2019s direct involvement in the fates of individuals. When Moses asked G\u2019d \u05d4\u05df\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05da, \u201cplease instruct me in Your ways,\u201d (33,13) he wanted precisely these kinds of guidelines. When the Torah describes the cherubs as \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9 \u05db\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4, this describes the source from which all this inspiration has to come. The sages already explained that these cherubs had the faces of a young boy and a young girl, (Yuma 54) a reference to the initiation of actions originating in a domain which is part of the abstract world. What is initiated there resembles something masculine, as the male is symbolic of initiating matters whereas the female\u2019s role is more responsive in nature. \u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5, this describes that what is initiated in abstract, disembodied regions of the universe, i.e. in heaven, is accepted, received willingly and in a complementary fashion by the creatures in this concrete, i.e. physical part of the universe, Only by a merging of these two basic constituent parts of our universe can \u201cperfection\u201d on earth be attained. The reason why the Torah continues in describing these cherubs as facing the lid of the Ark, i.e. looking downwards whereas their wings are spread upwards, is a reminder that although inspiration originates in heaven, understanding of G\u2019d and how He works can only come by paying close attention and studying what He does in our material, \u201clower\u201d part of His universe. The ideal means of unraveling the meaning of G\u2019d\u2019s actions is through His revealed word, the Torah, of which the Ark has become the repository. The upshot of the message contained in the symbolism represented by the cherubs, their shape, their posture, etc., is that for us on earth the key to obtain all these insights must be obtained by study of the Torah. By giving us the Torah, allowing us to build the Tabernacle, etc.,", "6": "\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05da \u05e9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea\u05da, G\u2019d assures Moses that this is the site where He will communicate with him and become as familiar to him as it is possible for G\u2019d to become familiar to man.

According to our sages in Yuma 72 the crown-like border surrounding the surface of the table symbolised the crown of the kingdom of G\u2019d. A king\u2019s task in administering the affairs of state is divided into two aspects. 1) He must dispense justice, or appoint people who see to it that justice is dispensed. 2) He must concern himself with the defense of the realm, again, either personally, or by delegating his authority to loyal experts.

Accordingly, the table actually had two \u201ccrowns.\u201d (this exegesis differs from that of Rashi who holds that there was only one such \u201ccrown.\u201d) One of the \u201ccrowns\u201d is for the table as such, the table symbolising the physical nourishment of the people and the general  conduct of its affairs, the second symbolises an \u201cenclosure, security fence,\u201d \u05de\u05e1\u05d2\u05e8\u05ea, a defensive system against harm to the people from whatever source, signaling that any attacker will not only be repelled but will be crushed.", "8": "\u05e7\u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5, these vessels were popularly used at Royal banquets, etc.", "9": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8. This commandment follows the establishment of \u201c2 crowns,\u201d the crown of Torah as represented by the Ark, and the crown of Royalty as represented by the Table. The Torah arranged the subject of the Menorah as something that it totally integrated, i.e. just as the Menorah was to be constructed of a single chunk of gold, not as a composite structure, so the seven lights were also to be arranged in such a way that the light from the lamps would converge in one above the light burning on top of the central shaft.

Inasmuch as the lights symbolised spiritual \u201cenlighten-ment,\u201d the lesson is that in all our efforts at obtaining such enlightenment, and during all the digressions that the pursuit of such disciplines necessarily entails, we must never lose sight of the direction in which we are striving and keep this central idea of such enlightenment resulting in us becoming better servants of the Lord, constantly in front of our mental eye. The reason that there were lights on both the right side of the center shaft as well as on the left side, is that pursuit of enlightenment expresses itself both in gaining of theoretical knowledge, ethical imperatives, but no less so in the practical application of such lessons learned.

We also find another description of a similar type in Kings I 22,19 where the prophet Michayah describes his vision of G\u2019d in these words: \u201cI saw the Lord seated on His throne with all the host of heaven standing in attendance to the right and to the left of Him.\u201d \n", "1": "\u05d7\u05de\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, the decorative weaving patterns of these curtains should match each curtain to its counterpart.

Even though the respective level of sanctity of the two parts of the structure was not uniform, what they had in common was that both reflected the fact  that the will of their Creator had been carried out.

It is reminiscent of what David said in Psalms 19,5 where the subjects are the different planetary forces and their orbits, each of them closer or further from the center, the sun. All of them represent forces created by G\u2019d to help run an orderly universe, and all of them, in David\u2019s own words, proclaim G\u2019d\u2019s handiwork; yet at the end, David reminds us that G\u2019d appointed the sun as a \u201ctent\u201d to \u201ccover\u201d them all, i.e. their diversity.

Seeing that there was only a minimal amount of fire kept going thereon this did not damage or burn wood underneath the gold overlay.<br> The reason that this altar has not been mentioned together with the major altar standing outside the sanctuary, details of which the Torah described in Parshat Terumah, is that this altar was not intended to ensure that the Shechinah made its permanent home among the Jewish people.

(compare how G\u2019d defined this purpose in Exodus 25,8-9) Its purpose was also not to attract the glory of the Lord into the Tabernacle, as was the purpose of all the other communal sacrifices burnt-offering, gift offerings, etc. Concerning G\u2019d\u2019s response to those offerings we had read in Exodus 29,43 \u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201cand there I will meet with the Children of Israel.\u201d Moses himself had confirmed that this was the purpose of the furnishings, etc., in the Tabernacle when he said: (Leviticus 9,6) \u201cand as a result the glory of the Lord will become manifest to you.\u201d<br> The sole purpose of the golden altar was to honour G\u2019d after He had accepted our service with goodwill mornings and evenings.

This being so, it is most appropriate that at the time of such count he should pay some ransom on behalf of his soul, his life, so that he will qualify for atonement.

The truth of this was amply demonstrated even with women who did not live in the land of Canaan in Numbers 22,5.", "9": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9 \u05de\u05e1\u05db\u05d4, graven images; some cameos, worn at times when certain horoscopes, constellations, dominate the sky; they are intended to protect the wearer. (compare Maimonides, Moreh, 1,63) The reason why these cameos are cast is that all of their parts must be made simultaneously, symbolising the simultaneous appearance of such constellations of certain stars. The people serving these constellations believe that they can improve the quality of their lives by means of goodwill extended to them by these stars. The Torah warns against this practice because the person doing this may not even consider that this constitutes a rebellion against the Creator seeing he does not accept these stars as \u201cgods.\u201d G\u2019d looks at the matter differently, not wanting any of us to turn to any source other than Him for all our wishes and prayers.

The offering of the firstborns are designed to ensure that our summer time activities will be blessed. This commandment was given immediately after the Exodus. It is intended to ensure that our livestock will be blessed. Third is the commandment to observe the Sabbath, a commandment given to the people at Marah, several weeks before the revelation at Mount Sinai. The objective of Sabbath observance is to ensure that our endeavours during the six days of the week will be blessed with success. The fourth commandment is that of observing the festival of Shavuot, in the early summer, as a result of which the grain harvest will be blessed. The fifth commandment mentioned here is the Sukkot festival, observance of which is to ensure the success of the grape harvest, etc. Deuteronomy 16,17 spells out that the festivals\u2019 aim is to make us conscious of the blessings we have been given by G\u2019d.<br> Having listed specific commandments, the Torah adds a comprehensive commandment applying on each of the three festivals mentioned previously, the pilgrimage to be made by the males to the Temple.<br>This is followed by some details about the festival of matzot in verse 25, followed by a commandment usually observed on Shavuot, the harvest festival, when most of the first fruit has ripened already (verse 26) and the bringing of the first ripened fruit by each farmer accompanied by a thanksgiving prayer is in full swing until Sukkot. This, in turn, is followed by a prohibition not to boil the kid in the milk of its mother, seeing that it is the time of year when most young goats are born.

Seeing that one category of \u201cunclean\u201d animal, the donkey, is also part of this legislation, though, of course such an animal is not fit to be sacrificed on the altar of the Temple, the Torah has to add certain qualifications when writing about this commandment. Whereas the \u201cpure\u201d firstborn may not be redeemed and made secular, but must themselves be offered on the altar, their blood and fat remaining there, the donkey either has to be redeemed or to be killed in a manner that precludes its flesh being used commercially.

Both the weekly Sabbath, and the seven-yearly \u201cSabbath\u201d have been called Sabbath by the Torah.

The demons on the one hand are mortal, made of tangible raw material as mentioned Chagigah 16 The Torah called the judges, experts, also by the name elohim. This is justified if they carry out their task properly by freeing themselves of emotions which would make them partial, subjective.

In other words, one did not refer to it only by the name of the category of utensils it belonged to, such as \u201cfork,\u201d but one had a name for each fork. This method of naming each item individually contributed to their being of permanent significance. The Talmud Yuma 71 goes to the length of stating categorically that if anyone thought that once such a utensil had been \u201cused up,\u201d i.e. had outlived its usefulness it would be permanently consigned to oblivion this is not so. It will even resurface after the resurrection of the people who used it when they were alive. This is derived from Exodus 26,15 \u05e2\u05e6\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, the word \u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd being taken to mean that they will endure indefinitely. Neither will any of the utensils used in the Tabernacle fall into the hands of our enemies. This is the opposite of what happened to the \u201cpermanent\u201d Temple, \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, built by Solomon. It is significant that in the account of what Nebuchadnezzar captured not a word is mentioned about a single item that used to be part of the Tabernacle in the desert.", "1": "\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea, the Torah begins to list the many ways in which this Temple (Tabernacle) was superior to  those that superseded it. Firstly, it was the \u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea, so named because the Tablets of the Testimony were deposited therein. Secondly, \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e4\u05e7\u05d3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4, it had been put up at the command of Moses; thirdly, \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05de\u05e8, the entire service of the Levites had been entrusted to the illustrious Ittamar, son of Aaron. Fourthly, \u05d5\u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d1\u05df \u05d7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4,  the divinely inspired Betzalel was its principal architect. In view of all the above advantages of this structure none of it fell into enemy hands.<br> By contrast, the Temple erected by Solomon, most of the work for which was performed by labourers from Tzor, even though the Shechinah came to rest on it, was eventually destroyed, all of it having been lost totally. The inferiority of that structure is evident from the fact that the building itself was in need of regular, almost annual, repairs, as we know from Kings II 22,5 The second Temple was so inferior that it could not even be called \u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea, the residence of the Testimony, the Tablets having long since been lost. Neither had it been established by G\u2019d\u2019s command but by a dream that a gentile named King Cyrus dreamed that it was his duty to build a temple to the G\u2019d in heaven. Compare Ezra 8,15. Moreover, there were hardly any Levites that bothered to return to the land of Israel at the time to take part in that return to Zion. In addition to this, consider that among the people building this second Temple, there were also pagans called Tzidonim and Tzurim, as documented in the Book of Ezra.\n"}, "2": "\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4\u05d1, the Torah testifies that the contributions of gold, silver, and copper for the building of the Tabernacle were miniscule in value when compared to the amount of such precious metals which were used in the building of Solomon\u2019s Temple. We read there in Kings I 6, 20-35 and 7, 45-50 about the opulence of that structure. Compared to the restoration of the second Temple in the days of Herod, even Solomon\u2019s Temple could be considered a poor attempt at impressing the world with the Jewish people\u2019s wealth. Notwithstanding all the material wealth invested in both Solomon\u2019s Temple and that of Herod, Moses\u2019 Tabernacle, a collapsible structure, enjoyed far more of G\u2019d\u2019s presence than the Temple Solomon built, not to speak of the second Temple in which the Presence of G\u2019d was never manifest. All of these historical facts teach us that material wealth, even if donated generously, is not a major factor in the success of a Temple dedicated to house the Presence of G\u2019d on earth. G\u2019d\u2019s presence in such a Temple depends on His approval of the lifestyle of the Jews who have built such a Temple for Him.\n"}, "38": {"0": "\u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e8\u05d3, covers about which the only information we have is that the picture on each indicated which object each one was to cover.", "1": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e4\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4\u05d1, the donours of the gold for the priestly garment already flattened the gold into thin stripes so they could easily be converted and cut into \u201cthreads\u201d to be embroidered in these garments.", "1": "\u05d5\u05e7\u05e6\u05e5 \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, the respective artisan.
