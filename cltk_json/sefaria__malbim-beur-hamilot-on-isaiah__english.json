But they did not check this matter well, because this is true only in reference to the body of the sun, when the speaker describes it as coming out from its place beyond the eastern horizon and heading toward its destination at the western. Then its \u2019coming\u2019 is the moment it reaches  its destination in the west. This is not so when speaking of the light, whose purpose is reached when its rays touch that which is illuminated, then it has come to its place. \u201cYour light\u201d refers to the light which comes of itself, and the rising of the glory of Gd is the light of prophecy - they will shine upon you until there are as the light of the sun upon the moon, as I wrote elsewhere (see Is. 60:19). On this it says \u201c\u2026and kings by the brilliance of your shine,\u201d (Yeshayahu 60:3) because \u2018shine\u2019 refers to the light of the moon as I mentioned above (verses 13 and 14, and 19 below)."]}}
