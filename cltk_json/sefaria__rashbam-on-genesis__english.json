This is what the Talmud (Shabbat 63) had in mind when it quoted Rav Kahane saying that he had studied the Talmud until the age of 18 and had not yet appreciated that although the laws of the Torah are derived from the text, none of the interpretations are such that they can uproot the plain meaning of the text. They are based on anomalies in the text, not on the text itself wherever the law derived from the Torah appears to conflict with the plain meaning of the text. One example is Genesis 2,4 where the word \u05d1\u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05dd, a most unusual construction, used by the sages to declare that the world was created \u201cfor the sake of, or with the help of \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd,\u201d (Bereshit Rabbah 12,9) seeing that the letters in that word are the same as the ones in the name \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd, [though in a different sequence. Ed.]<br> I shall list the explanations of earlier commentators of old, in order to demonstrate why I did not follow in their footsteps. Some scholars understand the first verse to mean that \u201cat the beginning G\u2019d created heaven and earth.\u201d This is an erroneous explanation, seeing that water preceded the creation of heaven and earth as we know from verse 2 where \u201cthe spirit of G\u2019d\u201d is described as already \u201chovering over the surface of the water.\u201d Moreover, the Torah did not write \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4, which would have been appropriate if it had wanted to tell us that heaven and earth preceded all other phenomena in the universe. The word \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea is in a construct mode, as in Genesis 10,10 \u05d5\u05ea\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d1\u05dc \u201cthe mainstay of his kingdom was Babylon.\u201d A construct mode like this cannot describe the commencement of something but refers to something already in existence. As to the scholars who understand the word as equivalent to the word \u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 in Hoseah 1,2 i.e. so that it would mean \u201cat the beginning G\u2019d created the heaven,\u201d i.e. before He created heaven and earth there was chaos, darkness on the face of the water, etc., so that it emerges that water had been created first, this too is nonsense. How could the Torah refer to a state of the earth prior to creation of the heaven?<br> The plain meaning of the text is, as occurs many times, that something may be mentioned first in one instance although elsewhere this same phenomenon is mentioned as having occurred at a later stage. In Genesis 9,18 we are told about the three sons of Noach who left the ark after the deluge being Shem, Cham and Yephet, and the Torah adds that Cham was the father of Canaan. Although the information about Canaan is quite out of place at this juncture, the fact that later on the Torah tells us that Noach cursed Canaan, makes it necessary to mention him here, as otherwise we would not have known who this Canaan was whom Noachh cursed in verse 25 of the same chapter. We have a similar situation in Genesis 35,22 where, although Reuven\u2019s conduct with Yaakov\u2019s concubine Bilhah is mentioned, Yaakov\u2019s reaction is not mentioned until shortly before his death when he explains why Reuven had not been viewed by him as suitable to occupy the position normally accorded to a firstborn (Genesis 49,3-4). In 35,22 the Torah already tells us that Yaakov had heard about what Reuven had done. Had the Torah not done so, the reader would have been taken aback at Yaakov\u2019s remonstrating with Reuven at this late stage.<br> There are many such examples. Our entire paragraph here was written by Moses in order for us to understand what is written in the Ten Commandments concerning the reason why the Sabbath is holy, i.e. that it is a symbol reminding us of the fact that G\u2019d created the universe in 6 days and rested on the seventh day. (Exodus 20,10) If anyone were to think that the universe as such had already existed then in the format that we see it now, the Torah corrects such thinking by continuing with", "1": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4, the earth had preceded and existed in a chaotic form, as elaborated on by the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 4,23) \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05dd...\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd  \u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05e3 \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d3\u05d5 \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 (Jeremiah 9,9) ", "1": "This verse explains the meaning of \u201cTohu vavohu\u201d in greater detail, i.e. that there was no kind of life on earth at that stage.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05e9\u05da \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d4\u05d5\u05dd, this is a reference to the absence of light in the heaven.", "3": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e8\u05d7\u05e4\u05ea (\u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea) \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, we had to be told that G\u2019d\u2019s wind was active at that stage, else verse 9 of this chapter in which G\u2019d issues a directive for the waters to collect in a contiguous area would not make sense, as we could not have understood how the waters were made to assemble all in one area of the globe.

Whenever, in Scriptures, G\u2019d is recorded as mentioning \u201cday\u201d and \u201cnight,\u201d as for instance in Genesis 8,22, where He made the promise that \u201chenceforth the alternating manifestations of day and night will not cease to occur regularly,\u201d \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5\u05df, this is a reference to the original light created on the first day. G\u2019d always called this \u201clight\u201d \u201cnight and day.\u201d Similarly, every time in this chapter when we encounter the expression \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, as well as when we read in Numbers 13,15 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2 \u05d1\u05df \u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2, whereas the same man as representative of the tribe of Ephrayim had been referred to as \u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2 only 7 verses earlier as \u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2. This was the same man, who, previously, when he appeared in his position of Moses\u2019 personal valet was already known as \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2, (Exodus 24,13) It is customary among kings that when they appoint a person to a position of eminence to signal this by changing the name of such a person. One well known example of this is Pharaoh calling Joseph \u05e6\u05e4\u05e0\u05ea \u05e4\u05e0\u05d7 upon appointing him as viceroy of Egypt (Genesis 41,45) Other such examples are found in Daniel 1,7, etc.", "1": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05e9\u05da \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4, \u201cwhereas He had already named the darkness \u2018night.\u2019\u201d Seeing that mention of light always precedes mention of darkness, the Torah first told us of the name G\u2019d gave to \u201clight.\u201d", "2": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8.

This is the period when G\u2019d made the light of the first day fade. The subsequent expression \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8 refers to the morning after the night when dawn rose. At this point the first of the 6 \u201cdays\u201d of G\u2019d\u2019s creative activity of which He spoke in the Ten Commandments had come to an end.

This noun is also a derivative from the word \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3, loving kindness, i.e. a \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3 is a creature equipped with this attribute of loving G\u2019d.

To mention just one or two such examples: Exodus 23,21 \u05db\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5, \u201cbecause My Holy Name is within him.\u201d Or, Exodus 3 3,2 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05da \u05d4' \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9 \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e1\u05e0\u05d4, \u201can angel of Hashem appeared to him in the form of a flame of fire in the midst of the thorn bush.\u201d [the unusual fire which failed to consume, destroy, the thorn bush represented a Divine appearance. Ed.] Or, in verse 4 of the same chapter: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d4' \u05db\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cwhen G\u2019d (i.e. the angel) saw that he had turned aside to watch the spectacle.\u201d ", "1": "\u05db\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd, why would the Torah need to relate this apparently inconsequential piece of information (so that we read it aloud every week after over 3000 years)? The point the Torah wanted to make was that in the event that we compare Lot\u2019s reception of the angels, when he offered them lodging for the night, (Genesis 19,1) whereas Avraham only offered light refreshment, the reason for this is that the angels came to Lot in the evening, a time for travelers to find lodging, whereas here, seeing that they arrived during the midday heat, there was no reason to assume that they would not want to continue their journey."}, "1": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05df \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05db\u05dd.

Ed.] The expression\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4  as a variation of \u05e8\u05d1\u05d1 is found in Job 16,13 as it is in Psalms 48,13, where it is derived from the root \u05e1\u05d1\u05d1. A construction \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05d5 as a derivative of \u05e9\u05de\u05dd is found in Jeremiah 2,12, just as the construction \u05d3\u05d5\u05de\u05d5 derived from \u05d3\u05de\u05dd is found in Isaiah 23,2. Also, the expression \u05d3\u05de\u05de\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e7\u05d4, a very low voice, in Kings I 19,12 is a similar construction. The common feature in all these constructions is that the last root letter appears twice in succession. Our example of \u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 is different, seeing that there is no such repetition of the last root letter. Therefore its root is \u05e8\u05d1\u05d4, and the construction is similar to \u05e2\u05d5\u05e9\u05d4 from \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4, or \u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 from \u05d1\u05e0\u05d4, or \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 from \u05e7\u05e0\u05d4.\n", "8": "\u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05df, as predicted in 16,12 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd.", "9": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0, at the time when Yitzchok was born by Sarah and Avimelech had become a first-hand witness to the miracles G\u2019d had performed for Avraham. This is why he and his chief general were now interested in concluding an alliance with Avraham. Every time the expression \u05d1\u05e2\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 occurs it must be understood in terms of happenings immediately preceding the ones to which the next paragraph is linked.", "10": " \u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05db\u05d3\u05d9, to my grandson.", "11": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e2 \u05d0\u05e9\u05dc, an orchard.

Examples are found in 15,1 after Avraham had killed the four kings who had taken Lot captive. At that time G\u2019d had told him not to be afraid of any repercussions. We also find such a construction in verse 20 of our chapter where the Avraham was informed of the birth of Rivkah after we heard that Yitzchok had been born. We find a similar construction also in Esther 3,1 where Mordechai told Esther and she told the king about the assassination plot by Bigtan and Teresh. The event occurred around the time when Haman was promoted and wanted to kill Mordechai and the Jewish people. The fact that he had saved the king\u2019s life became the immediate cause of Mordechai\u2019s rise in the king\u2019s esteem. [if I understand the author correctly, he wants to tell us that although sequentially the matters related are not immediate chronologically, the Torah or Scriptures use the formulation to trace them to events which occurred some time back. Yitzchok was at least 37 years old before Avraham heard about the birth of Rivkah. Similarly, if the king had rewarded Mordechai for his part in discovering the plot immediately, history might have taken a different course. Ed.] Here too, the words mean that what follows occurred after Avraham and Avimelech had concluded their covenant according to which until the fourth generation Avraham\u2019s descendants would not register a claim against lands owned by the Philistines at this time. G\u2019d became very angry at this high-handed action by Avraham, seeing that he had given away lands which were part of what G\u2019d had promised to Avraham and his descendants at the \u201ccovenant of the pieces\u201d in chapter 15. We know that a condition of that covenant had been not to allow a single soul of the Canaanites to survive in that land, according to both Deuteronomy 20,16 as well as according to Joshua 13,3 and 15,45-47. Clearly lots had been cast concerning the lands owned by the 5 Philistine rulers, and who was to settle in those lands after the conquest. As a result of Avraham\u2019s high-handed action,", "1": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e1\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd, G\u2019d now subjected Avraham to a painful test, something which was bound to cause him grief. Whenever the root \u05e0\u05e1\u05d4 occurs, such as in Job 4,2 or Exodus 17,7 or Psalms 26,2 the connotation is an unpleasant one for the one being subjected to it. In this instance, G\u2019d, so to speak, indicated to Avraham that he had been foolish to think that he could guarantee\u2019s Yitzchok\u2019s and his descendants well being into the future, as he might have to terminate his life before he even had produced any offspring who would be called upon to honour his father\u2019s deal with Avimelech. We find that the ark of the covenant spent seven months in Philistine captivity as a result of Avraham having made such an unauthorised pact with Avimelech (Samuel I 6,1). The seven months corresponded to the seven sheep Avraham had gratuitously given to Avimelech. G\u2019d swore that as a result the Philistines would fight seven wars against the Israelites in which they would be victorious. These wars occurred during the time of Shimshon, Chofni, Pinchos, Sha-ul, and the three sons of Sha-ul who were killed. Another approach: as a result of Avraham\u2019s high-handed act seven altars (public altars equivalent of temples) were destroyed by the enemies of the Jewish people after they entered the Holy Land Land, They were: Moses\u2019 Tabernacle, Gilgal, Nov, Shiloh, Givon and the two Temples in Jesrusalem.

Here when Avraham\u2019s principal son, Yitzchok is the subject of the paragraph, it was important to repeat who had fathered him. He was the son of Avraham\u2019s true wife, his lifetime companion, and G\u2019d had predicted in Genesis 21,12 that Avraham\u2019s descendants would always be known through his son Yitzchok and his descendants.

We find other examples of great people who pursue a path that does not conform with G\u2019d\u2019s will that as a result they experience punishment for ignoring G\u2019d\u2019s will. As soon as Moses refused the mission and told G\u2019d to send someone else, (Exodus 4,13) we find that G\u2019d became angry at him. According to the plain meaning of the text there, although the sages say that wherever G\u2019d\u2019s anger is mentioned the subject at whom G\u2019d is angry is visibly punished, whereas there is no word about Moses being punished for his words \u05e9\u05dc\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05ea\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7, Aaron who was meant to function only as a Levite, became the High Priest, a role which Moses would have filled but for his improper refusal to accept G\u2019d\u2019s mission without demurring. This is an explanation based on an allegorical approach, whereas the plain meaning is that at the inn, when on his way to Egypt, Moses was almost killed for having been remiss in not circumcising his son Eliezer before setting out on his journey. Jonah, too was punished for trying to circumvent the will of G\u2019d and spent three most uncomfortable days inside one or more fish. Similarly, G\u2019d\u2019s anger resulted in Bileam being harmed by his ass when contravening G\u2019d\u2019s will and setting out on his way to curse the Jewish people  (Numbers 22,22 indicates that he walked with a pronounced limp, presumably due to having his leg squeezed against the wall by his ass as per Numbers 22,25.\n", "19": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e6\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d9\u05e8\u05db\u05d5, now that the sun was shining he realised that he was walking with a limp, a belated discovery, just as when he discovered that he had spent a night in bed with Leah thinking that she was Rachel (29,25).", "20": "\u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05df \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5, as a reminder of the heroism displayed by Yaakov, as well as a reminder of the miracle that G\u2019d performed for him as a result of which he did not die."}, "25": {"0": "\u05e0\u05d2\u05e9 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05dc, normally, the males are mentioned before the females.

What happened here is that the first time Timna is mentioned, she is described in terms of he relationship to Avraham\u2019s family, i.e. as the concubine of a great grandson of Avraham, Eliphaz, son of Esau, whereas the second time Timna is described as a sister of Lotan (verse 22) not genetically related to Avraham at all, but part of the genealogy of the \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8.

Now, the Reubenites and the Gadites, along with the other half tribe of Menashe had already received their shares which Moses assigned to them on the east side of the Jordan- as assigned to them by Moses the servant of the Lord.\u201d There can be no question that something is missing here as part of the second verse. You would have to say that this verse answered the question implied by the first verse, i.e. \u201cwhat about the other half of the tribe of Menashe?\u201d The reason for this peculiar division in describing the tribal allocation for the tribe of Menashe is that one half of the tribe, i.e. the half mentioned last, received their allocation by the authority of Moses himself, whereas the second half of the tribe received its allocation by the authority of Joshua. I, Samuel, (our author) have found a third verse [in addition to the two mentioned in the Midrash quoted.

In that sequence mention of Achaz is missing in the first of the two verses so that he appears out of nowhere in the second verse. Not only that but he is introduced with the connective letter \u05d5, i.e. \u201cand Achaz, etc. We must therefore conclude that the word \u05d5\u05d0\u05d7\u05d6 \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3, \u201cand Achaz begot,\u201d answers the verse which had in effect been interrupted in 8,35 with the word \u05d0\u05d7\u05d6.

Seeing that Lotan was the outstanding one among his brothers, Timna\u2019s genealogy is linked to her prominent brother rather than to her father. We have encountered the same principle when Machalat whom Esau married to assuage the hurt feelings of his parents, is described as the sister of Nevayot, a son of Yishmael.

Even though these sons of Tzivon are also referred to by the names Ayah and Adah in Chronicles I 1,40, we need not attribute too much meaning to this, as there are numerous instances when such names are not accurately reported.  (Examples of such inaccuracies are Genesis 10,23 where the letters \u05d5 in the words \u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc \u05d5\u05d2\u05ea\u05e8 (names) clearly are not part of the names themselves.

The very letters \u05d5 whom these commentators quote as support for their thesis are themselves not connective letters For instance, in Samuel II 13,20 the line \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1 \u05ea\u05de\u05e8 \u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05d1\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4, the word \u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05de\u05d4 means the same as \u05e9\u05d1\u05d9, as in \u05e9\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05de\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05da, (Genesis 38,11) where Yehudah tells his daughter-in-law (also) called Tamar to await Shelah\u2019s growing up by remaining like a grieving widow in her father\u2019s house. The word \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1 in Samuel II 13.20 has two meanings. It tells us that Tamar henceforth was isolated, lonely, an outcast. The word \u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3\u05d4 for \u201clonely,\u201d is implied but not spelled out, and the whole line must be understood as if the prophet had written \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1 \u05ea\u05de\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05de\u05d4, \u201cTamar lived lonely and abandoned in the house of her brother Avshalom.\u201d Psalms 76,7 \u05de\u05d2\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea\u05da \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05e0\u05e8\u05d3\u05dd \u05d5\u05e8\u05db\u05d1 \u05d5\u05e1\u05d5\u05e1, must be understood as \u05de\u05d2\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05e0\u05e8\u05d3\u05dd \u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, at Your blast, O G\u2019d of Yaakov, horse and chariot (with our enemies) lay stunned.\u201d The reference is to the army mentioned in the preceding verses.

While it is true that the Torah, by means of allusions, grammatical anomalies, tone-signs, etc., teaches us far more than meets the eye when we look at the bald text, there are strict limitations even to these methods of exegesis such as the thirteen principles of Rabbi Yishmael and the 32 principles of Rabbi Yossi Haglili. Exegetes of former times, thanks to their piety, relied exclusively on the drashot i.e. allegorical and ethical interpretations of anomalies in the text of the Torah, thereby neglecting a thorough study of the text as it presents itself to the average, though not scholarly, reader. Seeing that our sages stated \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05d1\u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df, \u201cdo not burden your children overly with interpretation based on logic, on common sense,\u201d and they also said\u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7 \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05de\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d3\u05d4, \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7 \u05d1\u05ea\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05da \u05de\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05d6\u05d5, \u201che who studies the written text of the Torah has accomplished something positive but has also failed to accomplish something positive, but on the other hand, he who has studied Talmud has chosen by far the best path in Torah study,\u201d (freely translated), the result of such statements has been that students have not become used to studying the plain meaning of the text without immediately looking at exegesis. (Baba Metzia 33 and a source supposedly in Berachot 28, the correct text being \u05de\u05e0\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df, prevent your children from indulging in speculative reason,\u201d but this does not seem to have any connection with Torah exegesis in the context where the statement is made. Ed.] This principle has been illustrated in Shabbat 63; we read there in the name of Rav Kahane \u201cI was already eighteen years old and had studied the entire Talmud, but had not ever been taught of the principle that \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5, \u201cthat the text in the written Torah must not be interpreted in a manner which completely nullifies its plain meaning.\u201d Also Rabbi Shlomoh, my mother\u2019s father of blessed memory (Rashi) the brilliant exegete, who wrote commentaries on the entire Bible, was careful not to ignore the plain meaning of the text. I, Shmuel, son of Rabbi Meir, Rashi\u2019s son-in-law, have argued with him, and he admitted to me that if he had the opportunity, he would compose an additional commentary in which he would concentrate on the plain meaning as it became clearer to him with each passing day. [I believe that the wording here means that Rashi meant that just as his published commentaries consisted mostly of anthologies, i.e. his quoting existing interpretations, so he would search out more commentaries based on the plain meaning to present to the reader when publishing another commentary. Ed.] I am now presenting to the reader what earlier exegetes had to say on our verse.", "1": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, \u201cthe following describes events and problems which Yaakov encountered in his life.\u201d [by the way, Seforno, who lived hundreds of years later than Rash\u2019bam, also accepts the interpretation described as nonsensical by Rash\u2019bam. Ed.] This exegesis is nonsense. Whenever the expression \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea occurs in the Bible, sometimes this word introduces the names of the grandsons of the party referred to, such as in Genesis 6,9 where the Torah after describing the righteousness of Noach tells us that Noach had three sons and proceeds to give us their names. The names of the sons could not be the purpose of the story there, as we had been told earlier in 5,32 that Noach at the age of 500 sired three sons and we were already told their names. The Torah then continues to describe mankind\u2019s ongoing corruption and that Noach was the only one with whom G\u2019d was pleased. When the Torah commences a second time with the line \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e0\u05d7 in 6,9, clearly the Torah does not mean to repeat itself, but it leads to the Torah telling us of Noach\u2019s grandchildren, something that is reported in greater detail in 10,1 under the heading of \u201cand these are the generations of the sons of Noach.\u201d [Perhaps the reason for the repetition of \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d7 in chapter 10, is that if, as the author says, the grandchildren were meant already in chapter 6, now after the deluge, the task of these children to generate a new mankind began in earnest, whereas up to that point they were charged with merely surviving the deluge. Ed.]  Just as the Torah reported the growth and development of mankind after the deluge until we have a total of 70 such descendants of Noach being named, so in chapter 36,6 we have been told of the descendants of Esau who have been born in the land of Canaan, i.e. the land in which his father lived. After that, the Torah reported Esau\u2019s further development in Mount Seir, commencing with verse 9 of that chapter. The Torah reports the development of Yaakov\u2019s family in a parallel manner, 35,23 extending through verses 26-27 and listing all his children who had been born in exile, while he was in Padan Aram with Lavan. Now the Torah continues with the words \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, concentrating forthwith on the grandchildren who combine to make up a total of 70 prior to the descent of the family to Egypt. Details of the birth of these various grandchildren are being provided, beginning with the chronicle of what happened to Joseph, who at 17 years of age experienced traumatic events, as a result of which his older brother Yehudah separated from the other brothers and started his own family in Keziv and Adulam, siring three sons, and grandsons respectively, i.e. Shelah, Peretz and Zerach. The history of Yaakov\u2019s family became complicated further with Joseph having been brought to Egypt as a slave where Menashe and Ephrayim were born for him. Having attained high office, Joseph invited his father and family to join him in Egypt so that ultimately 70 members of Yaakov\u2019s family wound up in Egypt. Moses had to record all this in order to substantiate his claim in Deuteronomy 10,22 that \u201cyour fathers descended to Egypt when they numbered only 70 persons.\u201d", "2": "\u05d1\u05df \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4, this was necessary so that we realise that the separation of Joseph from his father \u2013during which time Yaakov had considered his as dead- lasted for 22 years. The Torah testified in 41,26 that Joseph was 30 years old when presented to Pharaoh, after which time 7 good years and 2 years of famine occurred before Yaakov and family descended to settle in Egypt, making a total of 22 years of separation.", "3": "\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e6\u05d0\u05df, the sons of Leah, are referred to as his brothers, seeing that they were the sons of a major wife, as opposed to the sons of Zilpah and Bilhah who ranked lower on the social scale, though also half-brothers of Joseph.

He contrasted this with his own behaviour towards these half brothers of his, whom he professed to honour and spend extra time with them as proof of his considering them equal.

Why did the Torah bother to write this line? The reason is that when the brothers returned from Egypt and reported about Joseph\u2019s position there, and Yaakov did not believe them that Joseph was still alive, he saw the carriages which Pharaoh had sent to transport him in (45,27) and realised that such an honour could only be bestowed by a king, and that seeing that the King of Egypt had no reason to honour him in such a manner, the carriages, though sent with the approval of Pharaoh, must have been sent by someone in an almost equally high position, i.e. his son Joseph, who had dreamed of attaining such stature. It was the recollection of the dream Joseph had told him about which then prompted Yaakov to exclaim \u05e8\u05d1,\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d9, \u05d5\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cit is too much!

Compare also Deuteronomy 11,26, where the word \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 is used in the same manner, except that it does not involve active participation by those addressed", "13": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05dd, he saved his life, no more.", "14": {"0": "\u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8, where no one passes so that he will die from natural causes.", "1": "\u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05df \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc, in order to really save him.

However, if the Torah had not added these words, we would have been misled. The fact that the Torah describes the brothers sending the blood-spattered tattered remains of this tunic to their father (verse 33) was designed to deceive their father into believing that what happened to Joseph had nothing to do with his father having had this garment made for him and the brothers having resented this. The Torah does not want us, the readers, to be misled as the brothers had succeeded in misleading their father into thinking that he had become the victim of a wild animal.", "16": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05dd. If the pit had been full of water the brothers would not have thrown him into the pit, as they then would have been guilty of drowning him, i.e. killing him with their own hands, as it were. They had said themselves \u201clet not our hands be on him.\u201d", "17": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, while the brothers had been sitting down to consume their meal, having distanced themselves somewhat from the pit into which they had thrown Joseph in order not to be guilty of \u201ceating while spilling blood,\u201d they were waiting for the Ishmaelites whom they had seen in the distance, to arrive. During this period the Midianites, coming from a different direction had passed there, saw Joseph in the pit, pulled him up, and proceeded to sell him to the Ishmaelites. One may assume that the brothers had no knowledge of this. Even though the Torah appears to attribute the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites to the brothers, (based on Joseph accusing them of having sold him to Egypt, 45,4) we would have to say that because of their having been instrumental in bringing about that sale they are considered as if having assisted in that sale. This appears to me the deeper meaning of the plain meaning of the text both here and in chapter 45. The line describing the Midianites passing that way is described as something totally coincidental, having nothing to do with what the brothers had planned to do with Joseph. Even if the Torah says:\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 (\u05d0\u05ea) \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, this sounds as if the brothers did the selling. It is also possible that the brothers noting the Midianites suddenly materialising out of nowhere, instructed them to pull Joseph out of the pit after which they themselves sold him to the Ishmaelites.", "18": "\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d0!, what did I came to the pit for!", "19": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d5, by means of human messengers who would not identify themselves, saying only: \u201cthis is what we have found!\u201d", "20": {"0": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d3, I will not be consoled but will descend to my grave joining my son while still mourning his death.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05da \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5, for a long period of time.

The verse means: \u201dThe river raise ther \u201cvoices\u201d (sounds), O Lord, the oceans sound their thunder and their pounding.\u201d All of this is in response to verse 10 in the previous psalm where G\u2019d\u2019s enemies are described as perishing.\u201d In fact the psalmist in 94,3 asks almost despairingly: \u201chow long are the wicked going to be allowed to carry on successfully before the Just can rejoice when they observe their downfall?\u201d Here too, the words \u05d1\u05df \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 describe an attribute, referring to the tall and handsome person Joseph, before telling us that all the maidens of Egypt were craning their necks to catch a glimpse of him, each one trying to admire his features, trying to do so from a suitable vantage point. He, whose exterior had appealed to the wife of Potiphar at the time, now became a household word in Egypt so that all the women allowed out of their houses tried to catch a glimpse of him. [I paraphrased the author\u2019s words in this paragraph. Ed.] Joseph\u2019s handsome appearance had already inflamed the libido of Potiphar\u2019s wife,", "20": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5, they threw him into jail, ", "1": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5, and they harassed him.

We find the expression \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5 and \u05d7\u05e6\u05d9\u05d5 used in Job 16,13 as almost interchangeable. The dagesh in the letter \u05e6 of the word \u05d7\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd confirms that the whole word is used for emphasis, reinforcing the thought already expressed in the word \u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5 which also has such a dagesh. If the word \u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5 were derived from the root \u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4, quarrel, it would not have a dagesh\u00b8 just as \u05e7\u05de\u05d5 from \u05e7\u05d5\u05dd, or \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 from \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 do not have a dagesh. The word \u05e8\u05d1 in the sense in which it is used here also occurs in Judges 11,25 as emphasised by means of repetition, i.e. \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e8\u05d1, when Yiphtach refers to the extreme hostility to the Jewish people displayed by the Moabites. There was no need for the dagesh on that occasion as the word has already been repeated to show the emphasis Yiphtach had in mind. The Torah, i.e. Yaakov, calls the evil fabrication that the wife of Potiphar used to indict Joseph \u05d7\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd, arrows, a word used in the same sense by Jeremiah 9,7 when he says (of his own people, alas) \u05d7\u05e5 \u05e9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d8 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05dd, \u05de\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8, \u05d1\u05e4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5': \u201cTheir tongue is a sharpened arrow, they use their mouths to deceive; one speaks of his fellow peacefully, while laying an ambush for him, etc.\u201d", "2": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5, from the root \u05e8\u05d1\u05d1, similar to the relationship between \u05e1\u05d1\u05d5 and \u05e1\u05d1\u05d1, or \u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 from \u05e8\u05e0\u05df (compare Isaiah 12,6) \u05e6\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df, \u201cOh shout for joy you who dwell in Zion.\u201d The word \u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 is a repetition of the thought expressed in the word \u05e6\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9, designed to reinforce that thought."}, "21": {"0": "\u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05df \u05e7\u05e9\u05ea\u05d5, there is a certain heavy and strong bow called arbalatra which is seated on a strong wooden frame called purka, and which, if the archer pulls with all his might bringing his arms all the way back to his body, enables him to shoot the arrow over a longer distance. A weak individual cannot operate such a bow. We have to understand the verse as describing a scenario describing Egyptians shooting their arrows of hate at Joseph until he was imprisoned, bound hand and foot. Nonetheless, the same Joseph afterwards emerged and became king over his former tormentors. This was because his  \u05e7\u05e9\u05ea, bow, was stronger than that of his adversaries.
