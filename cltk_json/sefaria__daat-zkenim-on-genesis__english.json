[I presume that what the author means is that when we read the Torah, and the reader in the synagogue is facing east, as is customary in the synagogues in the northern hemisphere, the open side of that letter is on his left, i.e. north. Ed.] According to tradition, the letter \u05d0 complained to G\u2019d that it had not been allowed for the Torah to commence with it. What did G\u2019d do? He recompensed that letter by commencing the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai with the letter \u05d0, where we read: (Exodus 20,2) \u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5', \u201cI am the lord your G\u2019d, etc.\u201d The word \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea consists of 6 letters, symbolising the six days of creation; The first verse of the Torah has seven words, symbolising the numbers of days in a week. It contains 28 letters, symbolising the 28 days of the month.  [Perhaps the fact that the first letter is in a much bigger font compensates for the slight inaccuracy of the author stating the month has 28 days and not 29. Ed.] We also find the letter \u05d0 six times in that verse, symbolising the six thousand years this earth [after the creation of man, Ed.] is supposed to exist in the format as we know it. The meaning of the word aleph in Hebrew is \u201cone thousand.\u201d The second verse in the Torah, commencing with the word: \u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, immediately after the word \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cearth\u201d at the end of the preceding verse, symbolises that the period known as the period of Moshiach, is to last 2000 years. (Talmud, Sanhedrin folio 97) [the last two millennia preceding the arrival of the messianic age. Ed.] In Exodus 13,9 the Torah writes: \u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05df \u05ea\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4' \u05d1\u05e4\u05d9\u05da, \u201cin order that the Torah of Hashem be in your mouth;\u201d in that verse the letter \u05d0 occurs twice to serve as a hint that two thousand of the 6000 years that the earth will function as we know it, will already be years in which G\u2019d\u2019s Torah will be studied by many people. [Seeing that the Jewish people began its existence with the birth of the first Jew who was a Jew at birth, Yitzchok, which occurred 400 years before the Exodus, and it is the Jewish people\u2019s task to study and spread the Torah, and Yitzchok\u2019s birth coincided almost exactly with the beginning of the third millennium, this may be why the author of this commentary chose that verse and the two letters \u05d0 in it, as another example of the letter \u05d0 being utilised as a symbol of Torah study. ", "1": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea, Rashi understands the letter \u05d1 at the beginning of this word to mean: \u201con account of, due to, because of the merit of;\u201d the word \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea, he understands as a reference to the Torah, which elsewhere has been called \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea. We also find that the Sabbath, the holy covenant, and the circumcision have been referred to by that name. The same is true of the word: \u05d0\u05e9, \u201cfire,\u201d which near the end of the Torah (Deuteronomy 33,2) has been referred to as the \u05d0\u05e9\u05d3\u05ea, \u201cfire converted into religious law.\u201d Rashi further quotes an interpretation by Rabbi Yitzchok, also found in an ancient version of Tanchuma, according to which, if the Torah were only a record of G\u2019d\u2019s laws, it need not have commenced before the 12th chapter of Exodus, where we encounter for the first time a law addressed to the entire people of Israel, i.e. the sanctification of the new moon, and the fact that we count the months of the year according to the moon\u2019s orbit. On the face of it that statement is difficult as such laws as circumcision for Jewish males, as well as the prohibition to eat the gid hanashe, the thigh vein of mammals, has been recorded alread prior to this. We must assume that the Tanchuma referred to legislation given to the people when they had become a nation, something that began with chapter 12 in Exodus. Rabbi Yitzchok basing himself on Tanchuma, argues that everything in the Torah recorded prior to chapter 12 in Exodus has as its purpose to defend the Jewish people against any claim that they had robbed the Canaanites of their land when they crossed the river Jordan."}, "1": "<b>\"let there be light\" and there was light:</b> And that which [the Torah] did not write, \"and it was so,\" as with the other [days] is because, when it did so with the others, it was written in order to shorten its words; since had it explained all the arrangements of creation, it would have had to have been more expansive, but here there is no more expansiveness in the word (and there was) light (<i>vayehi ohr</i>) than in the word, (and it was) so (<i>vayehi khen</i>). ", "2": "<b>And the earth brought forth grass, etc. according to its species:</b> In Tractate Chullin 60a, it interprets midrashically, \"that the grasses raised an a fortiori argument (<i>kal ve'chomer</i>) about themselves, etc., [and] the minister of the world opened and said, 'may the honor of God be forever.'\" And it is difficult according to the opinion that holds that Chanoch is [the same as] Metatron and that Metatron is [the same as] the minister of the world, since behold, at that time, Chanoch had not yet been created. And some explain, that there were [actually] two ministers of the world [and that here it is the other one, not Chanoch]. And we can also answer that [the understanding that the minister of the world reacted to the grasses here] is not like the opinion that holds that Chanoch is Metatron. And nonetheless, even according to [that opinion,] we can say, that it is true that [Chanoch] was not created, but his soul or 'constellation' was nonetheless created, [and] it said [what it did] about this verse; as we find (Avodah Zarah 5a) concerning 'the Book of the Generations (descendants) of man,' that we interpret midrashically, that [the mention of such a book in Genesis 5:1] teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed [Adam] each generation and its wise men - even though those generations were not [yet] created, nonetheless, He showed him their souls and their 'constellations.'", "3": "<b>the two great luminaries:</b> The explanation is that they are both great, nonetheless one is greater than its fellow, as it is written [concerning the sun], \"the great luminary.\" And the rabbis interpreted midrashically [that] in the beginning, they were created equally, but [when] the moon attacked [the sun], it was reduced; and the sun retained its great size, because it heard its abuse and didn't answer. Which is like we say (Yoma 23a), \"those that are insulted but do not insult, listen to their abuse and do not answer..., about them the verse is speaking [when it says] (Judges 5:31), 'and those that love Him are like the sun when it goes out in its strength,'\" [meaning that they are] like the sun that heard its abuse and didn't answer, and became great through it. And also in the <i>yotzer</i> [prayer] on Shabbat, some have the version, \"and He reduced the shape of the moon,\" and this is its explanation; God, may He be blessed, saw that it attacked [the sun] and He reduced it [to punish it for this]. And for those that have the version, \"He saw and formed [the shape of the moon], the explanation is this; God, may He be blessed, saw that in the future, the nations of the world would make the mistake of following the sun and making it into idol worship; [and so] He stood and formed the shape of the moon [after forming the sun], to show them that the sun is not a god; since, behold, there is another sun, fitting and fine [just] like it.", "4": {"0": "<b>And God blessed them:</b> And so [too] (Genesis 2:3), \"And God blessed the seventh day.\" Behold, you have learned [from this] that one who acquires a new thing should make the blessing of '<i>shehechianu</i>.'", "1": "<b>Be fruitful and multiply:</b> And mules were not included in [this] blessing, as we say (Genesis 36:24), \"he is Anah, who found the mules in the wilderness;\" and therefore, they do not reproduce and multiply in the world. And even according to Rabbi Yose - who concludes in Chapter <i>Makom She'nahagu</i>, that on the night after the first Shabbat, Adam brought two beasts and cross-breeded them, and from them came the mule - it is not difficult, [since] it had previously been said, \"be fruitful and multiply\" [and the mule had already been excluded]."}, "5": {"0": "<b>And conquer it:</b> [Using the variant spelling that is] missing [the letter] <i>vav</i>, to teach you that it is the way of the man to 'conquer' the female; so that she not be unbridled, to cause a stumbling block for sexual impropriety, as did Leah, when she accustomed her daughter [to be unbridled] and created a stumbling block [for her]. And any [woman] who secludes herself in her home is fitting to marry the High Priest, as it is stated (Psalms 45:14), \"All the honor of the king's daughter indoors, [is more than gold checkered clothing] etc,\" which means to say, that she will marry someone, about whom it is written (Exodus 28:39), \"and you shall make checkered [...].\" And she is fitting to have High Priests come from her, as it is stated (Psalms 128:3), \"your sons will be like olive plantings;\" meaning that they will be anointed with olive oil.", "1": "\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5, \u201cbe fruitful and multiply!\u201d this blessing did not include mules, as we know from the Torah\u2019s cryptic report that a certain man by the name of Anah had made horses and donkeys mate as a result of which a new species called mules came into being. (Genesis 36,24) (after having cross bred horses and she donkeys) \u201cthis is Anah who found the mules in the desert which had been the result of horses and asses being crossbred.\u201d This is the reason why mules do not reproduce their species. According to our sages, he did so, seeing that he himself was a bastard as related in the beginning of the same verse. He had slept with his mother. Even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yossi, in the Talmud tractate Pessachim folio 54, who claims that immediately after the first Sabbath Adam crossbred two mammals, as a resulted of which the species mules came into existence there is no inconsistency here as the blessing to be fruitful and to multiply had been given to man prior to the first Sabbath.", "2": " \u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05e9\u05d4, \u201cand subdue her;\u201d the missing letter \u05d5 which would signify the plural mode in that word, is to teach us that it is normal for the male to dominate the female in marital relations, she is to reside inside her home and not venture out without a suitable escort, as we know from Leah, Dinah\u2019s mother whose daughter was raped by Sh\u2019chem because she had been allowed to roam unescorted. Dinah\u2019s mother Leah, was also quoted elsewhere as having left her tent unescorted, (Genesis 30,16) [although she had apparently good reason on that occasion; Ed.] Psalms 45,14 teaches that a truly Royal princess finds her glory inside her home, not when on public display. [If Bat Sheva had not displayed her charms when bathing on the roof of her house where David saw this, many problems in Jewish history might have been prevented. Ed.] (Samuel II 11,3-4) According to tradition, any woman who strictly observes this rule of chastity is worthy of becoming the wife of a High priest. The sages derive this from the word: \u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05ea, (Exodus 28,39) which is interpreted as the High Priest adorning himself with his tunic, the \u201ctunic\u201d being his chaste wife. [The High Priest\u2019s tunic covered him from neck to toe. Ed.] Such a wife is apt to give birth to sons, who in turn will qualify as future High priests.(Midrash Tanchuma Tetzaveh, 6) Of her it is said (Psalms 128,3: \u2018your wife shall be like a fruitful vine \u00adwithin your house; your sons like olive saplings around your table.\u201d"}}, "1": ["\u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05dc\u05d5, \u201cthey had been completed;\u201d whence does the practice to recite this paragraph during kiddush while standing originate? It is because this paragraph is a testimony, and testimony must always be given while the witness is standing. (Compare Maimonides laws about testimony, chapter 9, halachah 7 stating that minors are not acceptable as witnesses as it is required that two men, i.e. adults, stand when testifying,\u201d i.e. \u05d5\u05e2\u05de\u05d3\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthe two adult witnesses shall be standing, etc.\u201d) (Deut 19,17). We are taught further in the Talmud tractate Shabbat folio 119, that when a Jew returns home from the synagogue on Friday night, and he recites this paragraph, two angels will place their hands upon his head and bless him, saying: \u201cmay all your sins be removed from you, and may you enjoy complete atonement.\u201d If you were to ask where we can find this line in scripture? We refer you to Leviticus 5,8, where testimony is discussed, and the Torah condemns someone who knows of something that he is required to testify to, but refuses to give such testimony. It says there that by failing to give his testimony, he will have to bear his sin. It follows that testifying truthfully results in one\u2019s sins being removed. Giving testimony that the Lord has created the universe in six days concluding on Friday night, by reciting this paragraph while standing, is such testimony."], "2": {"0": "\u05d4\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05e5 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9\u05da \u05dc\u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05ea? \u201cDid you eat from the tree which I had commanded you not to eat from?\u201d [this is the plain meaning of that line.

As far as her delegating her physical chores to maidservants etc., was concerned, G\u2019d added that the pains associated with pregnancy were something that she could not delegate. She reasoned that at least the act of giving birth would then be a relief from such pain; G\u2019d disabused her of that also. She then reasoned that her hope lay in abstaining from marital intercourse and thus not become pregnant again. G\u2019d told her that she would undergo a psychological change by feeling desirous for marital intercourse with her husband. To the suggestion that she would control her urges for sexual release, G\u2019d retorted that her husband would force her to engage in marital relations with her.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d9\u05de\u05e9\u05dc \u05d1\u05da, \u201che shall rule over you.\u201d We find a statement in B\u2019reyshit Rabbah 20,7 by Rabbi Yossi Ha-g\u2019leelee, (the Galilean) according to which this statement is supposed to be restrictive, -i.e. the husband not having complete control of his wife; he bases himself on an interesting comparison between the upper and lower millstones in Deuteronomy 24,6. He views the prohibition of a lender taking both of these millstones as security for an overdue loan, and the previous verse ordering a husband to please his wife for a whole year after they get married, and the Torah describing taking both millstones as equivalent to robbing the lender of his life, \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, as proof that the husband\u2013wife relationship must at all times remain one in which the wife continues to love her husband to the point of seeking physical union with him. He adds that we know that a woman is compared to the lower of the two millstones by citing a verse from Job 31,10: \u05ea\u05d8\u05d7\u05df \u05d5\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9, \u201cmay my wife grind for another.\u201d According to the Talmud tractate Sotah, Judges 16,21, where Samson\u2019s suffering at the hands of the Philistines is described with the words: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d7\u05df \u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201che had to act as a grindstone in the jail,\u201d which Rabbi Yossi understands as a chore that a husband must not impose on his wife, even so he is described as \u201cruling over her.\u201d The Jerusalem Talmud interprets Deut. 24,6 as referring to anything that is a basic necessity for a person\u2019s economic survival as being prohibited to be taken as a pledge, a millstone serving as an example of such necessities. The Jerusalem Targum also considers letting a woman to whom one is betrothed to be married wait for more than a year before the wedding is performed as a violation of the commandment discussed in this verse."}, "2": "\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05da, \u201cthe earth will henceforth be cursed on your account.\u201d [Seeing that the expression \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 is usually understood as introducing a positive result, our author wanted to justify its use here. Ed.] He understands the earth being cursed as the result of Adam not having been able to resist his powerful craving to taste the forbidden fruit. He cites the use of the expression \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 as being used in a similar sense when the Israelites for the first time, instead of eating bread that descended from heaven. i.e. manna, eating bread that had originated from earth, something that they had on occasion longed for even in the desert. (Numbers chapter 11 and 21) Compare Joshua 8,11-12 where the Israelites eating normally grown food is described as \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, according to our author as something they craved as having grown from the earth. The fact that G\u2019d tells Adam that the earth will bring forth thorns and thistles instead of \u201cbread,\u201d shows that the punishment fits the crime, as thorns and thistles are certainly not what Adam craves in response to his working the soil.", "3": "\u05d1\u05d6\u05e2\u05ea \u05d0\u05e4\u05da, by the sweat of your brow;\u201d Rabbi Yehudah hachassid draws our attention to the fact that this curse is one that affects only farmers who physically till the earth, but not people of a different vocation, especially the socially higher ranking people.

We must therefore view this verse as telling us that by dint of his offering Hevel acquired a share in afterlife. [The concept of afterlife was new, as his father having introduced mortality of human beings through his sin had not yet done anything to at least acquire an afterlife.

(verse 6-7) He made it plain to his brother that he was very upset that G\u2019d had not seen fit to accept his offering as He had done with Hevel\u2019s offering. Hevel reacted to G\u2019d having criticised Kayin with joy. When Kayin saw that his brother had been glad that he had been criticised by G\u2019d, he arose with the intent of killing him. (second half of this verse). His motive was plain jealousy. Our author cites an additional or different interpretation of the incomplete sentence: \u201cKayin said to his brother Hevel,\u201d which he had heard in the name of Rabbi Yossi Karo (turn of 11th 12 the century, not to be confused with Joseph Karo author of Shulchan Aruch, of Safed who lived during the most of the 16th century). that initially Hevel, having heard from Kayin what G\u2019d had said to him, was afraid of him seeing that his brother was so angry, and remained on guard against him. When Kayin told him that G\u2019d had held out hope for him by promising that He would relate to him with fondness if he changed his ways, Hevel dropped his guard feeling certain that Kayin would indeed change his ways. When Kayin spoke to him in a friendly mien, i.e. \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8, he thought that this was proof that Kayin had changed.

This is why Lemech who held himself as guilty of killing Kayin, even though he did so unintentionally, told his wives what would happen to anyone killing him on that account (Compare verse 25 in this chapter.) Lemech\u2019s children were the seventh generation, after Adam. (Adam-Kayin-Chanoch-Irod-M\u2019chuyael-M\u2019tushael-Lemech-(Yaval,Yuval Tuval Kayin) He told his wives that the whole generation of such a killer fathered by himself would be held responsible for his murder by G\u2019d, seeing that what he had done was due to his being blind and therefore totally innocent of any intent to harm a human being.", "3": " \u05d5\u05e9\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05e6\u05dc\u05d4, \u201cand the name of his (Lemech\u2019s) second wife was Tzilah.\u201d According to Rashi, it had become a custom for men to marry two wives, one for child-bearing and one for co-habitation, (indulging one\u2019s libido). The second type of wife would drink a potion which would prevent her from becoming pregnant as a result of having sexual relations. The Torah telling us about Tzilah giving birth to a son, is to inform us that something went awry, [perhaps she only pretended to drink that potion, Ed.] Our author questions this as the Torah reported simply that Tzilah also gave birth, without hinting that this was unusual. We must assume therefore that the explanation of Rashi is based on the unnecessary word \u05d2\u05dd, \u201calso,\u201d in our verse, as having born children would have been something completely normal.", "4": " '\u05d0\u05d6 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d7\u05dc \u05dc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e9\u05dd \u05d4, \u201cthen men began to abuse the name of the Lord, (by applying it to idols).\u201d According to our author the meaning is that men began to swear false oaths using the name of the Lord to appear believable. The word \u05d4\u05d5\u05d7\u05dc is seen as analogous to Numbers 30,3: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5, \u201che must not desecrate his word\u201d (when swearing an oath)."}, "4": {"0": "\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd, \u201cthis is the book of the history of mankind.\u201d G\u2019d even gave Adam an outline of the family trees of future generations.

In Torat Kohanim Rabbi Akiva is quoted as saying that that verse teaches us \u201ca great rule, an all inclusive concept,\u201d (a variation of Hillel who summed up the essence of Judaism as don\u2019t do to others what you would not have do them to you.) Ben Azzai understands the words as applying to the end of the verse, i.e. \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4', \u201cI am the Lord,\u201d a reminder that all human beings have been created in the image of the Lord, so that no race can feel superior to another race, [regardless of the colour of their skin. Ed.] He applies the verse even to people who due to their humility have a low esteem of their own value as not being allowed to forget that we are all descended from the same origin. Everyone must respect his fellow man\u2019s dignity and honour, regardless of how unassuming he himself happens to be. He must look at the likeness of his fellow man seeing that he cannot look at himself objectively. [We are not speaking of mirror images.

An alternate interpretation. Metushelach, Noach\u2019s grandfather, a G\u2019d fearing person, advised his son Lemech not to name his firstborn son immediately after he was born, as all the other people of that time were idolaters and sorcerers, and if they had known why his father had called him Noach they would have tried to harm him had they known his name, by applying their sorcerers\u2019 formulas."}, "5": {"0": {"0": " \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05df \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u201cMy spirit will not rule within man forever;\u201d this is a metaphor describing G\u2019d as withholding man\u2019s souls from participating in an afterlife after they had returned for Divine judgment.

The expression used by the Torah according to Rashi to illustrate this is therefore \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05d9, \u201cdissolution,\u201d instead of other words for destruction such as \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d3\u05d4 or \u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4.", "3": {"0": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea \u05e0\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d7, \u201cthese are the generations of Noach, Noach;\u201d why has the name of Noach been repeated here twice? He was exemplary vis a vis spiritual beings in the heavenly spheres as well as vis a vis his contemporaries on earth. (B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 30,4) The meaning is to tell us that whenever we encounter such a construction of a person\u2019s name appearing twice in a row, it is to remind us that the person concerned was a righteous person. An example for this is found in Genesis 2,11, where the name Avraham appears twice in a row. This interpretation has been challenged in the Jerusalem Talmud where it is pointed out that we find the same repetition of a man\u2019s name applied to Avraham\u2019s father Terach, a renowned idolater and seller of heathen images (Genesis 11,27) The answer provided by B\u2019reshit Rabbah is that Terach, though an idolater had become a penitent. It is this very fact that convinced our sages that he had become a penitent before his death. This also explains why Avraham was told by G\u2019d in Genesis 15,15, that he would join his fathers in the hereafter.", "1": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9, \u201ca man;\u201d The author of Midrash Tanchuma (2) on this parshah, commences this paragraph with a quotation from Proverbs 11,30: \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7 \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d7 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05db\u05dd, usually translated as \u201cthe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, a wise man captivates people.\u201d According to Tanchuma, the meaning of Solomon there was to tell us that if someone dies without leaving behind children to posterity this is a disgrace and he bewails his fate. G\u2019d in this case, when the departed person had been a righteous person, consoles him by telling him that the Torah he had studied while on earth will be considered by Him as his fruit. This is why the verse speaks of \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u201ca tree of life,\u201d instead of referring to the righteous person\u2019s sons that he left behind. The Torah has been referred to as \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd in Proverbs 3,18. Our sages relate that Noach did not die until he saw the earth having become settled by man and until all the seventy nations resulting from his loins be it directly or indirectly had become earth\u2019s civilisation (after the destruction of the Tower) Of all the righteous people mentioned in the Bible the only one who was ever referred to as a \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, \u201ca perfectly righteous human being\u201d Noach is the only one complimented in such a fashion. According to a statement in B\u2019reshit Rabbah 30,8 anyone of whom the Torah ever used the adjective \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, perfect, concluded his life after a multiple of seven years. [Just as a sh\u2019mittah cycle is unit of seven years. Ed.] Rabbi Yitzchok son of Avraham, points out that this cannot be true as both Avraham and Noach to whom these attributes were applied died at 175 years and 950 years, both not multiples of seven. The Rabbi\u2019s words therefore must be understood as multiples commencing with when the attribute \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05dd was applied to the persons concerned; in the case of Noach he had acquired that title when he was commanded to build the ark, 120 years before the deluge commenced. Since he survived after that for the 350 years we get a total of 470 years, from which we need to deduct the year he spent in the ark, -not really a year of life- and we have a multiple of seven year cycles, i.e. 67 times 7 equals 469. Avraham had been 99 years of age when he had another 77 years to live.", "2": "\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4, \u201che was;\u201d whenever this expression is used in connection with a person, it implies that he saw a new world, i.e. he became privy to entirely new perspectives in his life. Noach certainly experienced a new world, and Joseph of whom the same word is used became the person responsible for saving the whole nation of Egypt from perishing by hunger. Moses had a similar experience, (Exodus 3,1 at the burning bush) so did Job (Job 1,1) when becoming subjected to sudden and terrible trials to test his faith in the Lord."}, "4": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05de\u05d4 \u05ea\u05db\u05dc\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4, \u201cand finish it to within a cubit from the top;\u201d this was meant to prevent the rains from getting into the ark and causing its planks to rot. If you were to argue that the rains then could cause the width of the ark to start rotting, we refer you to the commentary of Rabbi Yossi Karo, who understands the subject in the verse to be the window. This window should be affixed in the upper cubit near the roof, the cover of the ark.", "5": "\u05d5\u05de\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9....\u05ea\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, \u201cand bring from all living species, etc.\u201d According to Rashi the wording includes species of demons. In B\u2019reshit Rabbah 31,13 Rabbi Aushiyah claims that the oblique wording of the Torah was exploited by disembodied spirits to demand entrance to the ARK. Noach refused them entry until they could appear with their partners. He used the fact that the Torah added the words \u05de\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8, \u201cfrom all that is flesh,\u201d to deny entrance. Another version is that \u201cLie\u201d begged for entry into the ark. When Noach heard this he demanded that \u201cLie\u201d come with its partner. \u201cLie\u201d chose the spiritual representative of all thieves as his partner. When this arch thief asked \u201cLie\u201d what it would give him for appearing before Noach as its mate, \u201cLie\u201d answered that it would give him everything it acquired through falsehood. They therefore entered the ark side by side. This is the origin of the well known proverb: \u201cwhatever is sown by falsehood is reaped by thievery.\u201d A different version quotes Noach as tying that pair to the outside of the ark without permitting it to enter it. [Rashi, i.e. the author of the Midrash, was probably forced to give such an interpretation as we might have thought that if all living creatures died except for Noach and his family, how come there was still falsehood and thievery on earth even after the deluge. Ed.]"}, "6": {"0": "\u05de\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d1\u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, \u201cfrom all of the ritually pure domestic animals;\u201d seeing that the Torah had not been given yet, and therefore there were no ritually impure domestic animals or creatures, Rashi understands the expression as referring to the domestic animals that would in the future be described as being ritually pure. We therefore learn that Noach had already studied Torah laws which had not yet been revealed publicly (B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 40, based on Psalms 1,2) If so, why did the Talmud in tractate Zevachim folio 116 have to pose the question of how Noach knew, and to answer that the ritually pure animals came to the ark on their own, whereas Noach had to round up the others in order to bring them into the ark? According to the Talmud, Noach only recognised ritually pure animals after the event, not because he had learned the physical signs described in the Torah. <br> There is a third opinion according to which it became clear which animals had been ritually pure only after Noach offered some of these as offerings after having left the ark. This interpretation is also not logical as G\u2019d had commanded him prior to entering the ark to take seven pairs each of the ritually pure animals into the ark, so that he must have known beforehand which animals to take. This is also what Rashi commented on chapter 8, verse 20. He had realised that the only reason he had been commanded to take seven pairs of the species concerned was in order to have these animals available after the deluge to serves as sacrifices. It would appear therefore that the statement that Noach had studied the Torah, must have referred to the instructions to take such ritually pure birds, (6,4) something which became clear to him when noting that these birds were monogamous, mating only with the same female. When he saw that the ark accepted more than one pair of certain animals, it became clear to him that the extra specimens must have been meant to serve as sacrifices as G\u2019d considered them as ritually pure. \u201cStudying Torah,\u201d as mentioned by Rashi, must mean therefore that he learned Torah by keeping his eyes open and drawing the right conclusions. He had also noted that these animals had only kept company with members of their own species during the long months in the ark. This is most likely also the reason why, when the Torah wrote the details about the laws of chastity and forbidden sexual intercourse in Leviticus 18,23-24, it stated that Jews must not defile themselves through such animals.\n", "1": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cwhen the deluge covered the earth with water.\u201d There is good reason to ask why G\u2019d chose the deluge as the instrument with which to punish mankind, rather than any other means at His disposal. Our sages in the Talmud tractate Rosh Hashanah folio 12 answered this question by stating that this method was chosen as it conformed to the principle of making the punishment match the sin. Man had sinned by means of boiling water, (metaphor for extremely serious sins, involving sexual emissions that are considered as the result of the body becoming heated) so G\u2019d chose equally severe measures as the means to punish them by. The subject has been illustrated by a parable in which a king magnanimously set aside a section of a city to serve as residence for blind people, and he provided them with all comforts in order to make their lives more tolerable. Whenever the king passed this way, the blind people would rise and shout in gratitude for the king\u2019s generosity. Once the king heard their voices and enquired from his entourage who was the source of this shouting. He was told that it originated with the blind people whom he so lavishly supported. They added that the blind people do the same whenever they hear horses galloping in their neighbourhood. He responded by saying: \u201chow much louder would be their shouting if they were able to see their benefactor with their own eyes.\u201d He therefore commanded to return these blind people to their former locations, and to install people with eyesight in the section formerly reserved for the blind. He ordered that the new residents be provided with all that he had formerly provided the blind with. When these people now realised that they had been promoted, they lived it up. Instead of being grateful, whenever the king passed in their area they raised their voices cursing him for having forced them to relocate. When the king was told about this, he decided to execute all these people.<br> The point of the parable is that originally the universe having been in chaos, was transformed into water, i.e. an element that is both blind and deaf. Even though, the waters praised the Lord for having thus raised their status. We know this from Psalms 93,3: \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4', \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u201cthe oceans sound o Lord, the oceans sound their thunder, the ocean sounds its pounding.\u201d When the Lord heard this, He ordered the oceans which had covered the surface of the earth to be relocated so as to provide room for the earth to emerge and be seen. (Genesis 1.9) He created man in order to inhabit that earth, where previously there had only been water, providing man with fruit-bearing trees and all kinds of other luxuries, expecting, of course, to be rewarded with man\u2019s expression of appreciation. The earth was so good that it required to be tilled only once in forty years. Instead, man took his good fortune for granted and instead of accepting the rules laid down by the Creator, rebelled against Him. When the Lord became aware of this, He had no choice but to punish them for their ingratitude. He commanded the waters to return to their original areas, allocated them at the beginning of creation.

(as the first night no rain had fallen) The Torah had made a point of writing in verse 11: \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d1\u05e7\u05e2\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05d4\u05d5\u05dd, \u201con this day all the fountains of the deep broke open.\u201d Accordingly the 40 days came to an end on the 28th day of Kislev.\u201d This does not seem accurate, seeing that he himself wrote on verse 24, where the Torah wrote that the water level on earth kept increasing for a period of one hundred and fifty days which would mean that they kept increasing until the first day of Sivan where the Torah spoke about the seventh month as the day when the rains stopped descending. (compare his commentary on 8,4) We would therefore have to include the first day of the \u201cforty\u201d days as being part of that count. I believe therefore that the rains had started falling as soon as it was daylight on the seventeenth of the second month, as the words: \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 in our verse do not prove anything about which part of the day it refers to. We find this expression in the Torah on numerous occasions when it clearly includes the preceding night. (The author quotes Genesis 2,2, and Leviticus 23,28 as examples to prove his point.) The author also cites Seder Olam, an ancient history text, as supporting his conclusion. He quotes that text verbatim: \u201con this day all the fissures in the earth broke open, and rain fell on the earth from the sky. This state of affairs continued until the 27th day of Kislev, but the level of water covering the surface of the earth continued to rise until the end of 150 days, that day being the first day of the month of Sivan.\u201d In light of what the author of that text writes, we must include the first day of the \u201cforty\u201d days given in the Torah in our total.\n", "4": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d0\u05da \u05e0\u05d7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4, \u201cthere survived only Noach and the people and animals with him in the ark.\u201d According to a quote attributed to Rabbi Yehudah hachasid, this wording contains a hint that the giant Og, later known as the king of Bashan, survived the deluge, the letters in the words: \u05d0\u05da \u05e0\u05d7 in our verse, which are unnecessary, have the same numerical value as the letters in the or \u05e2\u05d5\u05d2, (79)"}, "7": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cG\u2019d made wind pass over the earth;\u201d this was the same wind of which the Torah in Genesis 1,2 had written that it was \u201chovering\u201d over the surface of the waters.

The ark came to rest in the seventh month, the month of Sivan, counting from the month of Kislev which was the month during which the rains had ceased descending. The \u201cseventh\u201d month here could not have been the seventh month after the rains began to descend, as that would have been Iyar, seeing that it had commenced during the second month of the year, i.e. during Marcheshvan. If we were to assume that the Torah referred to the seventh month after the rains had begun, a count of 40 days of rain falling, plus 150 days of the waters continuing to rise, this would bring us only to the 17th day in Iyar. Clearly, we must allow for days during which the waters had begun to recede, else how could the ark come to rest anywhere, seeing that the Torah told us that at its highest, the waters were 15 cubits above the highest peaks on earth? If we accept our interpretation the ark would have come to rest on Arrarat on the sixteenth day after having risen to its highest level. That date had been in the tenth Av, not Ellul. When the Torah, in verse 5, speaks of the tenth month, on the tenth of which the highest peaks became visible once more. According to Rashi\u2019s calculation forty days elapsed (verse 6) elapsed before Noach for the first time lifted the window at the top of the ark to dispatch the raven on its mission, which it did not really carry out. Apparently sixty days passed between the time when the highest peaks became visible until the surface of the earth was no longer covered with water. If we were to assume that the highest peaks had not become visible until the month of Ellul (the tenth month when commencing with Marcheshvan when the rains first descended) we would therefore have to conclude that the waters subsided at a rate of one cubit per four days, 15 cubits during the 60 days commencing with the highest peaks having become visible again. According to this calculation, the bottom of the ark had been in eleven cubits of water at one stage at least.<br> According to Rashi\u2019s calculation we face the following problem: if as the Torah writes, (verse 6) Noach opened the window of the ark after forty days of it having come to rest on Arrarat and he sent the pigeon out more that 40 days after the ark had come to rest, how come that the pigeon did not find any place to park on? It surely should have been able to rest on some mountains slightly lower than Arrarat which was near there? Rashi was aware of this problem, and this is why he wrote on verse 6 that the highest peaks had become visible. According to my understanding we must assume that the mountain range of Arrarat at the time was not above the tree line, and that the tops of these trees were visible even earlier that the peaks themselves. Accordingly, we must understand the whole period as follows: the water level on earth began to recede after having constantly risen for 150 days. These days had come to an end on the first day of Sivan. On the seventeenth of that month the ark ran aground. Forty days after continuing receding of the water levels, Noach opened the window of the ark, i.e. on the tenth day of Tammuz. He immediately dispatched the raven. When after seven days the raven had not performed his mission, he sent out a pigeon. This was on the 17th day of Tammuz. The pigeon returned not having a place where to rest its feet. I venture to add on my own that we see an allusion to the dates of the beginning of the eventual destruction of the Temple which began on the seventeenth of Tammuz when the wall of Jerusalem was breached by the Romans. Israel- also known lovingly as \u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4, pigeon, (Song of Songs 2,14) has never again found rest historically since that date when Noach\u2019s pigeon could not find rest. Noach then waited another seven days to send out the pigeon again, and on that occasion it returned with a torn olive leaf in its beak, signaling that the earth was on the way to becoming normal again. This occurred in the month of Av, on the first of the month when the receding of the waters had come to an end. The next time the pigeon never returned having found it possible to live in freedom outside the confinements of the ark, seeing that the tops of the trees had become visible. This completed the 60 days it took from when the tips of the mountains to become visible as Rashi had stated. The month of Av was the tenth month, counting from when the rains first stated descending. All this is in accordance with what the Torah reported when it wrote that on the first day of the first month of the following year, the surface of the earth had become dry [though too soft to walk on without sinking into the ground. Ed.] I have found that Seder Olam, chapter 4 agrees with my explanation though it is worded differently. However, I find it difficult to understand that if as Rashi assumes the tops of the trees became visible before the peaks themselves had become visible why did the Torah write about the tops of the peaks being visible, instead of writing about the tops of the trees on them becoming visible? Even if we were to assume that only olive trees survived the deluge until that time as a result of what is written in verse 23, something that might be understood as the result of Rashi\u2019s comment on that verse, [I fail to see how; Ed.] our author, bases himself on the tradition that Noach must have taken branches of fruit trees into the ark, else how could he have planted a vineyard, this was as he did not assume that any trees would survive. If indeed a single tree survived, the day on which this became evident was hardly worth a special mention. Regardless of all this, why would only the olive tree be the one surviving the deluge? If you were to answer that this was because in the future this tree and its fruit would be a basic necessity for the Jewish people in the Temple service, the same argument would be true also of the vines in the vineyard, whose fruit featured equally in the Temple service; so why did Noach have to take a branch with him into the ark instead of relying on some vines to survive the deluge? We would have to answer that the fruit of the vine was sufficient for Noach as a sample with which to start a vineyard, whereas a branch of an olive tree would dry out during the year in the ark so that it could not be revived when Noach came out of the ark.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 \u05d1\u05e4\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cand behold, it had a sprouting olive leaf in its beak.\u201d The word \u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 in this sense also occurs in Ezekiel 17,9 i.e. \u05db\u05dc \u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e6\u05de\u05d7\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05e9, \u201call its sprouting leaves may wither.\u201d [The normal translation of the word \u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 is familiar to us from Genesis 37,33, where Yaakov used it when confronted with the bloodied shreds of his son Joseph, is \u201ctorn.\u201d Presumably, the author felt that if that was the meaning of the word here, it would have been unnecessary, as how else could the pigeon have gotten hold of it.

B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 34,13, explains the need for this verse as being that we might think that when Chananyah, Mishael and Azaryah, (Daniel chapter 3 where their Babylonian names are used) agreed to be thrown into a fiery pit, clearly committing suicide, albeit as an act of sanctifying the name of the Lord, this was forbidden also. The reason that this verse was introduced by the word: \u05d0\u05da, was to exclude such suicides, even that of King Sha-ul, who did not want to give the Philistines the satisfaction of having killed a king who had been crowed with the approval of the Lord. (Samuel I 31,4) In both of these instances the victims did not execute themselves but were executed or meant to be executed by someone else. Committing suicide with one\u2019s own hands is an absolute no no. According to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon bar Avraham, also known as \u05d0\u05d5\u05db\u05de\u05df, the Rabbis did not make allowances for what King Sha-ul had done. There is a true story of a Rabbi, who at the time of persecutions of Jews practicing their faith, personally killed many young Jewish children in order to forestall the Christians from raising them in the Christian faith. One of Rabbinical colleagues was very angry at that Rabbi on that account, referring to him as a murderer. The first Rabbi did not heed the second Rabbi\u2019s warning not to become a murderer. Thereupon the Rabbi opposed to killing the infants said that if he had been right, his colleague would die a violent and painful death. Not only did the gentiles seize and kill that Rabbi-(who had killed the infants), but they stripped off his skin and placed sand between it and his flesh. Shortly thereafter, the decree forbidding the Jews to practice their faith was cancelled. If the first Rabbi had not killed all the infants, they would have been saved when the decree was cancelled.", "1": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 (\u05e0\u05d7) \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05db\u05e0\u05e2\u05df, \u201cNoach said: \u201cCanaan be cursed and become a lowly slave to his brothers\" Our sages in B\u2019reshit Rabbah 36,7 state that already when Noach entered the ark, he had been upset that he did not have a young son who could perform for him many chores that it had now become his task to perform personally. He therefore had resolved that when he would sire more children after leaving the ark, he would train some as his servants. Upon hearing him say something of that nature, his grandson Canaan went ahead and castrated him to prevent him from having more children. Noach therefore decided to treat Canaan as if he had been his fourth son and decreed that he should become a servant to his brothers. If you were to ask why he cursed Canaan more than anyone of Cham\u2019s other children, a question which is justified according to the opinion that it had been Canaan who had castrated him, [Canaan could not have been even one year old when Noach left the ark, so that Noach must have failed to impregnate with wife until he had grown up, Ed.] how do we answer the problem according to the opinion that it was his son Cham, and not his grandson who had castrated him? A sage by the name of Rabbi Aaron, found a Midrash that Cham had discovered his father in a state of nudity, and told his brothers about it in a derogatory manner, and he had been overheard by Canaan, who had decided to castrate his grandfather. This is the meaning of the puzzling words: \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05df, \u201cwhat his son the minor had done to him\u201d (9,24) Grandchildren are often referred to in the Torah as if they were children, not grandchildren. Actually, the line could not have referred to Cham, as he was not Noach\u2019s youngest son, as the Torah lists him as his middle son. (10,1) The Torah, in referring to Canaan as Noach\u2019s youngest son, meant his grandson. [At that time he only had one grandson, so that he did not have to be named. Ed.] We find proof that grandsons may be called younger sons in Ovadiah: 1,2: \u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05df \u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9\u05da \u05d1\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd, \u201chere I will make you the least among the nations;\u201dFurthermore, according to Pirkey de rabbi Eliezer, chapter 23, the line in Malachi 1,6: \u05d1\u05df \u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d1  \u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5, \u201ca son is expected to honour his father, and a servant his master,\u201d is interpreted as follows: when a son honours his father, all is well; if not, he will wind up as a servant to his master. [not found in my edition of the Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer. Ed.] An alternate interpretation. The reason why Noach chose as punishment that the person who witnessed his disgrace become a slave was that seeing he was the one who saw his state of nudity first, it was his duty to do what any servant would to, i.e. to cover his nudity. Seeing that he had neglected to perform the duty of a servant, he was now condemned to remain a servant all the time. This is also why he used the expression \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, \u201ca servant of servants,\u201d instead of simply \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 \u201cservant.\u201d Both Cham and his son Canaan were condemned to be servants to Cham\u2019s brothers.", "1": "\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, \u201ca slave for evermore.\u201d What caused him this terrible curse? It was all because he had shamed his father. As a punishment, in future his descendants would be put to shame, as we know from Isaiah 20,4: \u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05dc\u05da \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05e3 \u05e9\u05dc\u05e9 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e4\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05d5\u05e9, \u201cjust as My servant Yeshayahu had to go naked and barefoot, the captives of Egypt and the slaves of Nubia young and old will have to go naked and barefoot.\u201d But Yephet who honoured his father will be honoured by G\u2019d in the days of the wars preceding the final redemption when G\u2019d will reward him by humbling Gog and Magog, and by covering the shame of Yephet. (Compare Ezekiel 39,11).\u201d He will also compensate Shem, at the time when the two priests, sons of Aaron, prepared to offer their unauthorised incense in the Temple, when only their souls were burned, but their bodies as well as their garments were left intact by the heavenly fire and were buried in a dignified manner.

This is the reason why, when wanting to transfer this power to bless to his son Yitzchok, when he foresaw prophetically that Yitzchok would sire an Esau, Avraham could not bring himself to transfer this power to Yitzchok before he died, and he left it to G\u2019d to decide if that power were to be transferred to him. This is why we read in Genesis 25,11, that after Avraham had died G\u2019d bestowed this power on his son Yitzchok. The matter can be illustrated by a parable. A king owned a valuable orchard which he entrusted to one of his intimate friends to look after, and to irrigate properly. The friend began to undertake his task and found that there were two trees, one of which laden with a fruit containing a deadly poison, the other with an elixir of life. Both trees needed to be irrigated, but he found that the two trees were positioned in such a way that it was impossible to irrigate the one without at the same time also irrigating the other. He said to himself that if he irrigated the beneficial tree, he would simultaneously also prolong the existence of the poisonous tree. How was he to resolve this dilemma? He therefore resolved to leave well enough alone until the next time the owner of the orchard would visit it, when he could consult with him. At that time, he would follow the owner\u2019s instructions. Another interpretation of the words: \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4. This is not so much to be understood as a blessing itself, but as a command to become the source of blessings. Wherever his journeys would take him, he was to make it his concern to spread the knowledge about his Creator and to bless the person with whom he came into contact. This is also what Avraham did, as we know from Genesis 12,8; \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e9\u05dd \u05d4', \u201cHe proclaimed the Name of the Lord,\u201d (praising Him).

According to our tradition it took place 30 years before the birth of Yitzchok, and this is what the statement that the Israelites spent 430 years in Egypt, reported in Exodus 12,40 is based on. We know as a fact from the Torah that Avraham was one hundred years old when Yitzchok was born. According to Rashi, thirty years elapsed between the covenant of the pieces and the birth of Yitzchok. If so, Avraham could not have been more than 70 years old at that event. Lot joined him and was taken captive after having separated from Avraham during that same year still, and Avraham defeated the armies which had taken him captive, after which event G\u2019d appeared to him as reported in chapter 15. He returned to Charan once more, and when he was 75 years old, G\u2019d commanded him to move to the land of Canaan, i.e. \u201cthe land which I will show you.\u201d (12,1) I have found confirmation of these dates in the book called Seder Olam, an ancient historical record, considered reliable by our sages. I am quoting verbatim from that text: \u201cAvraham was 48 years old when G\u2019d confused the languages of the people and they moved apart from one another. When G\u2019d spoke to him at the covenant of the pieces, he was 70 years old. (this was while he was on the soil of the land of Canaan). He returned to Charan where he stayed for another five years. It follows that 27 years elapsed between the destruction of the Tower and Avraham\u2019s departure from Charan a second time\u201d Our verse refers to the second departure.\n", "3": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05db\u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d6 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cand the Canaanites were in the land at that time.\u201d Rashi interprets these words as meaning that at that period the Canaanites were in the process of capturing that land from the descendants of Shem whose king had ruled there in Jerusalem, then known as Shalem. It had been allocated to him by his father Noach. The difficulty with Rashi\u2019s interpretation is that Rashi, when commenting on Hebron in Numbers 13,22, states that Hebron had been founded seven years earlier that Tzoan of Egypt. We know Cham had given that city (Chevron) to his oldest son [Kush and Mitzrayim having been twins? Compare table in Chronicles of Mossad Harav Kook Ed.]. It follows that Canaanites must have been in that land already long before Avraham came to it. This is also the conclusion in the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 34. We must therefore assume that the details of this subject are the subject of a disagreement of the sages, and that Rashi was forced to side with one side, and chose this without mentioning that there is another opinion. [In the commentary of Haketav vehakabalah by Rabbi Mecklenburg, translated by this editor, the word \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 in Numbers 13,22, is not understood as a number but as a reference to something superior, and the observation that fathers often treat younger sons with more affection than they have for the firstborn. According to the Bible, Canaan was Cham\u2019s youngest son; (although that raises the question why Noach cursed him, instead of Cham\u2019s eldest son) Ed. It is interesting that the Canaanites were allowed to exist without retribution by G\u2019d for 47 years longer than the Egyptians, 7 years although they had been founded sooner, and 40 years because the first generation of Israelites had forfeited their right to inherit the land of Canaan as the result of the spies having badmouthed the land claiming that it devoured its inhabitants, and anyway could not be conquered by them. They were granted this extension because they agreed to have Avraham\u2019s wife Sarah buried in Chevron.\n", "4": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d4, \u201che pitched his tent;\u201d Rashi already comments on the peculiarity of the word \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d4, being spelled with the letter \u05d4 at the end, when the pronoun ending for \u201chis\u201d should have been the letter \u05d5. He gives as the reason that the Torah wished us to know that Avraham pitched his wife\u2019s tent before he pitched his own. (based on B\u2019reshit Rabbah). This raises the question why the same word is similarly misspelled in Genesis 9,21 when the subject was Noach\u2019s tent? What are we to deduce from that? We may answer that the reason why the Israelites of the Kingdom of Jerobam, i.e. the ten tribes who had seceded from the Kingdom of David, were exiled, shortly after Solomon had died? According to tradition as spelled out in the Book of prophets, the decree to exile them was sealed because they indulged in debauchery caused by indulging in too much wine too many times. Noach having become too drunk occurred in his wife\u2019s tent, or near its entrance. (Compare Amos 6,6, on the subject of these tribes\u2019 drunkenness) Compare also Ezekiel 23,4: where the word \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05de\u05d4 for the capital of that kingdom which had really been Shomron, was changed to indicate that G\u2019d had no place in that kingdom and in its rulers\u2019 considerations. Both the word \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d4 and \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05de\u05d4 are used by the prophet to describe the disloyal Jews in each kingdom. [The reader is referred to the commentary by Rabbi M. Eiseman in the Art Scroll edition of the Book of Ezekiel, even Jerusalem\u2018s name being changed in that chapter, as except during the reign of King Chizkiyahu things were not much better in the Kingdom of Yehudah. Ed.]", "5": "\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e4\u05ea \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea, \u201cI am well aware that you are a physically attractive woman;\u201d according to the interpretation of Rabbi Yossi Karo, the Torah abbreviated what Avraham said to Sarah, the full sentence including what is reported here as a separate sentence: \u201cI know that because you are a beautiful \u2013white skinned \u2013 woman as soon as they see you they will kill me and take you to the king\u2019s palace to be part of his harem. In order to save my life, say that you are my sister, instead of my wife.\u201d Although the Egyptians were idolaters, they observed the law of not sleeping with someone else\u2019s wife. As a result, they resorted to murder instead. This sounds strange, as the same lawgiver that prohibited adultery also prohibited murder. Their reasoning was-presumably, that it is better to murder and commit that sin once, than to commit the sin of adultery day after day. Besides, they were afraid that any husband, whose wife had been kidnapped, would complain to their respective kings about this. Once the original husband was dead, no restitution could be made."}, "12": {"0": "\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05da \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d0\u05dc\u05e1\u05e8, \u201cAryoch, king of Elassar.\u201d From this verse, i.e. the wording here, our sages decided that in a dispute between two major Talmudic scholars, Rav and Sh\u2019muel, when the subject concerns secular matters we rule in accordance with the opinion of Sh\u2019muel, whereas when the subject concerns ritual matters, matters regulating our direct relationship to G\u2019d.], we rule like Rav. (Compare Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 53.) Our sages describe Aryoch\u2019s real names as being \u201cSh\u2019muel, and the reason that he is called here Aryoch, is because the word is synonymous with being a monarch on earth, the secular part of the universe, whereas the name Elassar reminds us of the Hebrew word Issur, something forbidden by religious law. In other words: Aryoch arrogated to himself the right to give both secular and religious rulings on earth, treating earth as if G\u2019d had no say in this terrestrial part of the (His) universe.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8, \u201cthe one who had escaped (from the armies that captured Sodom and its satellites) came,\u201d (and reported on the battle to Avraham) It was the angel Michael who told Avraham. If so, why is he referred to as if a human being who had escaped from Sodom? [According to a comment in a book by Rabbi Reuven Margolies, called Malachey elyon, in which the names and functions of all the angels about whom we have some information are listed (131), Michael is an alternate name for Mattatron, often cited in kabalistic literature, as G\u2019d\u2019s \u201cgeneral manager\u201d in matters relating to earth,\u201d with especial concern for the Jewish people and their well wishers. Ed.] As to the reason why he is called by the strange name \u05e4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8, \u201crefugee, escapee,\u201d according to a tradition, when G\u2019d dispatched Samael and his forces to earth from heaven, Samael being another name for the perennial Satan, the latter tried to force Michael to go down to earth with him, and G\u2019d at the last moment took hold of his wing in order to keep him in the celestial spheres. Ever since then, the angel Michael has acquired the nickname \u05e4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8, \u201cescapee.\u201d Concerning this escapee, the prophet Ezekiel in Ezekiel 33,21, says: \u05d1\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8 \u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8, \u201cthe angel Michael came to me to inform me that Jerusalem had been conquered by the Babylonians.\u201d The prophet then is assigned a task by G\u2019d.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d7\u05e0\u05d9\u05db\u05d9\u05d5, \u201che mobilised all those whom he had trained;\u201d Avraham told all these men that they were about to go to war and if someone was afraid for his life due to sins he had committed, he was free to go back home. (Compare Deuteronomy 20,8) When they heard this, they all decided to return to their homes, with the exception of his loyal servant Eliezer. G\u2019d told Avraham not to worry and to let them go home, as He would empower Eliezer to possesss as much power as all these men had possessed combined. The numerical value of the letters in the name \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 total 318, and that is why the Torah described his \u201darmy\u201d as consisting of 318 men. (Compare Talmud, tractate Nedarim, folio 31) In addition, we have two interpretations of the Talmud scholars Rav and Sh\u2019muel, respectively, the former saying that the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7 in our verse refers to \u201cpouring words of Torah into these potential soldiers, whereas Sh\u2019muel says that he overcame their fears by giving them large quantities of gold. (same folio in the Talmud) His objective was to instill in these men the will to save as many lives as possible, not to fight for the sake of the loot they might capture by killing fellow human beings. [This editor has some difficulty with the explanations offered, as in verse 24 of our chapter Avraham insists that the men who had fought with him receive their share of the loot. Ed.]\n", "3": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3\u05e4\u05dd, \u201che smote them and put them to flight.\u201d Midrash Tanchuma asks: \u201cwho ever heard of soldiers pursuing dead people? How are we to understand this sequence in the verse?\u201d He therefore understands our verse as meaning that Avraham and his men pursued the soldiers of that army, and G\u2019d killed them.", "4": "\u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05e9\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d7\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05df, \u201cand Malki Tzedek, King of Shalem, produced bread and wine, etc.\u201d This was the custom in which soldiers returning from battle would be welcomed. They were naturally tired and worn out, and needed to replace spent energy by imbibing drink and consuming food. An alternate explanation: the reference to bread and wine, specifically, is a hint that just as that King was a priest, so priests of the Jewish people would perform temple service offering libations of wine and the showbreads to the Almighty on a regular basis. In this instance Malki Tzedek, up to now a priest of the supreme G\u2019d, forfeited that honour when he blessed Avraham before first blessing the Almighty, Who had enabled Avraham to become the victor. When David, in Psalms 110,4 said: \u05e0\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u05d4' \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e0\u05d7\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7, \u201cthe Lord has sworn and will not relent, \u2019you are a priest forever, a rightful priest by My decree,\u2019\u201d he referred to the incident in our verse which cost Malki Tzedek his priesthood. [All the people killed in that battle were actually killed by G\u2019d, as a priest who has killed a human being is forthwith denied the right to perform service in the Temple. Abraham certainly had represented the priesthood in his age. He was \u201cofficially\u201d appointed as such after this incident. Ed.] According to the Talmud in Nedarim 32, quoted earlier, this is all derived from the word \u05db\u05d4\u05df, \u201ca priest,\u201d which our sages understand to mean that his offspring were not priests."}, "13": {"0": {"0": "\u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05dd, \u201cdo not fear, Avraham.\u201d Having miraculously succeeded to kill these mighty kings and their armies, Avraham was now afraid that he used up his spiritual \u201ccapital\u201d i.e. any merits he might have accumulated by his good deeds thus far. G\u2019d now reassured him on that score, saying that he need not worry about that. On the contrary, if someone removes thorns from the paths of people, something that might have harmed them, he is doubly deserving of protection by Him. (Midrash Tanchuma section 10) This may well be why the sages composing the Amidah prayer referred to G\u2019d as \u201cshield of Avraham, at the conclusion of the first benediction.\u201d At the time when Yitzchok was lying bound on the altar his father had put him on Mount Moriah, his soul escaped to heaven only to return to him and to revive his body. This may account for the second benediction in the Amidah prayer concluding with G\u2019d being referred to as \u201creviving the dead.\u201d We find a statement in B\u2019reshit Rabbah 65,10, that the reason why Yitzchok\u2019s physical eyesight was dim after the experience on Mount Moriah, is due to the fact that he had had a glimpse of the essence of G\u2019d during his soul\u2019s brief stay there, and the Torah told us, i.e. Moses was told by G\u2019d (Exodus 33,20) that a visual image of the essence of G\u2019d is denied human beings while they are still alive.", "1": "When Yaakov, in his dream of the ladder, observed the angels ascending and descending from heaven and accompanying him at all times, while constantly singing the praises of the Lord, this may be the reason why the third benediction, symbolising Yaakov, ends with G\u2019d being described as \u201cthe holy G\u2019d.\u201d"}, "1": "\u05db\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d6\u05e8\u05e2\u05da, \u201cso shall be your seed.\u201d Rabbi Tanchuma son of Acha, basing himself on this phrase, commented that it is an assurance that there will never be fewer than 30 righteous people on earth at all times. He uses the word \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cwill be (singular),\u201d as his proof. [The numerical value of the combined letters in that word is 30. Ed.]", "2": "\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d3\u05de\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05dd, \u201cand a deep darkness (sleep) had fallen upon Avraham. During this sleep G\u2019d showed Avraham that his descendants would endure the enslavement to several kingdoms at different times as well as the collapse of these kingdoms (empires). When he was told to \u05e7\u05d7\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea, \u201ctake for Me a three year old calf,\u201d (verses 8) this was a reference to the fourth (and last) of these empires, which would subjugate the Jews more cruelly and for longer than any other. This has been confirmed by a vision experienced by Daniel, (Daniel 7,7) with the words: \u05d3\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9, \u201cexcessively terrifying and awesome.\u201d The \u05e2\u05d6 \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea , \u201cthree year old goat,\u201d represents the Greek empire. (Daniel, 8,5 \u05d5\u05e6\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0 \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1, \u201cand the-goat came from the west across the surface of the whole earth.) The three year old ram, \u05d0\u05d9\u05dc \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9, represents the empire of the Medes and Persians; mentioned in Daniel 8,8, i.e. \u05d5\u05e6\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dc \u05e2\u05d3 \u05de\u05d0\u05d3, \u201cand the he-goat grew exceedingly.\u201d The \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8, in our verse refers to the empire of the Ishmaelites. The word here has to be understood as the aramaic,\u05ea\u05e8 ,\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cox or bull\u201d. (The author on a Targum, unfamiliar to this editor) The \u05d2\u05d5\u05d6\u05dc in our verse refers to the Jewish people. It appears in that sense in Song of Songs, 2,14, as well as in the same Book, 6,9). <br>  Rabbi Acha claims that the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9 and \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea is a metaphor for anything that is exceedingly strong. He quotes as support for his view Kohelet 4,12: \u05d5\u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05de\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7, \u201cand the threefold cord will not tear easily.\u201d Rabbi Mesharshia, interpreting the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd, understands the rule of the empires while the Israelites are under their domination as occurring during three different periods in history. The first time each of these empires states, or Kingdoms, dominates the Israelites on their own. unaided by other powers. The second time, two of those powers combine in subjugating the Israelites On the third occasion, during the period ushering in the messianic age, they all combine in their assault, as a result of which the Messiah will appear. He quotes Psalms 2,2; \u05d9\u05ea\u05d9\u05e6\u05d1\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d3 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4' \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5, \u201call the kings of the earth and its regents will take a combined stand against the Lord and His messiah.\u201d Rabbi Yoshua, in referring to the phrase: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u201che divided them in the middle,\u201d understand the subject in that phrase as being the respective swords of Avraham\u2019s opponents, thus breaking their power in half. He adds that if Avraham had not succeeded in doing this, the earth as we know it could not have continued to function. Concerning the Torah writing that Avraham did not divide the \u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8, this is why that bird represents the Jewish people, and no other species of birds has ever been called tzipor, a young turtle dove. \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05d8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e4\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cwhen the vultures tried to descend on the cadavers, (Avraham chased them away).\u201d The word \u05e2\u05d9\u05d8 here is a metaphor for David (the King) he has been compared to a coloured vulture. Compare Jeremiah 12,9: \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05d8 \u05e6\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2 \u05e0\u05d7\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9 ,\u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05d8 \u05e1\u05d1\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4, \u05d0\u05e1\u05e4\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d4, (normal translation from beginning of that verse: \u201cMy own people acts towards Me like a bird of prey or hyena; let the birds of prey surround it, go gather the wild beasts bring them to devour.\u201d The metaphoric interpretation our author cites and which is also mentioned by Rashi, understands the \u05e2\u05d9\u05d8, as being coloured, as it is so different from all other birds and stands out therefore. The gentile nations view the Jewish people as different and therefore cannot abide it. They gather together in order to commit genocide of the Jewish people. This enables us to understand why Avraham in his dream is described as \u201creviving, \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1\u201d, the corpses of the slain Jews, so that we would have here a first hint that Jews will be resurrected in due course (as described in Ezekiel chapter 37). (Compare Psalms 147,18, where the expression yashev occurs in such a positive way.) Another explanation credited to Rabbi Eleazar, feels that our verse proves that the power of any of the aforementioned kingdoms which excel in persecuting Jews will not last for more that a single day in G\u2019d\u2019s calendar, as such a \u201cday\u201d is a thousand years in our calendar. (Compare Psalms 90,4: \u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e3 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05da \u05db\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cfor one thousand years in Your eyes are as yesterday that has passed.\u201d) A colleague of Rabbi Eleazar concurred with him, adding that additional proof could be cited from Lamentations 1,13, \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05de\u05d4 \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd, \u201cHe made me desolate all day long.\u201d The power of this last empire would gradually evaporate in the west, symbol of the day coming to an end, and the ascent of the Jewish people would commence in the evening as predicted in Zachariah 14,7: \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8, \u201cand it will be that at evening time there will be light.\u201d Another thing that can be predicted based on Avraham\u2019s dream and its wording is that there will be a total of four eras of suppression of the Jewish people; the expression \u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e9\u05d9\u05db\u05d4, refers to the suppression of the Jewish religion in the time of the Seleucids, Antiochus, who tried to eradicate us spiritually by forbidding us to practice our religion, whereas the empire following the decline of the Greeks, the Medes produced Haman who tried to eradicate us physically. The word \u05e0\u05d5\u05e4\u05dc\u05ea, refers to the Babylonian empire during the heyday of which the first Temple was destroyed and most of our people (that had not been exiled when the ten tribes were exiled by the Assyrians), were exiled. The word \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 refers to the suppression of our people by the Ishmaelites, who will be overcome by the Messiah, descendant of David, as predicted in Psalms 132,18: \u05e9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e6\u05de\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e7\u05e8\u05df \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3, \u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e8 \u05dc\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9, \u201cthere I will make a horn sprout for David, I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.\u201d Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah is on record as having said that these empires were created by G\u2019d only to serve G\u2019d as firewood to heat up the fires in hell. This is why the Torah wrote here: \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e2\u05e9\u05df \u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e9, \u201cand behold there was a furnace and a flaming torch (verse 17),\u201d and we find a reference to this phenomenon also in Isaiah 31,9: \u05e0\u05d0\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4' \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d5\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, \u201csays the Lord Who has a fire in Zion and a furnace in Jerusalem.\u201d This is the way in which G\u2019d illustrated to him that there is such a region we call gehinom, (hell). He also showed him the Torah and the animals used for the sacrificial service in the Temple, indicating to him that as long as his descendants would observe both, they would never have to be afraid of gehinom. Nonetheless, He showed that even the Temple would be destroyed one day, so that the sacrificial service would not be able to be performed. He asked Avraham if he preferred that his descendants descend to gehinom at a time like that, or if he preferred that they endure slavery and persecution while alive on earth. Avraham was in a quandary how to answer such a question. This is why we read in Deuteronomy 32,30, that even the gentiles came to the conclusion that the sudden and drastic decline of the fortunes of the Jewish people could only have come about because their \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8, (Rock), metaphor for the patriarch Avraham in this case, had \u201csold them out.\u201d (had chosen persecution and exile for his descendants rather than gehinom.) According to Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, an ancient kabalistic text chapter 28 the word \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8 in Isaiah 51,1: \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05e6\u05d1\u05ea\u05dd, \u201clook at the tzur from which you have been hewn,\u201d is also a reference to the patriarch Avraham. [My edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, while quoting Isaiah 31,9 in the sense that our author quoted Rabbi Eliezer ben Azaryah having done, does not refer to Isaiah 51,1 at all. Most of the other text quoted here has been taken from that chapter in Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. Ed.] [In the event that any of my readers finds it strange that the 400 years of bondage etc. in Egypt are not referred to in Avraham\u2019s dream at all, 1) he was told about this while awake, 2) in Egypt the Israelites had not been a people in the sense of having their own land and a political union known as \u201cstate.\u201d This only began at the time of the Exodus, and specifically when Joshua conquered the land of Canaan.

Another interesting explanation is that the numerical value of the letters in Avraham\u2019s question \u05d1\u05de\u05d4 adds up to 400 when you use the system known as  \u05d0-\u05ea, \u05d1-\u05e9, \u05d2-\u05e8, i.e. substituting the letters commencing by reading the alphah-bet backwards. Furthermore, the Talmud in tractate Nedarim folio 32, comes to the conclusion that the Jewish people had to suffer the penalty for their founding father having asked G\u2019d for proof that His promise would come true, [although seeing that he had been unable to have children until that time would seem to us as a reasonable question. Ed.] Another reason given is that when Avraham agreed to the King of Sodom to have his citizens whom he had taken prisoner restored to him, he is punished for missing out on a chance to convert these people to monotheism.

The reason for the extra letter \u05d9 is that this is a hint to Avraham that the Egyptians will have to endure ten plagues before releasing the Israelites.

The numerical value of the letters in Avraham\u2019s name would then amount to 248, the number of limbs in his body. This is the conclusion arrived at in the Talmud, tractate Nedarim folio 32. According to Romi bar Abba, the reason why Abraham was first known as \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05dd and subsequently as \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd is that originally G\u2019d gave him control over 243 limbs, whereas from now on he had control over all of his 248 limbs. They are: two eyes, two ears, his torso, his head. If you want to realise how important the physical act of circumcision was, you will find this explained on folio 31 of tractate Nedarim. In the commentary known as Mechilta, it is stated that the reason why both Avraham and Sarah are never again referred to by their original names, as opposed to Yaakov, who after G\u2019d changed his name to Yisrael is frequently still referred to by his original name Yaakov, this is because after both had their names changed, their original names had not been obliterated completely as the letters of their original names had been retained also as part of their new names. Their names had only been \u201cimproved.\u201d Israel being a totally new name was not meant to invalidate his original name. The only reason we know this is because the Torah continues to make use of it. [The name Yaakov, given to him by outsiders, not his father, had suggested that he was somehow inferior spiritually already from birth. The angel in his nocturnal wrestling match had alluded to this. (Genesis 32,29) The Torah by continuing to use it, shows that in G\u2019d\u2019s eyes it never reflected upon him in a negative fashion. Ed.] The sages of the Mechilta add further that the reason why the name of the third patriarch, Yitzchok, has never been changed or amended, is that he had been named by G\u2019d Himself, long before he had even been born.

This is why this revelation took place while Avraham was on his property. The obvious question here is why someone of the stature of Avraham needed to consult with his friends about if and how to relate to G\u2019d\u2019s commandment. He had been tested as to his faith in Him on ten occasions, and he had passed all these tests without consulting with anyone, why would he suddenly feel the need to \u201cconsult\u201d anyone? The answer clearly must be that Avraham did not \u201cconsult\u201d with anyone in order to decide if to carry out G\u2019d\u2019s command; he only asked his friends if to perform this commandment on himself in the privacy of his tent or publicly, in order to demonstrate his loyalty to G\u2019d\u2019s command. His purpose in doing so publicly would be in order to encourage others to emulate his example. When the Torah described him as performing the act of circumcision \u05d1\u05e2\u05e6\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4, (Genesis 17,23) these words mean: \u201cin broad daylight, for all to see.\u201d Mamre was given credit by G\u2019d for having given Avraham this advice. A different interpretation of our verse: Avraham consulted with Mamre regarding the exact part of his body where the \u201ccircumcision\u201d had to be performed. He therefore advised him to perform this operation on the organ that represented his masculinity. After all, G\u2019d had restricted the performance of this rite to the males of the species. (17,10) He also advised him to commence with circumcising himself and his son Ishmael first. Once his slaves and friends would observe this, most of them would follow willingly without protest. The Torah testifies in chapter 17, verse 27 that all the members of Avraham\u2019s household (including hired help) were circumcised on the same day that he was. If you were to ask why Mamre, himself, who gave Avraham this advice, did not have himself circumcised also, the answer is that eventually he did do so as reported in a Midrash.", "1": "\u05db\u05d7\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd, \u201cduring the hottest part of the day.\u201d This is the time at which people consume their lunch.

Avraham at the time was on the lookout for prospective guests at the entrance to his tent."}, "1": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d7 \u05d7\u05de\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d7\u05dc\u05d1, \u201che took curd and milk, etc.\u201d this teaches that he fed them both milky and meaty dishes. When G\u2019d was ready to give the Torah to the Israelites, the angels are reported as having said to Him (Psalms 8,2): \u05ea\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05da \u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cYou have covered the heavens with Your glory\u201d [This is perceived as the angels demanding that the Torah remain in the celestial regions of the universe. Ed.] G\u2019d replied to them: \u201cin My Torah it is written that milky and meaty dishes not be consumed at the same meal (Exodus 23,19), yet when you descended to earth you partook of such a mixture at Avraham\u2019s table. (The inference is clear, i.e. \u201cthe laws of the Torah do not apply to you.\u201d) As soon as the angels heard this they withdrew their objections to the Torah being given to people on earth. This is the deeper meaning of Exodus 34,27: \u05db\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05db\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea\u05da \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201cfor in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.\u201d What do \u201cthese words\u201d refer to? They refer to the verse prior to this where eating meaty and milky dishes at the same time has been prohibited. Nonetheless, this metaphorical explanation appears to contradict another metaphorical interpretation (Midrash) in which we have been taught that Avraham personally observed not only all the Biblical laws of the Torah, but even the \u201cfences\u201d surrounding them to protect us against violating the prohibition itself. The particular example quoted there for such a \u201cfence\u201d is interestingly the subject of eyruv tavshilin, certain preparations of food when the holiday occurs immediately before the Sabbath. But that is not the only way of explaining the Midrash. The word: eyruv, actually means \u201cmixture,\u201d so that the Midrash may have referred to a mixture of meaty and milky courses of the same meal, so that there is no contradiction at all. Seeing that Avraham is reported as first having served milky dishes, and the meat subsequently, it is reasonable to assume that he wished to give his guests something to eat before freshly slaughtered animals, that had to have their blood removed could be cooked or roasted on the spit. The interval would have sufficed not to violate the laws of mixing milk and meat.

The author of that opinion quotes Psalms 101,7: \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05e0\u05d2\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9, \u201che who speaks untruths shall not stand before My eyes,\u201d in support of his statement. He claims further that what Sarah had (thought) reported as having said was indeed what is quoted by the Torah, i.e. \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05e7\u05e0\u05ea\u05d9, \u201cand I have become old.\u201d These words are to be understood as her wonderment at how she could have become pregnant even in spite of having seen menstrual blood once more, seeing she was way beyond child-bearing age, and had never previously conceived. The angel did not alter her words, he only did not report all of her words. In this manner he prevented any bad feeling on the part of Avraham. Any ordinary person, other than a Divine creature, is permitted to tell white lies in order to preserve \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea, family harmony. If you were to argue that Avraham would not have cared, seeing that he was aware that what she thought or said was true, we must assume that he was still trying to impregnate Sarah but had been unsuccessful.\n"}, "4": {"0": "\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05da, \u201cat the appointed time I will return to you, etc.\u201d this phrasing is a hint that the birth of Yitzchok would occur on a date subsequently part of the Passover festival. (Talmud tractate Rosh Hashanah folio 11). The numerical value of the letters in the word \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 equals the numerical value of the letters in the word \u05d1\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 (150).", "1": "\u05db\u05e2\u05ea \u05d7\u05d9\u05d4, according to Rashi, this means \u201cat a time of year such as now, when nature is in full bloom, entirely alive.\u201d Seeing that the angel did not say \u05d1\u05e2\u05ea, at the time, but \u05db\u05e2\u05ea, \u201caround that time,\u201d it is clear that he referred to the time when Sarah\u2019s pregnancy would result in her giving natural birth at the end of the cycle. She would not give birth prematurely. The expression \u05d7\u05d9\u05d4 for a woman giving birth occurs elsewhere also. Our sages in the Talmud tractate Taanit folio 2, have stated that there are three keys which G\u2019d does not hand over to any agent (prophet or angel) They are: the key to resurrections, to rainfall, and to giving birth. This is also why the angel could not predict the precise date when Sarah would give birth, only an approximation, i.e. \u05db\u05e2\u05ea, \u201cat approximately that time.\u201d I believe that Rashi\u2019s interpretation of these verses coincides with the one we find in the historical text known as Seder olam, world history, as well as with the commentary in the Mechilta. (chapter 5) According to those calculations, G\u2019d had had this conversation with Avraham culminating in the destruction of Sodom on the fifteenth day of Nissan. Yitzchok was born on that day in the year following. According to B\u2019reshit Rabbah 48,12, the words Avraham had used when telling Sarah to knead and bake bread, \u05dc\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d2\u05d5\u05ea, also suggest that it was Passover (the date of) [as did the fact that on the evening of that same day, Lot fed the angels matzot, unleavened bread. (Genesis 19,3) Ed.] This date had also been referred to in conjunction with the circumcision (Genesis 17,21) when G\u2019d had told Avraham about the birth of this son whom he was to call Yitzchok. At that time the time frame told him was: \u201cnext year.\u201d <br>  However, the above is in contradiction to what we read in the first chapter of the tractate Roshashah, folio 11, where the words:  \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05da are understood to refer to the dates on which the Sukkot festival would occur in the future. The first \u201c\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u201d would then have been Passover. This would also agree with what we have read in Pirke de rabbi Eliezer chapter 29, according to which Avraham circumcised himself on the date of the day of Atonement. In the Talmud, tractate Baba Metzia, folio 87, the angels are reported as having visited Avraham on the third day after his circumcision, and that is when Sarah overheard the prediction that she would give birth to a son, and that the words \u201cat this time,\u201d have to be understood as 2 days prior to the date of Sukkot. It is also stated in the Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah, that Sarah became pregnant on Rosh Hashanah. When mention is made elsewhere that this occurred on the festival, this need not be understood literally, as it was two days earlier. Furthermore, according to our tradition, also Rachel and Chanah who had endured years of being unable to conceive were remembered by G\u2019d on that festival and became pregnant and subsequently gave birth. This is the version of events accepted by Rashi. If one were to question what precisely was meant by the angel speaking of the \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 in the following year, if it would refer to Sukkot, that would be more than a year later, as the next festival would be Passover in the same year, we must assume that the quotation from the Talmud is by a sage who accepts the opinion of Rabbi Yoshua, that the earth was created in the month of Nissan, (Rosh Hashanah there), in which case Passover would be in the following year and that this is why the angel added words that applied to the following year. [The important thing is that the Torah testifies that Sarah gave birth at the time that been predicted here, compare Genesis 21,2. Ed.]\n"}, "5": {"0": "\u05d4\u05de\u05db\u05e1\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9...\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc, \u201chow can I conceal from Avraham...seeing that he will develop into a great and important nation?\u201d G\u2019d would not have revealed the future to Avraham except for the fact that he had a future way beyond his physical death.

He would not accept less than a minimum of ten innocent people per town. If Rashi were correct, why did G\u2019d answer Avraham when he asked about 45 righteous people with the words: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05ea, \u201cI will not destroy?\u201d He repeated answering him with the same answer when twenty or thirty righteous people were the subject of Avraham\u2019s question or plea? G\u2019d had made it plain that in order to forgive all five cities there had to be no less that 50 righteous people, i.e. at least ten in each of them. If there were twenty or thirty, the cities containing them would be saved, but none that contained fewer. The promise not to destroy included also not imposing other hardships on those cities at the present state, When Avraham asked about the forty five, he meant that if G\u2019d Himself would not be prepared to be the tenth in each town so that all the inhabitants at this time would be spared. He did not mean that if there were only nine righteous people in each town that they would go scot free; they would not be destroyed but be subjected to a lesser punishment. G\u2019d promised that if there were at least ten righteous people in any one of these cities, not only would He spare that city from destruction, but He would not exact judgments from its guilty people at that time. The number ten is a round number and therefore important enough not only to protect that quorum but also those living alongside them. [Avraham could not have been completely ignorant of this, else why did he not start with a higher number? Ed.] He knew that the eight people in Noach\u2019s ark had not been enough to save the remainder of the human species from destruction at that time, including devastating the earth they had dwelled on. Avraham knew that it would be pointless to ask G\u2019d to desist from destroying all these towns when they could not even point to a quorum of righteous people in any of their cities. At any rate, counting a righteous person in one city, i.e. a city that had eleven righteous people as if the eleven would be added to nine righteous people in another town was also not acceptable. Some commentators hold that the reason that Avraham did not pray for less than ten people was that he thought that Lot, his wife, four children and their spouses, would have made up the quorum. G\u2019d\u2019s response reassured him that if indeed Lot and his family were righteous, they would not be killed in what was about to happen."}, "16": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05e1\u05d3\u05d5\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1, \u201ctwo of the angels arrived in Sodom in the evening;\u201d when Lot saw them, he asked them for the purpose of their visit.

The reason why they volunteered this information was that they said to themselves that if they were simply to order him to leave town with their families without giving them a plausible reason, they would simply ignore them. But, since they had taken it upon themselves to reveal something G\u2019d had not intended to be revealed at that time, they were punished by Him, by being exiled from the celestial regions for 138 years. This was in spite of the fact that what they had done had been well intentioned. Angels are subject to penalties even for committing \u201cminor\u201d errors by not having checked with their Master first, relying on the superior wisdom with which they had been endowed. This superior knowledge enables them to know what goes on in the minds of human beings. We find another example of punishment as warnings for celestial creatures where Mattatron, G\u2019d\u2019s \u201cgeneral manager\u201d for running the universe on His behalf, was punished as stated in the Talmud tractate Chagigah, folio 15. This angel was expelled (temporarily) from the celestial regions and punished with sixty fiery strokes, in order to warn him not to fall victim to the same error as Elisha ben Avuyah on earth, who had arrived at the conclusion that Satan is an independent force in the universe rather than also a messenger carrying out missions on behalf of his Divine master. Rabbi Yehudah hachassid said that angels are punished with sixty lashes whereas human beings are not punished by more than forty (39) lashes, is that on earth already thirteen year olds qualify for such punishment, whereas such punishments are inflicted on over twenty year olds in the celestial regions. Just as 39 lashes on earth are three times thirteen so sixty is three times twenty.\n", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u201cand there is no other man left on earth to impregnate us with his sperm.\u201d According to Ibn Ezra, they did not think that there were no more males alive on earth, but they thought no other man would be a suitable marriage partner for them for spiritual reasons.

Ram\u2019s horns which are open ended at both ends are to remind the Jewish people that though they will seemingly enter a dark tunnel when sinning, there is light at the end of the tunnel if they do penitence; blowing the ram\u2019s horns when asking G\u2019d for forgiveness is one of the means of obtaining forgiveness.

When we accept that the word \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4, \u201cand these,\u201d are a hint that he had become a penitent, as Rashi derives from the manner in which his burial is described in the Torah in same verse from the fact that he is described as having been gathered into his forefathers, and we know that a proselyte is considered as if newly born from the day of his conversion, i.e. free from sin, it follows that the years he had lived prior to this have now been converted as a prelude to his conversion, i.e. as part of that conversion process. Another way of explaining the Torah\u2019s wording of the death and burial of Yishmael: the Torah did not preface his death with the unusual words: \u201cand the lives of Sarah were,\u201c words which alert us that they must have more meaning than the plain text suggests. When Sarah\u2019s death is reported the word \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9, \u201clives of,\u201d is mentioned twice, not only once. This calls for closer examination.

The answer given is that when someone brings a Torah scholar a gift it is considered by our sages as if that person had personally erected the Temple and had offered the first fruit, bikkurim, therein (Talmud tractate Ketuvot folio 105). We find a third occasion when unnecessary repetition seems to occur in the Bible in the Book of Joshua (Joshua 7,10) in connection with Achan who had stolen from the loot of Jericho; in that report the word \u05d2\u05dd is repeated five times, though it could easily been avoided. On that occasion our sages interpret the constant repetition of the word \u05d2\u05dd by saying that it teaches that if someone steals property belonging to the Temple treasure it is considered as if he had transgressed all the commandments of the Five Books of Moses. Another way of looking at this particular example: If you take the respective first and last letters in the last letter of each of the five Books of Moses, i.e. the letters \u05d1-\u05dd from the last word in the Book of Genesis \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, plus the letters \u05de-\u05dd in the word \u05de\u05e1\u05e2\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd at the end of the Book of Exodus, plus the letters \u05e1-\u05d9 from the word \u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 at the end of the Book of Leviticus, plus the two letters \u05d9-\u05e8 of the word \u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5 at the end of the Book of Numbers, i.e. \u05e1-\u05d9 from the word \u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 at the end of the Book of Numbers, plus the letters \u05d9-\u05dc from the word \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc at the end of the Book of Deuteronomy you will have the numerical value of the word \u05d7\u05e8\u05dd=248. The sin of Achan was stealing from \u05d7\u05e8\u05dd, from what belongs to G\u2019d.

We find a similar situation in Ruth 2,6, when Ruth is \u201creturning\u201d to the land of Israel with her mother-in-law Naomi, and although Ruth had never been there before, she too is described by one of Boaz\u2019s hired hands as \u201creturning\u201d from the land of Moab.

When we examine Eliezer\u2019s request, if a blind girl had performed the tasks he had requested as proof of her worthiness to become the wife of Yitzchok, he would have had to choose her.

He then asked her about her family status, and when told that she was member of Avraham\u2019s family he gave here the jewelry as a gift. The Torah abbreviated somewhat in its report of what happened, something that is not unusual. That this is so is clear from the sequence of events Eliezer described during the meal, when he filled in the words that have been omitted here. Even here, (contrary to the way some people interpret our verse) the Torah did not write that he gave her the jewelry before having established her family status.", "5": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9, \u201cperhaps the woman (that I chose) will not follow me.

[Rashi bases himself on an interpretation by B\u2019reshit Rabbah on why in the report of the conversation between Avraham and Eliezer on the same subject in 24,5 that letter \u05d5 is not missing. Ed.] It is difficult to understand why he did not write this comment already on verse eight in this chapter where Avraham had not excluded a marital union with the daughters of any of his three friends Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, although they were Canaanites, and not slaves from Damascus, and Avraham had Eliezer released him from his oath in the event that a girl from Charan were to refuse to move to the land of Canaan. We must assume that Avraham had felt that the curse that rested on Canaan had already run its course, whereas the curse on Eliezer\u2019s antecedents had not yet run its course, so that marriage into that family would be spiritually much more dangerous. B\u2019reshit Rabbah 59,9, states specifically that Eliezer was a descendant of Cham, whose son Canaan Noach had cursed. In the book: Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 15, Eliezer is identified with Og King of Bashan, whom the Israelites slew in a battle during their last year in the desert. [My edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer does not have this, and my research of a lengthy article about Og by Dr Admiel Kosman of the Bar Ilan university, also does not bring any source for that statement. Ed.] According to our author, the following is the text in his edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. \u201cEliezer has been described as the most senior servant, and added that he was a servant for evermore. When he did Yitzchok a great favour by choosing a wonderful wife for him, Yitzchok freed him forever. G\u2019d then rewarded Og by making him King of Bashan. If this is true, why did G\u2019d order Moses to kill Og as a punishment for defending his country against invaders? According to Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer he was a perfectly righteous man! We also know from the Talmud, tractate Sofrim chapter 21, as well as from Derech Eretz zuttah, tractate Sotah, 1, that he was one of only nine people who immediately upon drawing their last breath had their souls transferred to the spiritual hereafter. This matter was discussed in connection with a tradition that when Yitzchok first joined Rivkah in the marital bed, and found that she was not a virgin, he suspected Eliezer as having been to blame for this. He said to him: \u201cmay you live as long and enter paradise as you are innocent of my accusation!\u201d In light of all the above, we must assume that there had been two Kings called King of Bashan, one during Avraham\u2019s lifetime and another during Moses\u2019 lifetime. It was the former who was so righteous.

We have to conclude that both Avraham and Yishmael were actually converts, neither having been born as Jews. Converts do not legally inherit their fellow converts, neither by Biblical law nor by Rabbinic decree. (Talmud tractate Kidushin folio 17). Rabbeinu Chananel bar Sh\u2019muel suggests that Avraham gave all he had to Yitzchok before the sons of Keturah had been born, This is indicated by this having been reported already in Genesis 24,36: where he is reported immediately after Sarah having given birth to him as receiving all of his father\u2019s estate. [Seeing that Yishmael, as Hagar\u2019s son was the son of a slave woman, he could not legally own anything that had been Avraham\u2019s or Sarah\u2019s as slaves do not own their master\u2019s or their mistress\u2019 property.

Even nowadays, according to our author, the Moslems who are trained in theology are able to do this without coming to any harm thereby. It was difficult for Rabbi Moses to understand how Avraham a great and devout man could possibly have taught the holy Name of the Lord to wicked people. In view of this problem, Rabbi Yaakov, son of Rabbi Nachman, interpreted that line in the Talmud differently by saying that the word \u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4 used in the Talmud there refers to the names of certain demons. The names of these demons are associated with the evil spirits making their homes in certain ruins, or certain cemeteries as described by the Talmud in tractate Chagigah folio 3. This is alluded to by the fact that the spelling of the word \u201cmatanot\u201d is spelled as if it were a singular, the letter \u05d5 having been omitted.

This is difficult as we have learned from the Sifri that there were three people who reached the same age, i.e. Kehat, Ben Azzai and Rivkah, and the Torah stated that Kehat died at the age of one hundred and thirty three. (Exodus 6,18.) If this were correct she must have been eleven years older than three when she married Yitzchok. [There is no Sifri on the Book of Genesis, but the Midrash hagadol, which originated in Yemen, also claims that Rivkah was 14 years old when she married Yitzchok. Ed.] Rashi\u2019s calculation goes as follows: Rivkah was married at 3 years, and was 23 years old when she gave birth to Esau and Yaakov. Yaakov was 63 years old when he fled to Padan Aram as Rashi explains at the end of this portion. He then spent 14 years in the academy headed by Ever, great grandson of Noach. After that he worked 20 years for his uncle Lavan. He spent 2 years on his return journey home during which time he was informed by Rivkah\u2019s nursemaid that his mother had died, as Rashi explains at the end of parshat Vayishlach, in connection with the burial of that nursemaid called Devorah, and the naming of an oak tree after her. According to this calculation, Rivkah could not have lived to an age older than 123 years. This is also the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah according to whom Rivkah must have been 14 years old when she got married. If you accept that view, Rivkah died at the age of 133.", "1": "According to this calculation, what we read in seder olam, chapter 1, that Avraham was informed about the birth of Rivkah while on the way home from the binding of Yitzchok, she must have been 11 years old already at that time. This is what bothered Rabbi Moshe Shlomoh ben Avraham known by the acrostic \u05d0\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05de\u05d0\"\u05df, when discussing that a virgin is given 12 month between betrothal and consummation of the marriage (Talmud tractate Ketuvot, folio 57) The Talmud there derives this from the words in our portion, when Rivkah\u2019s family demanded 12 months delay from Eliezer before Rivkah going with him. If Rivkah had been 14 years old already, she would have been considered an adult, and her father would not have had the right to tell her what to do (unless she still continued to live in his house) The Talmud there gives a girl who is over twelve and a half years old at betrothal only thirty days before becoming wed to her fiance, just as the length of time required before a widow can remarry.

Something similar is related in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat, folio 134, where Rabbi Nathan relates that he once met a lady who had lost two of her children as a result of circumcision. She asked him if she had to circumcise her third son also and risk losing him too. When Rabbi Nathan looked at the infant, he noted that his skin looked extremely red. He therefore told his mother to wait with circumcising him until this red skin would become normal looking. She did so, and circumcised him in due course and he survived without further problem. When Yitzchok waited a year or two for the skin colour of Esau to change and it did not happen, he assumed that this son was going to remain in that condition, but he still did not circumcise him. When he turned 13, he still restrained himself from circumcising him. He had waited all this time thinking that seeing he had not been circumcised at the age of eight days he would circumcise him at the age Yishmael had been circumcised.

A different interpretation of that verse in Isaiah [which begs the question, Ed.] by Yalkut Shimoni: Yaakov released Avraham from the heartache associated with trying to raise children.

The root \u05e7\u05e8\u05d4 occurs only in connection with things which occurred without visible preparation for use at a certain moment.

By doing so he implied that this blessing was conditional on the person on whom it had been bestowed being worthy of it. Nonetheless, when it comes to Esau, we see that Yitzchok does not include such a condition in his blessing, as in verse 39 in our chapter he reassures him by saying: \u201cyour dwelling will be in the fat parts of the earth and you will enjoy the dew from above. You will live by the sword, although you will serve your brother.\u201d He adds that on the contrary, the blessing given to his brother Yaakov is conditional on his not making your life intolerable.\u201d [my choice of words. Ed.] It is noteworthy that in his lengthy prayer after consecrating the Temple he has built, King Solomon attaches the condition of worthiness when speaking of how G\u2019d shall respond to the prayers of the Israelites, whereas when speaking of gentiles coming to Jerusalem to pray there, he does not attach such a condition but asks G\u2019d to grant the wishes of such gentiles, regardless. (Kings I 8,32-43) Solomon is concerned that the gentiles should not get the impressions that our G\u2019d is someone with Whom one needs to bargain. Yitzchok was concerned about the same when realising that Esau, if he insisted on his blessing surely credited G\u2019d in heaven with being the One Who would provide its becoming reality. If he did not think so, why would he demand it? [When G\u2019d fulfills the requests of a gentile, without regard to his worthiness, if the gentile as a result does not become G\u2019d fearing and grateful, he will find that the very fulfillment of his request will eventually boomerang and he will more than lose its benefit. Ed.] You will also find that there are ten different categories of blessings, corresponding to the ten utterances used by G\u2019d when He created His universe, and corresponding to the Ten Commandments. These blessings were pronounced on seven different occasions. 1) here; 2).Genesis 28,3: \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05e9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05da and the attribute of G\u2019d known as shadday will bless you. 3) Genesis 28,13 (to Yaakov); 4) Genesis 32,27: \u201cI will not let you depart (Yaakov to the angel he had wrestled) until you bless me;\u201d 5) Genesis 35,9: \u201cG\u2019d appeared to Yaakov;\u201d 6) Genesis 46,3; and Genesis 12,2, where G\u2019d blessed Avraham for the first time. Avraham was blessed by G\u2019d on seven different occasions. The Jewish people were given seven different (days) that are holy, most of them festivals: Sabbath, Passover, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Sh\u2019mini Atzeret.

This did not include mature animals with those skin patters. Lavan removed all such animals regardless of their age, making it almost impossible for animals that had never shown such skin patterns to bear young ones that did. He was therefore perfectly fair in looking after his own interests, seeing Lavan had made it almost impossible for him to own flocks of his own without resorting to ingenuity; as a matter of fact he did so, with the help of advice from an angel in a dream, as we read in 31,10. In addition, the sage Rabbi Chayim added that careful reading of the text will show that Lavan changed unilaterally the terms of their contract, which had referred only to animals with the skin pattern known as \u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, whereas he now had added those with skin patterns known as \u05e2\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd. This is why Yaakov on his part saw free to do what he did, fulfilling what is written in Samuel II 22,27: \u05e2\u05dd \u05e2\u05e7\u05e9 \u05ea\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc, (David speaking) \u201cand with the deceitful people You will find ways to make them cause their own downfall.\u201d\n", "4": "\u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cthe sturdier ones;\u201d According to Rashi the meaning of the word is: \u05de\u05d1\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cthe ones liable to give birth early in the season because they conceived without difficulties.\u201d Although he attributes this interpretation to Targum Onkelos, he was unable to quote proof, and neither did Onkelos quote proof. I believe that the word is connected to the root: \u05e7\u05e9\u05e8, \u201cknot.\u201d It was the custom in those days to tie a knot to the firstborn animal of each mother, in order to be able to identify these animals later on as they were presumed to be stronger, or at any rate preferred by their owners to those born later. This would prevent them from being confused with animals born by the same mother animal in subsequent years. We know from Genesis 38,28, that the midwife of Tamar also tied a knot to the twin that appeared to be born first from its mother\u2019s womb.

They inscribed on the forehead of that slain person the name of a deity such as a demon, hung it up under the tongue of the slain person on the wall, lit candles in its honour, prostrated themselves before it, and it would start speaking to the worshipper.

One of his children was fatally injured by a polecat, the other drowned in a cistern. In other words, each one of his children was killed by one of his witnesses to the oath he had broken.

As soon as he was hauled out of the pit he regained his former looks. The sellers were now not prepared to sell him for so little money and they were about to throw him back into the pit. In order to prevent this, the Ishmaelites added shoes of their own free will in order to satisfy the Midianite merchants. This is what the prophet Amos referred to (Amos 2,6) when he said: \u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05db\u05e8\u05dd \u05d1\u05db\u05e1\u05e3 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cbecause they have sold for silver those whose cause was just and the needy for a pair of sandals.\u201d As soon as the Ishmaelites offered more than originally, the Midianites raised Joseph from the pit again.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthey sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites. According to Rashi, the subject here are the brothers, who sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites, whereupon the latter sold him to the Midianites who in turn sold him to the Egyptians. If so, we must understand the whole paragraph as follows: They (the brothers who had sat down to eat but had not eaten yet) raised their eyes (verse 25) and they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites approaching, (from the east travelling south) while at the same time Midianite merchants arrived at the pit from a different direction who (eventually) hauled Joseph out of the pit. (verse 28) [Remember the brothers had sat down for lunch some distance from the pit so that they would not hear Joseph\u2019s cries. Ed.] These Midianites sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver. The reason why the Torah mentions this at this stage is that we should not wonder when the Torah in verse 36 reports that the Medanim had sold Joseph already some time previously to the Egyptians. The individual Egyptian who purchased Joseph was Potiphar. Most of this had taken place while the brothers had still argued among themselves if to sell him to the Ishmaelites. They had been pre-empted in the meantime by the Midianites. The Midianites in the meantime had become witnesses to the discussions among Joseph\u2019s brothers and had bought Joseph subsequently from the Ishmaelites. They were certain that Joseph had been hauled up from the pit in order that he could be sold to them. There were two separate groups of people, some called Medanim, and the others Midianim. The Ishmaelites who were traveling in the direction of Egypt, were the ones who sold Joseph to Potiphar once they had arrived in Egypt. If you were to say why does the Torah write in verse 36 the Medanim had sold him to Egypt, so that eventually he was sold to Potiphar, etc.? We would have expected the subject in that verse to have been the Midianites! Rash\u2019bam in his commentary on the Chumash claims that the three people mentioned in this story, i.e. the Ishmaelites, Midianites, and Medonites, were all members of the same people though not of the same tribe. Their founder fathers were all brothers from the same mother and father Avraham-Keturah (Hagar), as we know (assuming that Keturah was identical with Hagar) (Compare Genesis 25,2) The query mentioned above was already raised by Rashi, (verse 3) we quote him (the Midrash which he quotes) literally: the word \u05e4\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd in the garment described as \u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea \u05e4\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd, contains a hint of future problems, being sold four times, Joseph would endure. The letter \u05e4 refers to Potiphar to whom he had been sold. The letter \u05e1 refers to the \u05e1\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, the merchants (verse 28) the letter \u05d9 to the Ishmaelites, and the letter \u05dd to the Medonites. The problem with the Midrash is that only three sales have been reported in the Torah. In view of this difficulty I suggest the following: concerning the line (verse 25) \u2018they raised their eyes and here there was approaching a caravan of Ishmaelites, etc.;\u201d this happened while the brothers were discussing among themselves how to proceed from there. They hit on the idea of selling Joseph to the members of that caravan. Before the caravan of |shmaelites had even reached them, another group of Midianite merchants had passed the pit from the opposite direction and hearing his cries, sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites before even having raised him from the pit, for the measly amount of 20 pieces of silver. They then hauled Joseph from the pit alive. The Ishmaelites sold him to the Medonites, and these in turn sold him to Potiphar. So we do have four separate sales. When the Torah wrote in Genesis 39,1 that Potiphar acquired him from the Ishmaelites, this is quite correct as when Potiphar set eyes on him he looked very handsome, and he reasoned that \u201cnegroes do not sell whites, whereas whites sell negroes;\u201d in other words, he considered it unlikely that the Medonites had come by Joseph legally, and he wanted reassurance that he did not buy someone who had been kidnapped. The |shmaelites who had sold him to the Medonites gave Potiphar a guarantee that everything was completely legal.

This question had been raised in Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 38. One of the answers given there is that he had become so upset as a result of his experiences that he had not only lost his good looks but had also become physically completely weakened; [my edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer only quotes the verse from Amos 2,6, from which he derives that each brother bought himself a pair of sandals for the 2 pieces of silver he had received from that sale.

[one of two explanations which Rashi suggests, the more likely correct one. Ed.] This explanation is difficult, seeing that the Talmud in tractate Makkot folio 11, arrives at the conclusion that Yehudah had been the first person ever to have done real penance by admitting his sin publicly, so that his brother learned from him when admitting being the father of the fetus his daughter-in-law Tamar was carrying in her womb. (Genesis 38,26) From that statement it is clear that at this stage Reuven had not felt the need to do penance. He did so only after Yehudah had set the example, which clearly had been some time after the sale of Joseph. Possibly, in order to solve this problem, perhaps the Talmud meant that until Yehudah had confessed publicly, Reuven had only done penance in the privacy his own house. He had been wearing sackcloth in his house already at this point.", "9": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e4\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthey sent Joseph\u2019s special garment,\u201d (suitably torn and drenched in blood).

These had been married by their respective half-brothers, sons of different mothers. According to the opinion of Rabbi Nechemyah, all the sons married wives of Canaanite origin. If he were correct, why does the Torah in our verse not speak of \u201call his daughter-in-law?\u201c Rabbi Nechemyah, aware of this, would reply, that in the whole world daughters-in-law are referred to as daughters. (B\u2018reshit Rabbah 84,21) [Naomi, in the Book of Ruth, certainly is not described as calling her daughters-in-law, \u201cdaughters.\u201d Ed.] It is difficult to understand Rabbi Nechemyah, as we all know to what length Avraham had gone to prevent Yitzchok from marrying a wife of Canaanite descent. Yitzchok too had commanded Yaakov not to marry a woman of Canaanite descent and had sent him all the way to Charan to avoid such a union. (Genesis 28,1) Nonetheless, Yehudah married a woman of Canaanite descent. (Genesis 38,2 \u05d1\u05e8\u05ea \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05ea\u05d2\u05e8\u05d0, (daughter of a business man, according to Onkelos \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05db\u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9 means business man, traveling salesman) Onkelos therefore accepts the view of Rabbi Yehudah, who said that twin daughters were born with all of Yaakov\u2019s sons.) This is also how we have to understand Genesis 46,10: \u05d5\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d4\u05db\u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea, \u201cand Sha-ul, son of a female merchant.\u201d According to Rabbi Nechemyah\u2019s approach to the subject, there is no need for what sound like far fetched solutions to our problem. The word \u05db\u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9 or \u05db\u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea in either of the verses that bothered us, are simply understood as elsewhere in the Bible, as people of Canaanite descent. We do have a problem if we accept Rabbi Yehudah\u2019s interpretation, an interpretation lacking specific sources in the written text. The Talmud, tractate Yumah folio 28, states that Avaraham had voluntarily observed all the commandments in the written and oral Torah, even including the rabbinic commandment known as eyruv tavshilin, a method of how to prepare food when the day after a festival is a Sabbath, and preparation of food on the festival for the Sabbath is not admissible. He is also supposed to have observed the law of yibbum, marrying the widow of a brother who died without having ever had any children. (Compare Genesis 38,8) where Yehudah, Er\u2019s father, gave Er\u2019s widow Tamar to Onan, his brother, as a wife, in order for him to become posthumously and vicariously a father. If these laws were operative prior to the Torah having been revealed at Mount Sinai to the Jewish people, how could Yaakov have married two sisters while the first sister had still been alive? Also, how could any of the sons of Yaakov have married their sisters? We could answer that although these laws were already known by tradition since Avraham\u2019s time, they had not become obligatory until after revealed at Mount Sinai. Our forefathers were free to choose the parts of the commandments they wished to observe voluntarily even they had been privy to them through the Holy Spirit. When the Talmud in Pessachim, folio 119, tells us that in the future (afterlife) at the meal prepared by G\u2019d for the righteous, that when Yaakov was being honoured presiding over the grace after the meal, he declined the honour, saying that seeing he had wed two sisters while both were alive, he was not worthy of that honour. Clearly he considered what he had done as having been improper. It is possible to argue that having been aware that what he had done would qualify for a penalty if he would do so after the revelation at Mount Sinai, he felt that he deserved at least a minor penalty. If he decided in favour of committing an act deserving of a minor penalty, he did so because he wished to marry only wives who were personally righteous, and these were hard to find, especially considering the age at which he had a chance to get married. As it turned out, even one of these two sisters who was a righteous woman did not by herself bore for him all the twelve tribes.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05da \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5, \u201chis father wept for him (losing him).\u201d According to Rashi, the word: \u201chis father,\u201d in this verse refers to Yitzchok, Yaakov\u2019s father. He was however, not mourning him as he knew that Joseph was still alive. He did not want to reveal this to Yaakov out of respect for G\u2019d, who had not seen fit to reveal this to his son. (B\u2018reshit Rabbah 84,21) Rashi had already explained that the brothers had sworn a solemn oath one to another not to reveal what they had done Joseph to anyone, and they had included G\u2019d in that oath of theirs. When, after 22 years they came to Egypt and found Joseph alive, they cancelled this oath. This released G\u2019d also, and that is why the Torah wrote that upon hearing that Joseph was alive and well, the bothers\u2019 father Yaakov \u201crevived,\u201d i.e. again was blessed with Holy Spirit. (Genesis 45,27). From this verse it is clear that ever since Joseph\u2019s disappearance he had not enjoyed the presence of the Holy Spirit. From this entire chapter we learn and can prove that when an entire congregation unanimously declares something or someone as \u201cbanished,\u201d and a single member of that congregation demurs by not accepting that decision, he is bound by the decision of the congregation, nonetheless. After all, Joseph had not been a party to the brothers\u2019 oath, and it had remained in force nonetheless. If Joseph had been part of that oath, the other brothers would not have had to include in their oath. They had been lacking Reuven and Binyamin to make up the necessary quorum by themselves. Although Joseph was aware of this, he did not wish to interfere with that oath by revealing his whereabouts to his father. The author promises to also provide an alternate reason why Joseph did not let his father know during all these years that he had been alive and well. If you were to argue that the ban into which the brothers had put the subject of the sale of Joseph was more stringent than an ordinary such ban where G\u2019d had not been co-opted as a partner, this is not a valid argument, as even nowadays whenever we make such a ban, we add the words: \u201cwith the consent of the Lord.\u201d We also find this approach to oaths in the Book of Samuel 14,24, where King Sha-ul had sworn that any man eating food before evening (the day of the battle) and the army had defeated their enemy, would be cursed, i.e. executed, that his own son Jonathan, who had tasted some honey, not having been aware that his father had pronounced such an oath, had become aware of someone having violated that oath, as one of the jewels in the breastplate of the High priest had suddenly lost part of its luster. Whenever a tribe performed a commandment, the jewel representing that tribe would shine more forcefully. When a tribe, or member of it, committed a trespass, its jewel would lose its luster. When King Sha-ul found out that the jewel representing his own tribe, that of Binyamin, suddenly did not shine anymore, he realised that the fault must lie with someone of his own tribe and family. He determined who that member of his tribe was by casting lots, as had done Joshua in Joshua 7, when he found out that the jewel representing the tribe of Yehudah had lost its luster. He had cast lots to determine which member of the tribe of Yehudah had been the guilty party. Achan, son of Karmi, was the one who had illegally pocketed some of the loot from the city of Jericho, and he was duly executed after having confessed.\n"}}, "34": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4, \u201cYehudah descended;\u201d our sages explained that this choice of words by the Torah means that Yehudah\u2019s brothers, who up until then had considered him as their leader and spokesman, demoted him on account of the sale of their brother Joseph and the anguish this had caused their father. (B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 85,1) Ibn Ezra questioned this, seeing that only twenty two years elapsed between the sale of Joseph and the reunification of the brothers with him and the family\u2019s moving to Egypt. We know that Joseph had been seventeen years old when he had been sold; we also know that he was thirty years old when he interpreted Pharaoh\u2019s dream; we further know that the family descended to Egypt in the second year of the famine, i.e. nine years after Joseph had been appointed viceroy of Egypt. If you count the years from the time Yehudah got married to the daughter of the man described earlier until the descent of the whole family with Yehudah at their head more than twenty two years must have passed. If we count a year each for the time Yehudah\u2019s wife was pregnant with each of her three sons, and add the years after Onan\u2019s death during which Shelah grew to maturity, i.e. was old enough to get married, you already have accounted for 16 years. Add a year till Peretz could have been born and you have accounted for already 17 years. Even if you were to assume that Peretz was no more than 7 years old when he became the father of Chetzron and another year for the birth of his brother Chamul, all of whom are listed in Genesis chapter 46 as having come to Egypt with Yaakov and Yehudah, you already have accounted for 25 years not 22. One would have to say that when Shelah was described as having \u201cgrown\u201d up, the Torah refers to his having become 9 years old, at which age it is possible to produce semen fit to sire a child. We can find support for this from the Talmud, tractate Niddah, folio 45, where the Mishnah discusses a nine year old who performed the levirate marriage ceremony on his sister-in-law whose husband had died without having had any children, that he cannot give such a sister-in-law a decree of divorce until he reaches the age of 13, as a minor cannot divorce his wife. Moreover, the original marriage of his deceased brother had been a marriage in the full sense of the word, and what he did was only to substitute for his deceased brother, so that any divorce cannot be less complete than that. According to an opinion quoted in the Talmud tractate Sanhedrin, folio 69, there were periods in former eras when seven year old males were able to impregnate females with their semen.\n", "1": "\u05d5\u05ea\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5, \u201cshe called his name Shelah, as he (her husband) was in a place called Keziv at the time when she gave birth to him.\u201d (standard explanation) The expression \u201cshelah\u201d and \u201ckeziv,\u201d are identical in meaning. They appear in connection with inability to give birth, such as in Kings II 4,16 when the woman from Shunem being promised by the prophet Elisha that she would give birth to a son tells him not raise false hopes as she knew she was past the age when this was possible. The words she used were \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05db\u05d6\u05d1.

(verse 28 in the same chapter) The word \u05db\u05d6\u05d1 meaning interruption in the sense of termination, also occurs in Isaiah 58,11: \u05d5\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0 \u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05db\u05d6\u05d1\u05d5, \u201clike a spring whose waters do not fail.\u201d According to this, the name shelah indicated that his mother knew she would not bear any more children. [This leaves the question of why the masculine \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4, \u201che was,\u201d is used in our verse Ed.] My teacher told me that \u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05d1 is the place of a town or village. It was customary in those days that mother and father named their children alternately. The father would name the firstborn, so that it would have been Yehudah\u2019s turn to name the son born third. Seeing that he was not at home when this son was born, the mother decided to name him instead. This is why the Torah explains why Yehudah had not named Shelah.\n", "2": "\u05d1\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7 \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, this expression may be understood as we know from the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio,10, where Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmeni understands it as giving a reason for her apparently inappropriate behaviour, when Yehudah first asked her about her personal status; she said that she was not married, was a widow, that she was ritually pure, and quite unattached to any other man when she had married, and that even then she was not anyone\u2019s daughter-in-law. [The marriage had not been consummated. Ed.]", "3": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4, \u201che considered her as a harlot.\u201d Why should Yehudah have cared? He turned around to resume on his way to the shearing. However, Tamar raised her face to heaven to pray and ask G\u2019d why she should not be able to give birth to a worthwhile and intelligent son from the semen of such a righteous man as Yehudah. Upon hearing her prayer, G\u2019d immediately dispatched the angel Michael who made Yehudah have second thoughts and turn around. The Torah here wrote: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4, \u201che turned to her,\u201d and we find the same expression in Numbers 22,33 where it is written of Bileam\u2019s she-ass: \u05d5\u05ea\u05d8 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9, \u201cshe turned around before me;\u201d (the angel speaking to Bileam) in both instances the angel Michael was the subject. (subject discussed in B\u2019reshit Rabbah 85,8)", "4": "\u05d5\u05ea\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dd \u05ea\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05df, \u201cshe said: \u2018if you will give me a pledge;\u2019\u201d some commentators claim that Yehudah did not sleep with Tamar until after he had given her a token to serve as a marriage betrothal. They interpret her question above as her asking for such a token. It was meant to mean: \u201cwhat kind of token of your intention to wed me are you going to give me?\u201d Yehudah\u2019s answer was that he would send her a young goat. Thereupon she asked for a guarantee that he would indeed send that goat. By insisting that he would give her his signet ring she meant that this would be her wedding ring. According to Rabbi Moshe, this whole interpretation is difficult to accept as the handing over of such a token requires the presence and confirmation by two witnesses in good standing as spelled out in the Talmud, tractate Kiddushin folio 65. Some people claim that an important person such as Yehudah would never travel except in the company of at least two people who could qualify as witnesses, just as a Torah scholar in our time does not travel alone and that therefore the betrothal of Tamar had been duly witnessed. If you were to counter that the betrothal was still invalid as she had never received the promised goat from him, and the Talmud in Kiddushin folio 8 states that even if the suitor gave the bride a token worth a p\u2019rutah (smallest copper coin) as a pledge to cover the remainder, such a betrothal is not legally valid. We would therefore have to say that he gave her his signet ring not as a pledge, but as an outright gift at that time. After having done so, he told her that when he would send her the goat he expected her to return his ring. This is how, in my opinion, the author of the above interpretation must have meant it.\n", "5": {"0": "\u05d6\u05e0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05ea\u05de\u05e8 \u05db\u05dc\u05ea\u05da, \u201cyour daughter-in-law Tamar has committed an act of adultery.\u201d Why did the informant have to add that Tamar had also become pregnant as a result of her act of adultery? Perhaps we can answer that in that era when acts of adultery did not result in the woman becoming pregnant as a result, no legal proceedings were instituted against her. Alternately, proceedings used to be instituted after such a woman had committed adulterous acts with more than one individual.", "1": "\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3, \u201ctake her outside so that she may be burned.\u201d Ephrayim from Kahse, (location) says that Tamar was the daughter of Shem who we heard was the priest of Shalem, and as such if she had committed adultery while still in her father\u2019s house, if sentenced to death for harlotry would die by burning; (Leviticus 21,9) (compare also B\u2019reshit Rabbah 85,10). Yehudah\u2019s judgment is hard to understand as there had been no witnesses to the adultery Tamar had been accused of. Neither had she been warned not to commit such an act and been advised of the potential penalty, as is required by Jewish law. Rabbi Joseph, a resident of the land of Israel, answered this by saying that the generation in which Yehudah lived was morally deprived, and in such circumstances warnings and witnesses are dispensed with when her pregnancy was proof enough of how it had come about. In times like that, the Torah applies additional measures to counteract serious crimes as no one would commit such acts in the presence of acceptable witnesses and after being warned. Rabbi Joseph based himself on the Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin folio 46, where we read as follows: \u201cRabbi Eliezer son of Yaakov said that the Jewish Court is authorized to decree death penalties not according to the legislation of the Torah when the circumstances demand it, in order to be deterrents to potential sinners.\u201d The Talmud quotes several historical instances when this occurred, including the carrying out of a death penalty against 80 witches on a single day, in spite of the generally accepted rule not to carry out more than one such sentence per day. This happened already during the first hundred years of the period of the second Temple. Joshua\u2019s executing Achan ben Karmi for stealing from the loot of Jericho, obviously without witnesses, why else had lots to be cast to find the guilty party, (Joshua chapter 7) is further proof of the authority of the leader appointed by G\u2019d in circumstances that are not normal. We are still left with the problem that if Tamar was indeed the daughter of Shem, and according to the historical data given to us by the Torah for the time when her father died, this occurred long before the sons of Yehudah were born, how could Yehudah have told her to return to the house of her father and spend there the years of her widowhood there? (Genesis 38,11) [According to the chronology of the Torah, Shem was born about 1557 after Adam was created, and died at the age of 500, i.e. in .2007 after the creation of Adam. Avraham was born in the year 1949 after the creation of Adam, he sired Yitzchak 100 years later. Yitzchok was 60 years old when he fathered Yaakov and Esau, and Yaakov was at least 88 years old when he fathered Yehudah, Tamar\u2019s father in law. You, the reader do not need a calculator to understand the problem created by Rabbi Joseph quoted by our author. Ed.] He must have meant that \u201cher father\u2019s house,\u201d was not to be understood literally, but he meant the family from which she stemmed.\n"}, "6": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d9, he (Yehudah) said: \u201cshe is more righteous than I am. \u201dG\u2019d\u2019s methods when sitting in judgment cannot be compared to the way a human judge deals with offenders. When a human judge tries a case, and the accused party admits his guilt, the judge proceeds to carry out the penalty for the offence in question, having proven that he did not act arbitrarily. In other words, if the offence carries the death penalty, it is carried out forthwith. According to Proverbs 28,13, this is not G\u2019d\u2019s way of dealing with the guilty party Solomon describes it as: \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05d6\u05d1 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd, \u201cif he confesses and abandons sin, he will experience mercy.\u201d As soon as Yehudah\u2019s brother Reuven heard about how he had publicly acknowledged being the father of Tamar\u2019s unborn children, he himself acknowledged his guilt in defiling his father\u2019 couch. (Yaakov\u2019s words in Genesis 49,4) This is also what Eliphas said to Job (Job 15,18) \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05db\u05d7\u05d3\u05d5 \u05de\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd, \u201cthat which the wise men have transmitted from their fathers and have not withheld it.\u201d The wise men that Job referred to are none other than Yehudah and Reuven. This is why the descendants of those two sons of Yaakov were the only ones whose territory was never invaded by aliens [prior to the building of Solomon\u2019s Temple? Ed.] (compare Moses\u2019 blessing in Deuteronomy 33, 6-7)", "1": " \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5, the meaning is as per Targum, i.e. \u201cshe has become pregnant from me.\u201d We are puzzled by this commentary, as if true, the sin of sleeping with one\u2019s father-in-law is far greater than that of sleeping with a total stranger. We must assume therefore, that prior to the giving of the Torah, the way the system of the Levirate marriage was practiced was that in the absence of the deceased husband of the widow having any siblings, another close family member would perform that rite with the widow in order to ensure that the name of the deceased would be preserved thereby. Yehudah\u2019s statement at the time when Tamar explained her complaint that she had not been given as a wife to Shelah, must therefore be explained as follows: \u201cactually, seeing that at the time Onan died Shelah was not yet old enough to perform these rites it was my duty to have done so, especially as I could not be sure he would do so even when he would grow up.\u201d At the time when Yehudah, through sleeping with Tamar had actually fulfilled the required rite though not having been aware of it, G\u2019d said to him: \u201cby doing so you saved four lives from death. One was saved from dying in a pit and three were saved from dying by being burned to death. This is based on Daniel 1,6: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9  \u05d1\u05d4\u05dd \u05de\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc, \u05d7\u05e0\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4, \u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d0\u05dc, \u05d5\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4, there were among them from the descendants of Yehudah: \u2018Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael and Azaryah.\u2019 The verse does not trace their ancestry to Chizkiyah, but to Yehudah. Daniel was saved from a pit, the other three from a fiery furnace. An alternate explanation of the words: \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cshe became pregnant from me.\u201d Yehudah claimed that he had married her legally by betrothing her with his ring, as mentioned earlier in my commentary. Rabbi Moshe queries this interpretation claiming that such a betrothal is invalid when performed by the father-in-law. He bases himself on the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 10, the Talmud, quoting the dialogue between Yehudah and Tamar there claims that when Yehudah asked her about her marital status, including asking her whether perhaps her father had accepted a token of betrothal on her behalf, she responded by saying that this was impossible as she was an orphan. Rashi on the Talmud there explains that even if she had been betrothed by her father, had he lived, such a betrothal would have been invalid as she would have had to be a minor for such a betrothal to have any legal significance. She is quoted as having told Yehudah that she was completely and legally available and was not ritually impure either. At any rate, when the Torah subsequent to the revelations after the trial writes that Yehudah \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e1\u05e3 \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d4, this line has to be understood that he did not stop to have marital relations with her, as he had now found out that everything had been legal to begin with. (verse 26) According to our author this latest interpretation follows the view expressed in the Talmud tractate Yevamot folio 100, that even a woman with an infant on her shoulder is believed when she claims that her betrothal at the time had been illegal.

This is a reminder to the reader that the decree revealed to Avraham at the time that his descendants would have to be both strangers and at least part of the time, even slaves, in a foreign country, had now begun to be fulfilled. (Compare Genesis chapter 15)", "1": "If we view the history of the Jewish people by comparing it to a parable, it is comparable to a cow which its owner wanted to proceed to a slaughterhouse and the cow objected strenuously; what did the owner do to overcome that objection? He brought her calf to the slaughterhouse first. As soon as the cow saw that, it became anxious to join her calf. When Yaakov found out where Joseph had been taken, he immediately voiced the wish to join him there. (Compare B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 86,2)\n"}, "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 , \u201cand the Lord was with Joseph;\u201d the Midrash sees in this line a lesson for us to compare G\u2019d\u2019s method of befriending us to how human beings befriend their masters or superiors. As long as their superiors are successful and amass glory the underlings surround the king and flatter him nonstop. As soon however, as the king or master falls on hard times, his former \u201cfriends,\u201d and flatterers abandon him as they would a ship about to sink. The reverse is true of Hashem. As soon as Joseph fell on hard times, G\u2019d went out of His way to show him that far from having abandoned him, on the contrary, He now went out of His way to make life easier for him. He supported him when he became viceroy of Egypt for 80 years, as well as when he was still a slave in the house of Potiphar, and even when jailed for supposedly having tried to rape his wife. It is remarkable that also Joseph\u2019s way of responding to the way the brothers had treated him were quite different from the way ordinary people would have reacted to this given the chance. Normally, poor people display some fear of G\u2019d, as He is the only one from whom they can expect help. Joseph, even when in a position of power, repeatedly refused to do something that G\u2019d would not approve of (Compare Genesis 42,18 as well as 39,9) An alternate interpretation of the line: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3. Imagine someone blessed with ten children, each one of whom lives in a different country. Instead of visiting them all in rotation, he concentrated on spending time with the youngest, as he was less well endowed than his brothers, and depended more on advice and assistance from his father. Take another parable illustrating our subject. A wine merchant had loaded ten donkeys with barrels of wine and began to lead them on the public highway. Suddenly one donkey veered and entered the house of a pagan. Right away the owner abandoned all the other nine donkeys out of concern that a pagan might touch the wine on the back of the last mentioned animal and make it unfit for Jews to drink from. Similarly, as soon as G\u2019d saw that Joseph had been brought to the house of an Egyptian who was now his master, He hurried to supervise his fate to protect him from harm. He was afraid that unless He did so, Joseph might learn to copy the lifestyle of his master.\n", "2": "\u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4, \u201con everything that he owned, be it inside the house or out on the field.\u201d He made all his efforts inside the house successful during the winter when people are more or less housebound, and in the summer when most of their activities take place outdoors. Actually, Joseph worked in the house of Potiphar for only one year, after which he was put in jail as a result of the accusation against him by Potiphar\u2019s wife. (Seder Olam, chapter 2 Joseph spent a total of twelve years in jail.

(Compare Genesis 43,32, and verse 9 in this chapter, where Potiphar\u2019s wife is described as out of bounds to Joseph [similar to his bread. Joseph was not afraid to make this comparison. Ed.]", "4": {"0": "\u05d5\u05ea\u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5, \u201cshe grabbed him by his outer garment.\u201d According to Kohelet Rabbah on Kohelet 7,26, where the author describes a woman\u2019s hands as having been artificially restrained, \u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, the kind of woman described by Solomon there would grab men in the street and try and seduce them. Even the relatively chaste women are described there as aggressive in that respect. During the 12 months that Joseph was in Potiphar\u2019s house, he was exposed to those tactics by Potiphar\u2019s wife on a daily basis. When the Torah speaks of these ongoing attempts at seduction (verse 10) as occurring \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd, \u201cevery day,\u201d this must be considered as if Joseph had withstood a year\u2019s temptation. The word is used as meaning \u201cyear\u201d as in Esther 3,7. He would literally have to take evasive action, such as covering his face, practically shrinking to the ground. She would use instruments in order to force him to resume his normal posture. She would use the argument that she was not really married to Potiphar; he was a homosexual and had never consummated the \u201cmarriage.\u201d He had to explain to her that the Hebrews were not allowed to have sexual relations with Egyptian women even if the latter were unmarried. She would threaten him with having him consigned to jail. Joseph would reply that his G\u2019d had means of freeing him from jail. She would threaten to have him blinded, to which he replied that his G\u2019d could make the blind see. Eventually, if it had not been for the priests who testified hat the drops of semen she produced as evidence that he had tried to rape her were in fact not from a human being, he might have been sentenced to death. This eventually became the reason why he dealt so extraordinarily generously with the Egyptian priests during the years of the famine.

This appears difficult, as Rabbi Moshe, quoting the Talmud in tractate Sotah, folio 13 pointed out that the name Potiphar is spelled in the Torah once as \u05e4\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05e4\u05e8, (39,1) without the letter \u05e2 at the end, and on another occasion with that letter \u05e2 missing (37,36) The Talmud concludes that once he had become a eunuch, as a close servant of Pharaoh, he could not indulge in sexual activity, so that Rashi\u2019s commentary seems forced, to say the least. In fact, it is suggested that he bought Joseph in order to indulge in homosexual relations with him. Alternately, his castration had only been a partial one. Ibn Ezra explains that there are indeed two types of castration. One is called a hot castration, the other a cold castration.

According to the Talmud, tractate B\u2019rachot, folio 55, where dreams are discussed at length, the Talmud states that G\u2019d does not send a dream to a person in which he is shown something that does not make any sense, such as an elephant passing through the eye of a needle. This statement is to be understood as an aggadah. The plain meaning of our verse is that Pharaoh believed he had seen the ears of corns being swallowed by their hollowed out counterparts. This is why the Torah had to add that when he awoke he realised that he had not seen something real, but that it was a dream in which one does see such things. Pharaoh could understand that cows eat each other, but he was baffled by ears of corn consuming one another. Hence he was convinced that he had only dreamt, although the dream was very vivid.", "3": " \u05d5\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5, \u201chis mind was disturbed.\u201d Rashi draws our attention to the fact that when the reaction of King Nebuchadnezzar to his dream is described in the Book of Daniel 2,1, the author uses a different conjugation, i.e. \u05d5\u05ea\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dd which is a combination of the passive and reflexive mode. [The latter could not even remember what he had seen that disturbed him so much. Ed.] His interpreters were required to tell him what he had dreamt as well as what it meant. Pharaoh, on the other hand, had only forgotten the interpretation of what he had seen in the dream. (B\u2018reshit Rabbah, 89,5.) Even though when relating his dream to potential interpreters he did not let on how deeply he was troubled and he used the same words for his reaction as are reported of Pharaoh, \u05d7\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d7\u05dc\u05de\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9, \u201cI have dreamt a dream and my mind is disturbed,\u201d (Daniel 2,3) the difference was that the inability of his interpreters to offer any interpretation was due to the fact that they had not been told what he had dreamt. One of the differences between the two dreams was that Nebuchadnezzar dreamt something that would occur in the distant future, whereas Pharaoh dreamt something that would occur almost immediately. If Daniel had not been able to tell Nebuchadnezar what he had dreamt, he would never have believed the interpretation that Daniel offered him. Seeing that Joseph interpreted Pharaoh\u2019s dream as predicting matters that would occur in the immediate future, he believed him, as otherwise he could have called him a liar within a short time and have dealt with him as a false prophet. As to Nebuchadnezzar having meted out the death penalty to all the interpreters that had failed to interpret his dream, (compare Daniel 2,12) this was partly due to their having said that no human being could interpret his dream, only angels (verse 11). Prophets had been rare already in the time of Samuel; (compare Samuel 3,1) The word \u05d5\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9, in Daniel 2,11, should be read as \u05d5\u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05de\u05e6\u05d0, \u201cthere is no Aaron nowadays who by means of the urim and tumim in the folds of his breastplate could have secured an answer from G\u2019d to his query.\u201d Nebuchadnezzar, when hearing these words of Daniel, told him that he now remembered about the significance of that breastplate and the urim and tumim. He added that the Jewish people had lost their world because their priests had made unlawful use of that breastplate. This is why he decreed a similar fate for his own priests.

Twice seven when Pharaoh had the dream, once with the cows, once with the ears of corn. The same was repeated when he related his dream to his interpreters. It was repeated again when he related the dream to Joseph. Joseph\u2019s prayer achieved that the 42 years which had been decreed were shrunk to only seven years. The arrival of Joseph\u2019s father Yaakov in Egypt and his blessing to Pharaoh reduced the famine further so that it lasted only two years. The 40 years that were chopped off the decree did not disappear but were \u201cpaid back\u201d to Egypt in later years as we know from Jeremiah that Egypt experienced 40 years of total drought predicted by that prophet.

The author believes that linen was indeed grown in Egypt in larger quantities than elsewhere and that it was considered very valuable.

On the other hand, if he would agree and marry this woman, his former master would honour him henceforth, being proud that through this marriage he himself now had connections to the highest social circles in Egypt. There is an additional reason why he agreed to marry this woman, as she was actually a descendant of Yaakov, as Rashi has explained on Genesis, portion Vayishlach, quoting Pirke de rabbi Eliezer, chapter 38, according to which she was the daughter of Dinah from her rape by Sh\u2019chem. According to that chapter, the angel Michael had transported that infant to Egypt where she had been adopted by Potiphar. This is why the Torah calls her the daughter of Potiphar. We find that Moses similarly was adopted by the daughter of Pharaoh, and that in Chronicles I 4,18 Calev is reported as marrying (also) Bityah-the daughter of Pharaoh, who had at the time adopted Moses. When Joseph was paraded throughout Egypt (Genesis 49,23,) and according to the Torah, all the young ladies threw flowers or jewelry at him, when Ossnat, did not have anything to throw, she threw her amulet, which she had worn around her neck at all times, at him. When Joseph looked at the inscription on it, he realised that the girl wearing it was descended from Yaakov, and he went ahead and married her."}, "11": "\u05dc\u05e7\u05de\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cin fistfuls.\u201d Joseph\u2019s overseers took a fifth of a fistful, even of the last fistful remaining in the farmer\u2019s barn, as part of the grain to be stored for the future.", "12": "\u05d1\u05d8\u05e8\u05dd \u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e9\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d1, \u201cbefore the year of famine arrived.\u201d The Talmud in tractate Taanit folio 11 teaches that from this verse we learn that during a famine man and his wife are not to cohabit [so as not to add more hungry mouths at that time. Ed.] In light of this it is difficult to understand how Levi could have sired Yocheved during those years as we have been told that she was born when her mother entered Egypt on her way there with Yaakov\u2019s family. (Compare Genesis 45,6) Rabbi Yehudah hachassid, opined that the prohibition of cohabiting with one\u2019s wife during periods of famine is valid only for a prophet who has been told by G\u2019d directly that there was going to be such a famine. Joseph was such a prophet who had been inspired by G\u2019d to advise Pharaoh of future events. Levi who did not have any direct knowledge concerning the origin of this famine, and who had caused it, was therefore not obliged to abstain from the commandment to be fruitful and to multiply. According to a different interpretation, the brothers Levi and Joseph took different sides in an argument aired in the Talmud, tractate Yevamot folio 61 concerning that if the commandment to be fruitful has already been fulfilled if one has fathered two sons. A second opinion holds that until one has sired both a son and a daughter, one cannot claim to have fulfilled the commandment. Since Levi at this time had not yet sired a daughter, he had felt entitled to maintain normal family relations with his wife. Joseph had already sired two sons, and he held that thereby he had fulfilled the commandment.", "13": " \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201che called Ephrayim.\u201d This was a reminder of the two founding fathers of the Jewish people, Avraham and Yitzchok, both of whom had described themselves as ashes, \u05d0\u05e4\u05e8.

Did G\u2019d not make the whole body? Why did he single out the ear and the eye? The answer is that all parts of the body, in due course, will have to give an accounting for their activities while they were alive on earth, except the ear and the eye. What is the reason for this? The eye sees things which are not good for it to see, and so does the ear hear things which are not good for it to hear. [involuntary perceptions. Ed.] This is not true of the other organs or limbs. You choose what the mouth eats, etc., you choose where your legs are to take you, etc. Rabbi said that the words: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, \u201cYaakov saw,\u201d although he was an old man sitting hundreds of miles away, what his ten sons who were going in and out and meeting all kinds of people, did not see. All this was although both Yaakov and Joseph had been blessed with the spirit of prophecy. Joseph was only a distance of 4 or 5 days travel away from them, and when they searched for him they did not find him. Furthermore, why did Joseph not communicate with his father during all these years which would have spared his father a great deal of grief? The answer is that they all had sworn a sacred oath not to reveal to their father that he was in Egypt. They had made G\u2019d a partner to their oath, so that He too could not reveal their secret to him. All this can be proved from Scripture, when before revealing himself to his brothers (Genesis 45,1) he commanded that all the people around him remove themselves before he would have that conversation with his brothers. He did not want that anyone would ever hear about that oath which had now expired. Other commentators offer a different reason for why Joseph had not communicated with his father for 22 years. As long as he had been a slave (13 years) he did not want to increase his father\u2019s grief by informing him of his sorry condition. If he were to end a message that in the meantime he had become a king, his father would not believe him; he was right as his father did not even believe this when all his sons told that they had seen it with their own eyes. (Genesis 45,26) In addition, he was afraid that if his father were to leak his new found knowledge to someone, the brothers would each flee in all directions out of fear of his vengeance. As a result, his father would experience additional grief. This is why he waited until the time would be ripe for him to reveal himself, so that he would first reveal himself to his brothers before informing his father of his survival and the good fortune which had befallen him.", "1": " \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3, \u201cwe are all the sons of the same father.\u201d How was this revelation an appropriate answer to the accusation that they were spies?

(Compare Genesis 25,22, when his mother was distraught and asked G\u2019d what was going on inside her womb.) The sages concluded that the two as yet unborn children had already struggled for possession of two worlds.

He lists them during the encounter with Lavan. (Genesis 31,40) Esau then came towards him in order to attack him, As a result he lost a great deal of the wealth he had acquired by buying him off with a gift. Next his best loved wife died on the way and he could not even bury her in the ancestral gravesite. Next his daughter Dinah was raped, and then his beloved son Joseph was lost. When he felt that finally he could settle down to a normal life in one place, (Genesis 37,1) the problems with Joseph began. During the brothers\u2019 first trip to Egypt Shimon, his second oldest son was incarcerated and he now had to Shimon being incarcerated and his sons forced him to allow Binyamin to travel to Egypt in order to secure the release of Shimon. He could have said, as did Job in Job 3,26: \u201cI had no repose, no quiet no rest; trouble came.\u201d (Based on Tanchuma on our portion, section 10.) In light of all this, Yaakov now called on that attribute of G\u2019d to signal that he felt he had undergone sufficient tribulations, i.e. \u05d3\u05d9, to warrant a favourite response to his blessing/prayer.", "1": " \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3, \u201cthe man did as Joseph had said. According to our sages, the \u201cman\u201d was his older son Menashe, [who could not have been more than nine years old at the time. Ed.] This is difficult in light of Rashi\u2019s commentary in the Talmud Avot chapter 5, that the rule that men have to observe the Torah\u2019s commandments from the age of 13, is derived from Shimon and Levi, Joseph\u2019s brothers when we calculate their ages at the time when they took their swords and killed the male population of the town of Sh\u2019chem. (Genesis 34,25) If they were 13 at the time, it is clear that Menashe at this time could not have been older than nine years old. The Torah had spelled out that Joseph\u2019s sons had been born before the onset of the famine. Seven years had elapsed since Joseph had married, seven good years and 2 years of famine. How could the Torah refer to Menashe as a \u201cman\u201d then? (Attributed to Rav Chayim who quoted Rabbi Eliezer avi ha-ezri.)

The brothers, answering about their father being alive did not want to mention the negative event of their grandfather having died. We find something similar in the Talmud, tractate Pessachim, folio 4, where when Rav was asked if his father was still alive he responded by saying that his mother was alive.

Joseph\u2019s messenger said that he would be more generous with them than they would be with themselves if it turned out that they were not guilty.

(Compare how Joseph is described in Psalms 105,17-18)", "1": "\u05d2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9, \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05e9\u05d5, \u201cplease come physically closer to me; they did so.\u201d Seeing that prior to this Joseph had ordered everybody in the hall with them to leave the hall, (45,1) and the Egyptians outside now trying very hard to listen to what went on inside, Joseph now tried to put more physical distance between them and himself and the brothers. He did not mind them to hear him ask the brothers: \u201cis my father still alive?\u201d He did not want them to hear the words: \u201cyou have sold me,\u201d however, in order not to embarrass them publicly, and because he intended to settle Yaakov\u2019s whole family in Egypt. If his employees had heard him refer to this, they would have objected to such wicked people settling in Egypt. They would conclude that if these people had been capable of selling their own brother, how much worse would they deal with Egyptian neighbours that were not related to them by blood? This is why he asked them to step closer so that the balance of the conversation could be conducted in whispers. An alternate interpretation: first Joseph told his brothers that he was their brother; next he asked if his father was still alive; He did not want to raise the subject of their having sold him in the presence of his brother Binyamin who had been unaware of that. He knew that this would greatly embarrass his brothers, and that Binyamin upon hearing of this would surely report it to their father. He therefore motioned the brothers to move over so that he could continue the conversation where Binyamin could not overhear it.

According to Rashi, Joseph conveyed to his father a code word that would convince him that only he could have known this. It concerned the subject matter that his father and he had been discussing when he accompanied him part of the way on his fateful journey. It dealt with someone being found dead on the road, someone whom no one knew and who had nothing on him that could identify him. This subject is discussed in chapter 21.of the Book of Deuteronomy. The hint was contained in the translation of the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d4\u05d5, \u201che sent him off,\u201d which the Targum renders in Genesis 12,20 when Pharaoh sent Avraham home as \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5, \u201che gave him safe conduct.\u201d Joseph had at the time told his father to go home, to which Yaakov had replied that it was a virtuous act to accompany someone departing some distance. He acquainted him at the time with the paragraph quoted from Deuteronomy chapter 21. He even pointed out the fact that failing to accompany a departing guest some distance, could make such a person liable to have to swear a sacred oath that he had not been negligent in this respect. The subject is discussed in the Talmud tractate Sotah chapter nine at length, where it is presumed that the word \u05e2\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea was supposed to refer to the heifer that would be the animal offered as atonement for this sin of negligence by the townspeople closest to the murdered person. Other commentators believe that what Yaakov and Joseph had been discussing was the subject of a carriage being pulled by a heifer (compare Sotah, folio 46.) In either event, it seems very forced to see in the carriages Joseph had sent to carry Yaakov\u2019s family a reference to the word \u05e2\u05d2\u05dc\u05d4, heifer. It is more plausible that the hint had to do with the carriages used by the Jewish people to transport the parts of the Tabernacle that could not be carried on the shoulders of the Levites.

Ed.] Now Pharaoh had relented and instructed Joseph to bring his family to Egypt by means of carriages. This turnaround convinced Yaakov that he and his family would be welcome in Egypt. He realised that such a command could only have been given by Pharaoh himself. [He had attributed antisemitic feeling in Egypt as dating back to when his grandmother had almost been raped there, had G\u2019d not interfered.

An alternate interpretation: Yaakov\u2019s children kept on telling their father about Joseph\u2019s position in Egypt, until their father got tired of listening to this and tried to stop them by saying: \u05e8\u05d1, \u201cenough,\u201d I now know that my son Joseph is still alive.

Proof for this interpretation is the fact that although 70 of his descendants have been mentioned as coming to Egypt, only sixty nine names have been listed, i.e. G\u2019d Himself is considered as making up the seventieth. (Compare Deuteronomy 10,22) When the Israelites eventually would leave Egypt there was also one missing to make up the number 600000, this \u2018one\u2019 being G\u2019d.\u201d [This is why no precise number was quoted in Exodus 12,37 for the number of males that left Egypt, although on several counts in the desert, each time a precise number of the adult males is given.

This sounds peculiar as it does not explain who Yaakov\u2019s \u201cdaughters (pl)\u201d were. We have been told only about one daughter Dinah, born for him by Leah. She was the only daughter listed as descending to Egypt. The twin daughters born to him had all died before that time. Leah\u2019s descendants numbered 33 as stated explicitly. (verse 15) It is possible to include daughters-in-law, but those were not included in the count.

The word \u201cYaakov\u201d in this verse is superfluous unless it was meant to include him in the count.

Not only that, it was certainly fitting that the founding father should be included in the first of the four groups of people counted. If you wanted to know the precise number of Yaakov\u2019s family in Egypt i.e. seventy, counting Joseph and his family, [assuming Joseph\u2019s wife was Dinah\u2019s offspring Ed.] this is how it was composed.

Alternately, the reason why he is described as ascending, is that the province of Goshen is situated on a higher plateau than the Nile delta in which most of the Egyptians dwelt. Goshen borders on the land of Israel which is a land of many hills and mountains. This is also clear from Joshua 15,49-51.

This is also why they could not sit at the same table as the Hebrews when the latter were being served lamb. They harboured a deep aversion for anyone stemming from the Euphrates-Tigris region. They considered the Sumerians as a lower class of human beings.

They would risk being stoned by them. It is interesting that they did not refer to being just killed, but they spelled out by which method they would be killed, a method which in Jewish law is the most severe kind of death penalty.

An explanation by the Midrash of this strange sounding conversation between the ruler of the civilised world at the time and Joseph\u2019s father: As soon as Yaakov had uttered the words that his life compared unfavourably with that of his father and grandfather, G\u2019d told him \u201cI have saved you from Esau and Lavan, I restored your daughter Dinah to you, as well as your son Joseph, and you have the nerve to describe your life on earth in negative terms when speaking to Pharaoh? I am now forced to make sure that you did not tell a lie, by shortening your lifespan when compared to that of your father and grandfather. He therefore deducted a year for each of the words in this reply by Yaakov, i.e. 33 words, so that he died at 147 years, 33 years younger than the lifespan of his father who had lived for 180 years.

[He adds that an alternate explanation is that seeing he was about to reveal parts of the future to his children, G\u2019d immediately deprived him of his prophetic insights, preventing him form carrying out his wish. Ed.] The difficulty with Rashi\u2019s first explanation is that Joseph\u2019s rule in Egypt continued for another 54 years, during which period the Jews enjoyed preferred social status. Also, how do we know that Yaakov had at all been privy to what would happen to his descendants after his death, and when? We would have to answer that in his dream of the ladder he watched the ascension of that ladder by the guardian angel of brother Esau, as Rashi had explained in his commentary of B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 68,12, and as we know from Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 35.", "1": "'\u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5, \u201cWhy did the Torah mention the number of years that Yaakov lived in Egypt?

He had no reason to fear that his remains would be affected by that plague, seeing that we have a tradition that even his son Binyamin was not affected by that plague; his father Yaakov surely would be even less affected by it. (Talmud tractate Baba Batra folio 17) In order for Rashi to be correct, we would have to assume that Yaakov was unaware that his son Binyamin and his descendants would not be afflicted by these lice, something that seems unlikely. One of Rashi\u2019s grandsons, Rash\u2019bam, claims that Yaakov wanted to prevent the Egyptians of being spared the ten plagues seeing that he had been buried in that soil. This would be due to his having been named Yisrael, which conferred a much higher spiritual status on him. (Compare Jeremiah 50,17 where he has been referred to as \u05e9\u05d4 \u05e4\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, \u201ca scattered sheep,\u201d as opposed to the Egyptians who are referred to by several of our prophets as donkeys, i.e. their flesh being described as similar to the flesh of donkeys. (Ezekiel 23,20) The Torah writes that the firstborn male donkey has to be redeemed by a \u05e9\u05d4, i.e. a sheep or lamb (Exodus 13,13) the implication being that only descendants of Yaakov can possibly serve as redemption for Egyptians. If that animal is not redeemed, it must be killed by its owner.

We find that Joseph indeed made his brothers swear that his remains would be taken with the Israelites at the time of the redemption, and Moses personally, was involved in locating his coffin which was carried with the Israelites for 40 years until eventually being interred near Sh\u2019chem in the tribal territory of Ephraim, one of his sons. He used the same formula when making his request as had his father at the time. (Compare Genesis 50,24-26) The choice of the Torah describing Joseph\u2019s response as \u201cthe words of\u201d instead of simply \u201chis request,\u201d or something similar, is why Rashi (in Exodus 3,18) says that before Moses came to Egypt and introduced himself as the redeemer, G\u2019d told him that the elders would listen to him as he introduced himself with the words: \u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3, that Joseph had used at the time when he stood at his father\u2019s deathbed and they spoke about the eventual redemption, long before even the enslavement had commenced. This was also the reason why Yaakov had used this formula for describing the redemption."}, "44": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3, \u201che said to Joseph;\u201d according to our sages, the subject in this verse was Ephrayim, who informed his father of Yaakov\u2019s illness; (Tanchuma section 6 on this portion) Rabbi Moshe adds that there is an oblique hint of this in the text, seeing that the letters in the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 and the word \u05d0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd when reading the alphabet backwards, starting with the letter \u05ea, are in the relative same position as when read from the right to left, i.e. the letter \u05d5 in the word \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 is the sixth letter in the alphabet when read from right to left, whereas the letter \u05e4 is in the sixth place when the alphabet is read from left to right commencing with the latter \u05ea. (the other letters are identical) What we learn from this is that whereas Joseph was not a frequent visitor in the province of Goshen where his father resided, his sons spent much more of their time with their grandfather, so that they were aware of any changes in the state of his health.

I have heard from Rabbi Sh\u2019muel of blessed memory that the reason that Joseph did not frequently visit his father was that he was afraid that Yaakov would ask him how he had come to be in Egypt in the first place, in which case he would have had to tell him that his brothers had sold him, etc., as a result of which his father would have cursed the brothers. This in turn would have spelled the destruction of the civilised world, seeing that when he had cursed Rachel quite unintentionally, Rachel died prematurely as a result, although the teraphim of Lavan had never even been found.

When you look at the consecration rites for the Tabernacle in the desert, in Numbers 7,48, you will find that the prince of Ephrayim presented his offering ahead of the tribe of Menashe, who did so only in verse 54 of that chapter. In this way the statement in Isaiah 44,26, that G\u2019d fulfils the words of his servant, was fulfilled. (B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 97,5)", "8": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05da, \u201cI have given (allocated) to you;\u201d Rabbi Moshe raises the point that Yaakov was directly responsible for fuelling jealousy between the brothers, commencing already with giving his son Joseph a garment that was visibly more expensive than those worn by his brothers. On account of this error in judgment, the whole family descended to Egypt, only to become enslaved for hundreds of years after initially having been welcomed there. (Compare Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 10) We must also marvel that Joseph followed in his father\u2019s footsteps by giving his full brother Binyamin far more valuable gifts than he gave to his other brothers (Genesis 45,22). In order to answer these questions we must remember that what Yaakov gave to Joseph was done while he was relatively young and immature, younger than 17 years old, an age at which Ishmael in Genesis 21,14 has still been described by the Torah as a \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3, \u201ca child;\u201d at that time the brothers who were jealous of him had reason to be so. What had he done to deserve preferential treatment by his father? Now that his dreams had come true, not only did they not feel jealous of him, but they were grateful and proud of his achievements. Moreover, they had become economically dependent upon him. Even if he had not treated them well, they were legally obligated to honour him on account of his position. If he gave Binyamin more gifts, that was easily explained by the fact that he was his only full brother. However, what bothers me is that at a time when he had not yet revealed to the brothers who he was, (Genesis 43,34) the brothers of Binyamin must have asked themselves for the reason that this ruler of Egypt who had \u2013according to their assumption- never previously laid eyes on Binyamin, should have given him five times as much as he gave to them. Surely, this would have aroused the other brothers\u2019 jealousy of Binyamin. However, the brothers found a reason for this also, as they considered it as Joseph compensating Binyamin for having insisted that he make the journey to Egypt just because he had not trusted the brothers\u2019 statement that he even existed. Furthermore, I believe that Joseph, already at that point, had decided to reveal his true identity. He was certain that as soon as they would find out that he, Joseph, was a full brother of Binyamin, they would not begrudge him the additional gifts. Some commentators explain the words: \u05e9\u05db\u05dd \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3, in our verse, the extra portion of ancestral parts of the land of Israel, allocated by Yaakov to Joseph, as referring to the grave in that city in which the remains of Joseph would be interred after the Israelites taking over that country. (Compare Joshua 24,32) The matter can be compared to a parable of thieves who had robbed the owner of a vineyard of a full casket of wine when they were found out by the owner. That owner asked the thieves to do him one favour; seeing that they had already emptied the casket of its contents he asked them to at least return the empty casket to him. Joseph had been sold in Sh\u2019chem. The time had come to at least bring his remains back there. (Compare B\u2019reshit Rabbah, 85,3)."}, "45": {"0": {"0": " \u05d4\u05d0\u05e1\u05e4\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05dc\u05db\u05dd, \u201cgather around so that I can tell you, etc.;\u201d in the next verse we read \u05d4\u05e7\u05d1\u05e6\u05d5 \u05d5\u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d5, \u201cassemble and listen!\u201d Here Yaakov is about to tell his sons that they will go into exile.

In this respect you are comparable to water, the first physical element in the universe. You are the original, (oldest) of the people that make up the Israelite nation, the 12 tribes.\u201d Water is insubstantial; it cannot be poured out completely, as opposed to something dry which can be emptied without the loss of any part of it.

They appointed an agent and instructed him: \u201cgo and purchase for us one hundred measures of oil.\u201d The agent first came to Jerusalem and was told \u201cgo to Tyre.\u201d He came to Tyre, and was told: \u201cgo to Gush halab.\u201d When he came to Gush Halab, he was told to go to a certain farmer on a certain field. He went there and found the farmer breaking up the earth around his olive trees. When he asked the farmer if he had a hundred measures of oil, he was told that the farmer did have it. He was asked, however, to wait until the farmer had completed the work he was engaged in. After the farmer had finished his work, he threw down his tools and went on his way, removing any stones that were in his way. The agent thought to himself: \u201chas this man really the quantity of oil that I wish to purchase?\u201d He thought that the Jews had tried to make a fool of him. As soon as he reached his hometown, that man\u2019s maidservant brought out a bowl of hot water and he washed his hands and feet. She then brought out to him a golden bowl of oil, and he dipped in it his hands and feet, thus fulfilling the verse \u201cand let him dip his feet in oil.\u201d (Deuteronomy 33,24, Moses\u2019 blessing of Asher) After they had eaten and drunk, the man measured out to the agent a hundred measures of oil, and he asked the agent, if per chance he could use more than that. The agent replied in the affirmative, but added that he had not brought enough money with him for the extra amount. The man said that he would give it to him and would accompany him to his home where he could pay him. He proceeded to measure out for the agent another eighteen thousand measures of oil. It is reported that he hired every horse, mule, camel and ass in the land of Israel. When he reached his hometown, all the people came out and applauded him.\u201d Do not applaud me,\u201d he said; applaud this man, my companion, who measured out for me a hundred measures worth of oil, and to whom I still owe for eighteen thousand measures of oil.

Another interpretation: the subject here is Naftali himself, and refers to Naftali giving thanks to his Creator for having been given the chance to escape the net. Still another interpretation: the territory of Naftali can be compared to that of a doe after it had been skinned, its skin not having stuck to its flesh so that it could be put to good use while still intact.

During the lifetime of their father they had thought it best not to resurrect old hatreds, etc. they assumed that the past had been buried. When they had passed the pit into which they had thrown Joseph they observed how Joseph recited the blessing appropriate for people who had been the witness and beneficiaries of Divine miracles. When they saw this, they were afraid that he had not forgiven them for the past.", "3": " ?\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9, the word \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea here must be understood as in Deuteronomy, 1,21: \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea, \u201cdo not be afraid!\u201d When Joseph realised the fear of the brothers that he would now take revenge on them he was broken hearted, telling them that he was far too G\u2019d fearing, to act in such a manner.", "4": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05d1\u05dd, \u201che addressed their hearts trying to put them at ease.\u201d According to Rashi, he used logic to convince them of his sincerity, by saying that if ten lamps had not been able to extinguish one lamp, how could he a single (lamp) individual, hope to extinguish ten lamps? He referred to the smoke emanating from the fire in each lamp.", "5": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5....\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3, \u201cJoseph spoke to his brothers and he made them swear an oath;\u201d It is difficult to understand why Joseph repeated the words \u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3. We would have expected him to say: \u201cwhen G\u2019d will remember you and take you out of Egypt, take my remains with you.\u201d This would have been parallel to Yaakov\u2019s last request from his son Joseph.\u201d (Compare Genesis 47,30) We may be correct in assuming that the first time he used the expression \u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3, this was meant as a reference to how Yaakov his father had introduced a similar request.", "1": "\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cG\u2019d will most certainly remember you, etc.\u201d The numerical value of the letters in the word \u05e4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 is 190. It was meant as a hint that G\u2019d would shorten the decree according to which the people would have to wait 400 years for their redemption by 190 years. As a result, they would have spent only 210 years in Egypt at the time of the Exodus. The root \u05e4\u05e7\u05d3 has been used as meaning \u201cto be absent\u201d (in the passive mode \u05e0\u05e4\u05e7\u05d3) in Numbers 31,49 where the officers returning from the punitive campaign against Midian thanked G\u2019d for having returned without having lost a single soldier in that campaign. Our author comments that the word spelled without the letter \u05d5 as it appears in our text invalidates the numerical values quoted. [His attempt at resolving this does not sound convincing to this Editor ]"}}}}
