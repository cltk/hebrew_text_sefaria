Moses said, (Deuteronomy 1:12), \"How (eichah) will I carry alone...\". Isaiah said, (Isaiah 1:21) \"How (eichah) she has become a prostitute...\" Jeremiah said, (Lamentations 1:1) \"How (eichah) does she dwell...\" Said Rabbi Levi: It is compared to a noble woman who had three friends. One saw her in her tranquility, one saw her in her recklessness, and one saw her in her degenerateness. So did Moses see Israel in their honor, and in their tranquility, and he said, \"How will I carry their burden alone?\" Isaiah saw them in their recklessnes, and he said \"How she has become a prostitute...\" Jeremiah saw them in their degenerateness, and he said, \"How does she dwell...\" They asked Ben Azzai, and they said to him: Our teacher, homileticize something for us from from the Lamentation Scroll. He said to them: Israel was not exiled until they denied the unity of the world, and [denial of] circumcision that had been given [after] 20 generations, and of the 10 commandments, and of the 5 books of the Torah, the numbers in \"Eichah\" (Alef - Yud - Chaf - Heh = 1-10-20-5). Rabbi Levi said: Israel was not exiled until they denied the 36 [punishments] of spiritual extermination (karet) in the Torah, and the 10 commandments. From where? \"Eichah yashva badad\" (Eichah = 36, Badad = 10). Rabbi Berachia in the name of Rav Avdimi from Haifa: [This is compared] to a king who had a son. When [the son] does his father's will, he was dressed in clothes of fine wool. When he doesn't do the will of the [Omnipresent?], he is dressed in the clothes of the exiled (badad). So is Israel, whenever they do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is written (Ezekiel 16:10) \"I clothed you in embroidered dress...\" Rabbi Sima: A cloak. The translation of Aquila: Embroidered garments. Whenever they don't do the will of the Holy one, blesses be He, they are dressed in the clothes of the exiled, which is what is written, \"How she dwells alone (badad).' Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The Holy One, blessed be He, called to the ministering angels. He said to them: A king of flesh and blood, when one of his dies, and he becomes mournful, what is his way to do? They said to him: He hangs a sack on his entranceway. He said to them: So too Me, thus shall I do. Thus it is written: (Isaiah 50:3) \"I cloth the heavens in blackness, and I will place a sack as their covering.\" [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? They said to him: He extinguishes the lanterns. He said to them: Thus shall I do, as it is said, (Joel 2:10) \"The sun and the moon are darkened.\" [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? They said to him: He overturns the beds. He said to them: Thus shall I do, as it is written, (Daniel 7:9) \"till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit\". As if it's possible, they were upside down. [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? [They said:] He goes barefoot. [He said:] Thus shall I do, as it is written, (Nahum 1:3) \"The Lord's way is in the tempest and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.\" [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? [They said:] He rips his cloak. [God said:] Thus shall I do, as it is written, (Lamentations 2:17) \"God has done what He planned, bitza emrato.\" Rabbi Yaaakov of Kfar Channan interpreted it: What is \"bitza emrato\"? It is \"He ripped His cloak\". [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? [They said:] He sits in silence. [God said:] Thus shall I do, as it is written, as it is written, (Lamentations 3:28) \"He shall sit alone and in silence.\" [God asked:] A mourning king of flesh and blood, what is his way to do? [They said:] He sits and cries. [God said:] Thus shall I do.
