But in chapter Hakometz it says, \"if he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two blessings.\" Rashi explained that it says so on both Tefillin, that he says one blessing on both of them if he did not talk in between them, but it is difficult to say that the two blessings of \"to lay\" and \"concerning the precept\" were only needed when he talked and did a transgression. Therefore Rabbeinu Tam explained that on that of the head, which is the finishing of the commandment and the main part, because it has four compartments and the letter Shin, he says on it (an additional blessing of) \"on the precept,\" and this is (how it appears) in Shimusha Rabba, authored by the Ge'onim. And according to the explanation of Rabbeinu Tam regarding \"if he talked he says two blessings,\" (it refers to) if he puts on that of the head alone, since they (the two Tefillin) do not hold back each other  (from letting the wearer fulfill a commandment from it), he says two blessings. And this that the Gemara doesn't mention that on that of the head he says two blessings, it is because it is not at all common to place one without placing the other, since Tefillin by one with an obligation is common. And Rabbeinu Tam explained like this in his Responsa, and Rabbeinu Elchanan, in his \"Order of the enactment of prayer,\" wrote like this."}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "12": {}, "13": {}, "14": {"0": {}, "1": {}, "10": {}, "11": {}, "12": {}, "13": {}, "14": {}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {}, "2": {}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {}, "23": {}, "24": {}, "25": {}, "26": {}, "27": {}, "28": {}, "29": {}, "3": {}, "30": {}, "31": {}, "32": {}, "33": {}, "34": {}, "35": {}, "36": {}, "37": {}, "38": {}, "39": {}, "4": {}, "40": {}, "41": {}, "42": {}, "43": {}, "44": {}, "45": {}, "46": {}, "47": {}, "48": {}, "49": {}, "5": {}, "50": {}, "51": {}, "52": {}, "53": {}, "54": {}, "55": {}, "56": {}, "57": {}, "58": {}, "59": {}, "6": {}, "60": {}, "61": {}, "62": {}, "63": {}, "64": {}, "65": {}, "66": {}, "67": {}, "68": {}, "69": {}, "7": {}, "70": {}, "71": {}, "72": {}, "73": {}, "74": {}, "75": {}, "76": {}, "77": {}, "78": {}, "79": {}, "8": {}, "80": {}, "81": {}, "82": {}, "83": {}, "84": {}, "85": {}, "86": {}, "87": {}, "88": {}, "89": {}, "9": {}, "90": {}, "91": {}, "92": {"0": "Verses twice and translation (Targum, i.e. Aramaic translation) once - Some explain that the requirement [of reading a translation] applies to foreigners in their (native) language, as it is like (Aramaic) Targum that sometimes explains the verses.

Therefore, it appears to say, one does not bless and one is not permitted to bless, and the Yerushalmi explains why, and says because of Kavod HaMeit (respect for the dead). Alternatively, because he doesn't have anyone who will carry his burden. We ask a question: but isn't it taught in a Braita: exempt from netilat lulav. And should you think we are dealing with Yom Tov, and there he is not too busy to carry the burden, and we teach that it is referring to Chol, meaning Chol HaMoed [because he could potentially bury on Chol]. But isn't it taught in a Braita: 'Exempt from the blowing of the shofar'. It should have said on a weekday and not on Yom Tov. And that's a question. And we answer: Rav Chanina said, since he needs to prepare the casket and the shrouds [which the dead wear], as it is taught in a Mishnah: \"you may violate the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds\" its as if he is carrying the burden. Consequently, the implication is that on shabbat and yom tov you are not permitted to make blessings and pray since you are busy violating the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds. But there is a question from the end where it says \"on shabbat you make blessings and a mezuman.
