He did so as He did not consider it fitting for Moses who had erected the Tabernacle to have to stand outside while His glory was inside. Moses had been afraid to enter as He had not been invited to do so, as long as the cloud was resting above the Tabernacle. Rashi adds that an additional reason for G\u2019d calling to Moses first before speaking to him, was that this was also so when He completed speaking to him. The absence of any word indicating this, is that G\u2019d, when having completed what He had to say, did not do so by anything indicating this. Furthermore the word \u05dc\u05d5, \u201cto him,\u201d which is really not necessary, was to teach that while Moses heard the call while standing outside, the people did not. In Numbers 7,89, at the end of the consecration of the Tabernacle, the Torah elaborates by writing that Moses heard the sound of G\u2019d\u2019s voice emanating from between the cherubs on the Holy Ark. The word \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cto him,\u201d there makes it clear that only he heard that voice.\n", "1": "\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05d4\u05de\u05d4, \u201cfrom some species of domesticated mammals;\u201d Torat Kohanim sees in the wording proof that G\u2019d did not want to tire out the Israelites excessively by having to hunt free roaming \u201ckosher\u201d animals to be served up as sacrifices, and this is why only domesticated animals, \u05d1\u05d4\u05de\u05d4, were declared suitable for that purpose.", "2": "\u05d0\u05dc \u05e4\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5, \u201che shall bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle.\u201d This line is necessary so that we understand that it is not good enough for someone wishing to offer an animal sacrifice to say to the priest: \u201chere is the animal, take it and offer it on my behalf.\u201d If he did so, it would not be considered good manners vis a vis Heaven.

Seeing that He is not in need of food or drink, this legislation is clearly meant for the benefit of the Jewish people. When a person has sinned, and offered a sacrifice to further his atonement, knowing that after that he will be free of sin, he will be careful not to commit a careless act which resulted in his becoming obligated to cleanse himself from sin. If, on the other hand, he fails to take steps to obtain atonement, he will undoubtedly continue to commit sins as our sages have said in the Talmud tractate Kidushin, folio 20: \u201conce a person has committed a sin-and has not repented and taken steps to rehabilitate himself,-the sin will no longer appear to him as having been a trespass against G\u2019d, but he will treat it as if it had not even been a sin.\u201d They explain this by comparing it to someone who has found a stain on his outer garment. Unless he takes steps to remove it, it will soon become something that he gets used to and before long his whole garment will become soiled. Concerning this subject, Solomon, in Kohelet, 9,8 says: \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05e2\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9\u05da \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cbe sure that your garments are white at all times;\u201d our sages in the Talmud, tractate Makkot folio 2,add: \u201cdo not let them become stained by sin.\u201d The Torah added numerous commandments, which the average person would perform even if the Torah had not specifically commanded him to do so. The reason is that it wished to give us additional opportunities to acquire spiritual merits."}, "2": {"0": "\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d2\u05d2\u05d4, \u201cif someone commits a sin inadvertently;\u201d it is noteworthy that the verse does not commence with the word: \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd, \u201ca human being,\u201d as it does in Genesis chapter one verse two, where it describes someone feeling the urge to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. When the prophet Ezekiel in Ezekiel 18,4, writes about the same subject, he too commences by referring to the subject as \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, i.e. the animalistic part of our soul. The point that is being made in both these verses is that a sin can only be the product of the animalistic life force in our body, not the spiritual part that G\u2019d blew into Adam\u2019s nostrils when the result was his becoming a human being, \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd. (Compare Genesis 2,7 where he is then described as \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d4, \u201ca living creature,\u201d not just as \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9.) The creature described as \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, is by definition mortal, as is clear from the verse quoted from Ezekiel 18,4, where the prophet concludes with the word: \u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cit is bound to die.\u201d Consider the following parable: two subjects had each committed a trespass against their king. One is an ordinary citizen, whereas the second one was one of the people engaged by the palace where he made his living. They were both arraigned for judgment. The King decreed that the ordinary citizen was to be released forthwith, whereas he imposed a painful penalty for the member of the palace staff who had committed a similar offence. The other members of the palace staff were very disturbed when they observed that their colleague had been singled out for harsher punishment. They questioned the king about this. The King told them that the first citizen, being a stranger, was not familiar with the good qualities of the king. He could therefore be forgiven for having committed this trespass. The palace employees, however, who were well aware of all the king had done for them, could not be forgiven for having trespassed against his rules instead of being especially careful not to commit such an offence. The same applies to creatures who possess only a body, i.e. who though human, did not have a Divine soul, which made them part of the heavenly regions, i.e. they are part of the staff of G\u2019d\u2019s Palace. They are charged with ensuring that their \u201cuniform,\u201d the soul, is in a state of purity at all times. As a result of this difference, the bodies who did not receive a \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d4, a soul from heaven, when they die are buried and this is all. Human beings endowed with a heavenly soul, however, come up for judgment to determine if the G\u2019d given soul is being returned in the condition it had been given to them.", "1": "\u05d0\u05ea \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e4\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9, \u201cin front of the veil of the Sanctuary.\u201d In verse 17, where we have a similar procedure, the adjective \u201choly\u201d after the word: \u05e4\u05e8\u05db\u05ea is missing. Why is this? Is it not the same curtain? It is to teach us that if only the High Priest has committed a sin, the presence of G\u2019d does not depart, but if an entire congregation commits a sin, that presence goes into \u201chiding,\u201d i.e. people forfeit the privilege of G\u2019d \u201ddwelling\u201d on earth within the Tabernacle.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7\u05d4, \u201cand make it smoke on the altar.\u201d The expression \u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d7, \u201cof pleasing odour,\u201d is missing here as when an individual of high rank sins, G\u2019d is more harsh than He is with average people.", "3": "\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cor it has become known to him;\u201d the Torah uses the singular mode here as well as in verse 28 where the individual who has become guilty of a sin is the leader of his tribe. Some commentators, including Rashi, understand both these verses as applying to people who at the time when they committed the trespass were convinced that what they did was perfectly permissible. Others understand the word \u05d0\u05d5 here to mean the same as \u05d0\u05dd, \u201cif.\u201d However, the author of the commentary b\u2019chor shor of blessed memory, writes that seeing that both ordinary individuals as well as the leader of a tribe have to bring an asham taluy, sin offering of a suspended nature, [arresting potential punishment, until the doubt has been resolved, Ed] when in doubt if they had committed a certain sin. Our verse deals with that doubt having been resolved so that a sin offering to atone for a definitely committed sin is now required. The same situation also applies to verse 27 in this chapter, where the verse following deals with the situation after it has become clear. The author of \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 quotes as proof for his interpretation Torat Kohanim on the words: \u05de\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4' \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, \u201cfrom amongst one of G\u2019d\u2019s commandments that must not be violated.\u201d (verse 27) The author of that volume understands the word \u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05dd at the end of that verse as indicating that this asham taluy is not appropriate in that situation. When a community has become guilty of such a sin and a doubt arises, no asham taluy is required. This is based on the fact that when the Torah discussed the situation requiring it, it had spoken of \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0, \u201cif an individual had committed a sin.\u201d When the High Priest had committed a sin, this is linked to a trespass by \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd, \u201cthe people,\u201d and this is the reason why the situation described as \u201cor he had become aware of it,\u201d is not mentioned there, as if the High Priest had been in doubt and everything he does, he does as the representative of the people, such an asham taluy was not appropriate.\n", "4": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7\u05d4, \u201cand make it smoke on the altar.\u201d The expression \u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d7, \u201cof pleasing odour,\u201d is missing here as when an individual of high rank sins, G\u2019d is more harsh than He is with average people.\n"}, "3": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4, \u201cby having heard an oath demanding him to testify, and having ignored it;\u201d all the other paragraphs distinguish between inadvertently committed sins and those committed deliberately except the one involving an oath, known as \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05ea \u05d1\u05d8\u05d5\u05d9, \u201ca futile oath,\u201d which is automatically considered as the one who uttered it doing so while aware of its implications.

Ed.] The reason the Torah uses the unusual formulation \u201cwhich he had not commanded them,\u201d instead of \u201dwhich He had forbidden them,\u201d is that on occasion, in exceptional circumstances, G\u2019d does permit something which is ordinarily prohibited. The Torah underlines that this was not such an occasion. An example of such an exception would be what Elijah did on Mount Carmel in his confrontation with the 400 hundred priests of the Baal. (Kings I 18). He used a private altar something which was strictly forbidden since the Temple had been erected. We also find a verse in Jeremiah 7,31, where the prophet uses this expression as having been used by G\u2019d. In that example the prophet chides the people for sacrificing their children to G\u2019d saying that this had never occurred for G\u2019d to have them do.

Even though it is in order to use man made fire, as we have read specifically in Leviticus 1,7: \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05d0\u05e9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7, \u201cthe sons of Aaron are to put fire on the altar, this was in addition to the heavenly fire which had come down a single time. Before G\u2019d had demonstrated acceptance of the Israelites\u2019 offerings in the Temple precincts, they were not allowed to use man made fire, as it would have belittled the miracle G\u2019d provided. People would have argued that their offerings had been consumed by man made fire. This is why G\u2019d struck these two sons of Aaron with fire emanating in heaven. Our author has difficulty with this interpretation, as the Torah had written in Leviticus 9,24: \u05d5\u05ea\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e9 \u05de\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d5\u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7, \u201cfire came forth from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and its fat parts.\u201d How could the sons of Aaron therefore have belittled G\u2019d\u2019s fire by what they did? This is why the sages in the Talmud tractate Yuma folio 53, state that the sons of Aaron did not die because of this, but because they had dared to usurp the authority of Moses and Aaron by making halachic decisions without first having consulted with these leaders.", "1": "'\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4, \u201cas a result they died before the Lord.\u201d We find a dispute recorded in the Torat Kohanim concerning the meaning of this phrase. According to Rabbi Eliezer, they died outside the Tabernacle in an area that the Levites were permitted to enter; he bases himself on the wording in verse five, in which the Torah describes how their bodies were removed from the spot where they died. The Torah describes the sons of Elitzafan, an uncle of Aaron as performing this task, with the words: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05db\u05ea\u05e0\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05e5 \u05dc\u05de\u05d7\u05e0\u05d4, \u201dthey approached and lifted them up by their tunics and carried them out of the camp as they had been instructed to do by Moses.\u201d If that is so, why did the Torah write that they died \u201cbefore the Lord,\u201d i.e. on sacred ground, not accessible to the Levites? This is why Rabbi Akiva disagreed and said that they had actually died inside sacred ground, and that the sons of Elitzafan had to use a long iron spear in order to pull placing that spear in their mouths and dragging their bodies to less sacred ground before they could lift them up, as they were only Levites and not priests. This presents us with a different problem, as in that event the Tabernacle itself would have become ritually impure as it formed a tent over the bodies of Nadav and Avihu, and it would have required purification rites which would last seven days. The Torah does not, however, report that the service in the Tabernacle had been interrupted for that length of time. Our author concludes that the subject needs further study.

This statement is most puzzling, as this is nothing new, and we know from Leviticus 21,1 that priests must not defile themselves. Seeing that both Elazar and Ittamar were not High Priests, why would they be forbidden to bury their brothers seeing that they belonged to the seven closest relatives on whose account they are permitted to defile themselves in such a situation? We must therefore assume that what the author of Torat Kohanim had in mind was that on days when ordinary priests have been appointed to perform service in the Temple, they are considered on the same level of sanctity as a High Priest, and on such days they must not defile themselves even in order to bury one of the seven closest relatives. This is also the opinion of the author of b\u2019chor shor, in his commentary on verse 6, i.e. \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5, \u201clet not your hair on your head grow loose.\u201d The reason why this rule was revealed on that day was that on that day the brothers of Nadav and Avihu had been appointed to perform duties in the Tabernacle, so that they had become subject to the restrictions applying to their father the High Priest. On ordinary days, ordinary priests do not have to observe the restriction of not letting their hair grow loose. [At the time in question there had been only five priests, Aaron and his four sons. Ed.] Our author feels that the words: \u05db\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd, \u201cfor the holy anointing oil is upon you,\u201d in the verse following, reinforces the commentary by the author of b\u2019chor shor.", "4": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05e2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e7\u05e6\u05d5\u05e3, \u201cso that He will not become angry at the whole congregation;\u201d the Lord will be angry if you display rites of mourning, as it would then appear as if your offerings which you had presented to the Lord had not been received by Him with goodwill. In the event that you would respond that if we did not mourn our brothers, the impression would be created that they had forfeited their status of being priests by what they had done, seeing that no one had mourned them, Moses commanded all the ordinary Israelites to weep and mourn for the two sons of Aaron who had been burned to death by G\u2019d.", "5": "\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05e9\u05db\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e9\u05ea, \u201cdo not drink wine or other intoxicating drinks;\u201d this commandment applies when on that day the priest is called upon to perform service in the Temple. Seeing that the High Priest is called upon to do so daily or at least to be ready to do so daily, it is addressed here to him in the singular mode. It is a cautionary commandment, to protect him against becoming inebriated. We know that normally there are many occasions when the consumption of wine is not prohibited, but is part and parcel of our rituals, and the priests are included in this also. We know already from Noah\u2019s experience how overindulgence in alcoholic drink can cause man to lose his dignity not only temporarily but permanently. Solomon, in Proverbs 23,29-31 dwells on the manifold evils that can beset anyone who drinks to excess, so much so that the red colour of wine is used by him as a symbol of blood, i.e. bloodshed, that can be the result of drunkenness. Solomon continues with: \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05ea\u05df \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e1 \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05da \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201conly he who will look at the cup will walk upright.\u201d This sounds somewhat peculiar at first glance until we notice that the word \u05db\u05d5\u05e1 for \u201ccup\u201d is misspelled as if it were referring to \u05db\u05d9\u05e1, \u201dpocket.\u201d What Solomon means is that drinking too much may result in the drunk becoming a thief, desirous of obtaining by illegal means what is in someone else\u2019s pocket. This is why he continues with: \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05db\u05e0\u05d7\u05e9 \u05e0\u05d7\u05e9 \u05d5\u05db\u05e6\u05e4\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e4\u05e8\u05e9, \u201cin the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper.\u201d He who aims at illegal gain will wind up walking upright, as he will have lost what was rightfully his and therefore can walk upright having nothing to carry that would force him to stoop under its weight. Some commentators understand the comparison Solomon makes with the snake as referring to the original serpent, and they explain Adam\u2019s having drunk too much wine when celebrating his nuptials as the cause of his eating from the tree of knowledge as the result of his having been drunk. They suggest that the word \u05db\u05e0\u05d7\u05e9 be read as \u05d1\u05e0\u05d7\u05e9, that Adam transgressed the Lord\u2019s commandment as he too had been seduced by the snake by means of drinking too much wine. Eventually he had become cursed through the serpent. (Proverbs 23,32.) This is what the Torah meant when it wrote in Genesis 3,15: \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, \u201cand you shall bruise its heel.\u201d Seeing that wine had become the means through which man had been led into sin, when we use wine at joyous occasions, we do so after taking permission to do so from the people present by saying: \u05e1\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9, to which those present respond with the word \u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cmay this occasion of drinking wine be an auspicious one, leading to constructive life.\u201d There is an interesting story in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat, folio 66 about Rabbi Akiva having made a festive meal for his son, at which he pronounced the words: \u05d7\u05de\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e4\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05df \u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05d5\u05e4 \u05ea\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4\u05d5\u05df, \u201cwine for the good life of the scholars and their disciples!\u201d When Solomon says in Proverbs 23,33: \u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05da \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cand your eyes will see strange things,\u201d he means that when under the influence of wine you will imagine that things which are forbidden are in reality permitted. This leads you to commit adultery, and to abuse the power of speech by speaking in a manner unworthy of a sane human being. Not only this, but ultimately it can lead you to commit idolatry. He bases himself on Exodus 32,6: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05d5\u05e9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7, \u201cthe people sat down to eat; they drank, and they got up in order to make merry.\u201d Our author quotes a similar verse from Psalms 81,10, the psalmist saying: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05da \u05d0\u05dc \u05d6\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e9\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05e0\u05db\u05e8, \u201cyou shall have no foreign god and you shall not bow down to an alien god.\u201d In both instances the reference is to the golden calf to which the Jewish people bowed and around which many of them danced. When Solomon in Proverbs speaks of \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05da \u05d9\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05db\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cyour heart will speak perversities,\u201d he refers to four such perversities; a) idolatry, 2) forbidden sexual unions, 3) shedding innocent blood, and 4) slander. In verse 20 of the same chapter in Proverbs where we read: \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e1\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05d6\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05de\u05d5, \u201cdo not belong to the category of people who guzzle wine, or to those who glut themselves with meat!,\u201d he hints at the ben sorrer umoreh, the wayward son whose end is execution based on the testimony of his own parents. (Deuteronomy 22,18-21) This lad\u2019s corruption had begun because he drank to excess. On the subject of drinking wine, we have another comment in the Talmud, tractate Eyruvin folio 65, by Rabbi Chiya son of Ashi, according to which anyone who can drink wine and whose faculties are not negatively affected by this, is on a mental/spiritual level equivalent to the seventy elders who helped Moses look after the Israelites in the desert. He bases himself on the numerical value of the word \u05d9\u05d9\u05df, wine, which is 70. The word \u05e1\u05d5\u05d3, secret, also has a numerical value of 70. Overindulgence in wine, loosens one\u2019s tongue and makes a person unable to keep a secret. One of the outstanding features of the seventy elders was their ability to remain discreet and not reveal what was supposed to be kept secret. Our sages coined the phrase therefore that \u201cwhen wine enters a person\u2019s body his secrets become revealed.\u201d [One \u2018seventy\u2019 is replaced by another \u2018seventy.\u2019 Ed.] Rabbi Chaninah, on the same folio, states that anyone who while under the influence of wine is more open to view his companions agreeably, proves that he possesses some characteristic displayed by his Creator. He bases himself on Genesis 8,21, \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d7, where the Lord is portrayed as becoming receptive to the fragrance of Noach\u2019s offering. [The Talmud had previously shown that \u05e8\u05d9\u05d7, customarily translated as smell, is also used as a term describing imbibing. In the quote cited, G\u2019d undertakes never to bring on a deluge again as a reaction to that fragrant odour. Ed. When examining why wine was created, seeing that it is potentially destructive in its effect, the Talmud states that Solomon has provided the answer in Proverbs 31,6, where he advises \u05ea\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05db\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05d1\u05d3 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, \u201cgive liquor to one who is about to perish and wine to someone who is embittered, (in mourning for a relative). [Our author continues about the subject of wine and its advantages and disadvantages. I have omitted the balance of this paragraph. Ed.] An alternate interpretation of the introductory words of our verse: the priest is advised not to indulge in intoxicating drink (even when not called for duty in the Temple, and even when in mourning;)\n", "6": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea \u05d3\u05e8\u05e9, \u201cand he (Moses) demanded an accounting about what had been done with the he-goat that was a sin offering;\u201d When commenting on Leviticus 9,11, Rashi points out that we never find that a sin-offering slaughtered on the copper altar was burned up except the one discussed in that verse, and the bullock serving as sin offering during the consecration rites for the High Priest. In both those instances there had to be a special commandment from Hashem to do so. [Normally parts of these sin offerings were consumed by the priests. Ed.] This is in contrast to sin offerings offered on the golden altar inside the Sanctuary, no parts of which were ever eaten. This raises the problem with Rashi\u2019s commentary on Numbers 8,8, where the bullock serving as sin offering when the Levites were appointed in lieu of the firstborns is discussed. [The text describes that offering as a sin offering, whereas Rashi calls it \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, burnt offering, i.e. none of it is to be eaten. This offering was slaughtered on the copper altar on the courtyard of the Tabernacle. The function of this animal is first not described at all, whereas the Torah then proceeds to describe a second bullock to be offered on that occasion as a sin-offering. The reader will understand Rashi\u2019s difficulty when he looks up the verse in question. Ed.] We must therefore assume that what Rashi had meant to say is that we do not find more than these two sin offerings which had been slaughtered on the copper altar as having been burned up including their skins outside sacred grounds. Our author finds additional problems involving the definitions of some offerings, none of which he was able to offer a solution to.\n"}, "8": {"0": "\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2, \u201cwhen a woman conceives, etc.\u201d what is meant here is that if the woman reaches orgasm in her marital relations with her husband before he does, she will give birth to a male child.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05d4 \u05ea\u05dc\u05d3, \u201cand if she gives birth to a female child, etc.\u201d the Torah now describes what procedure to follow if, as a result of the husband reaching orgasm first, a baby girl is born. We know this is the meaning from the letter \u05d5 before the word: \u05d0\u05dd, \u201cif or when.\u201d This is how the Talmud, tractate Niddah, folio 31 interprets our verse. Some scholars claim to have read in articles dealing with these matters scientifically, that every woman has seven orifices in her body, three on her right side and three on her left side and one in the middle. If the man\u2019s semen enters any of the orifices on her right side she will give birth to a male child, whereas if it enters on one of the orifices on her left side she will give birth to a female child. If it enters the orifice in her middle, the baby born will either possess no (visible) genitals or the genitals of both sexes. According to these theories it depends on the woman\u2019s position during marital intercourse. If she lies on her right side, she will give birth to a male child, i.e. her ritual impurity will depart from her relatively quickly. This is why the Torah provided for her to be ritually unclean for relations with her husband for only seven days after giving birth. If she had been lying on her left side, her ritual contamination departs more slowly, and that is why the Torah put her out of bounds for marital intercourse for a period of fourteen days. This is why Solomon said in Song of Songs 2,6: \u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5 \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05ea\u05d7\u05d1\u05e7\u05e0\u05d9, \u201chis left is under my head, and his right embraces me.\u201d The love-sick partner in this poem indicates her desire to bear male children.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cshe shall be cleansed from the source of her ritual impurity.\u201d What is the purpose of this verse? Even if the woman who had given birth had seen menstrual blood during all these days of ritual cleansing, she would be able to bring the requisite offerings at the conclusion of these 33 or 66 days after the initial period when she was out of bounds to her husband? Even if we were to assume that these words refer to the blood she saw while ritually unclean, there was no need to repeat the word \u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cher blood (her insides had not healed yet).\u201d Her ritual purity does not depend on her bleeding or not bleeding, as she is not able to offer the sacrifices concluding her state of being considered a \u05d9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea \u201cbirthing woman\u201d even if she had not only stopped bleeding immediately after giving birth, but had experienced what halachah describes as a \u201cdry\u201d birth! The reason why the expression \u05d5\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4, \u201cshe regained her ritual purity,\u201d is in place is because until the expiry of these days and her having brought the requisite offerings, she cannot partake of food which is the residue of animals that have been slaughtered on the altar in the courtyard of the Temple, as well as agricultural products to be given to a priest, i.e. t\u2019rumah.\u201d", "3": " \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df, \u201cand the priest shall make atonement for her.\u201d Some people understand this procedure as being in the nature of physical cleansing as in Leviticus 14,19: \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, \u201che will cleanse him on account of his uncleanness;\u201d or in verse 53 of the same chapter: \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea, \u201che will make atonement for the house.\u201d In both these verses the subjects are afflictions either on the skin or the house, [neither of which can be considered as \u201cguilty,\u201d so that atonement in the spiritual sense would be required for them. Ed.] We find a similar expression in connection with someone suffering an uncontrollable emission of semen from his sexual organ, i.e. a disease. Clearly, it was not the semen that is at fault and requires purification on that account. (Compare Leviticus 15,15) While it is true that the afflictions in these verses were the result of the person suffering them having committed a sin, it still would sound incomprehensible if their belongings would be \u201cpunished.\u201d Furthermore, the expression \u05d5\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea, \u201che will cleanse the house,\u201d is used in the spiritual sense [seeing the root of the word is \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 sin, so that \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 and \u05d5\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0, can be used both for describing spiritual cleansing and physical cleansing, depending on the context in which these words appear.

If one looks at the same section of skin every day, it is difficult to notice any changes. But if one has not seen it for a period of time, any changes can be noticed immediately. It is assumed that these changes, if any, occur very gradually. When Noach was in the ark and he wished to check if the water level around him had dropped, he also allowed seven days to elapse between dispatching a raven or a dove to examine this state of affairs. (Genesis 8,10). Actually, this comparison is not valid, as in our situation the priest had already marked the outer limits on the skin of the symptoms of the afflicted person clearly. He took the additional precaution of locking that person up in order to prevent him from tampering with what he had marked. He suspected such a person of trying to mislead him at the next inspection of the nega, skin-eczema.", "1": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e7, \u201cand if deeper;\u201d we find that the Torat Kohanim explains that the reason why the Torah wrote the unusually long \u201cand the nega had not assumed a deeper appearance than the skin in the interval between the inspection then the afflicted person is pronounced ritually contaminated,\u201d is that if it had not done so, we would have thought that only a spreading of the symptoms would lead the priest to declare the afflicted person as ritually contaminated. The fact that the area afflicted had not diminished, is proof that the symptoms had been that which the afflicted person himself had suspected to begin with. The Torah uses similar language when discussing symptoms of boils in verse 20 of our chapter. The wording of the entire chapter has to be understood in this vein. However, according to the explanation of Rashi, the word \u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e7 has to be understood as relative, i.e. like shade compared to an area lit up by the sun. This does not sound like a good comparison for the word \u05d4\u05e1\u05d2\u05e8, \u201clocking up.\u201d Our author admits that when speaking of north Europeans who have a very light skin the comparison is more apt. With people like that the appearance of the nega described in the Torah is not usually so much different from his normal skin colour. This sounds far fetched as we are told that the skin eczema known as baheret, is as white as snow, and what can be whiter than snow?\n"}, "1": "\u05e2\u05de\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cand the plague had retained the same appearance, looking the same in the eyes of the priest,\u201d (who had examined it the last time). According to Rashi who considers the subject as being the nega, affliction, the Torah should have written \u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5, in the present tense.", "2": "\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea, \u201cagain on the seventh day;\u201d we learn from here that the nega will not become ritually clean unless it had shrunk. This is also how Rashi explains it with the word \u05db\u05d4\u05d4, i.e. its appearance had become dimmer. If it had become more pronounced or remained static the afflicted person is ritually unclean. The accepted ruling, halachah, however, is that if it did not spread out, the afflicted person is declared ritually clean. This has also been spelled out in the Mishnah in tractate Nega\u2019im chapter 1, Mishnah 3. We quote: \u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05e6\u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05df \u05d6\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05e1\u05d2\u05d9\u05e8., \u201cAny of these four shades (that have been mentioned before) may combine together to declare clean, or to certify as definite affliction by a nega, or to cause the suspected victim to be shut up.\u201d The first example listed is that the suspected area has remained static at the end of the second week. The expression in the Mishnah \u05dc\u05d4\u05e1\u05d2\u05e8, for shutting up, refers to the first examination after the priest\u2019s visit. The expression \u05dc\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8, to declare ritually clean, refers to the visit of the priest after the second week. Similar rules apply if the symptoms had been white like snow after the first week, and by the end of the second week the affected area looked like the whitewashed area of Sanctuary. This is not considered as \u201chaving dimmed,\u201d but as having remained static, until the area afflicted has shrunk. Some scholars state that the reason these details have been written in the Torah in this context is to tell us that if the appearance had not dimmed at all, then the afflicted person is declared ritually clean. We are to learn that a change from snow white to whitewashed, or vice versa from snow-white to whitewashed or vice versa, is not to be interpreted as a new type of nega having surfaced. Our author quotes one or two alternate interpretations of the words \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea, but seeing that the legislation does not apply in our time and we need the prophet Elijah to rule on whose interpretation is correct, this editor sees no point in pursuing this subject at this time.\n", "3": "\u05d5\u05e0\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea, \u201cand he is to be seen by the priest a second time.\u201d The Torah should have written: \u201ca third time,\u201d as the priest had already seen that person twice.\n", "4": "\u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0, \u201cit is the dreaded skin disease known as tzoraat.\u201d What had first been diagnosed as \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 and had therefore been described in the masculine mode, is now described in the feminine mode, i.e. \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea.

Similarly what is described by the Torah as michyeh, i.e. \u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4, in verse 24, is a sure sign of ritual impurity, regardless of any changes from one week to another.

Rashi writes that although this verse has been understood by the Talmud in tractate Kidushin folio 25, differently. i.e. 24 limbs of the human body are not subject to this kind of ritual contamination as they require the visual inspection of a priest, the Torah here specifically spells out that if symptoms of eczema break out before the afflicted person has shaved himself, this rule does not apply to the symptoms described here, as \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4. [Compare Maimonides hilchot tumat tzoraat chapter three halachah eight Ed.] Our author repeats that Rashi here was not accurate and disagrees with the version of Torat Kohanim.

However, we find that in the Torat Kohanim this word plus the fact that instead of the afflicted person being the subject in this verse, the subject is the state of his skin, teaches that in spite of the nega not being able to develop in the normal manner, the person so afflicted is already declared as ritually impure. The boil, \u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05df, must first heal completely, before a healing process for the nega can even begin.", "8": "\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05de\u05ea, \u201cor a white rising or a bright spot, reddish white;\u201d according to Torat Kohanim, the reddish looking spot is a phenomenon that occurs with all the four different types of the skin diseases described in this chapter.

(Compare details in the Talmud tractate Sanhedrin folio 106. [That chapter deals with people who have or will forfeit their claim to an afterlife. Ed.]Solomon in Kohelet,5,5, also deals with this subject when he wrote: \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05ea\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05e4\u05d9\u05da \u05dc\u05d7\u05d8\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8\u05da, \u201clet not your mouth bring guilt on your flesh;\u201d which sin did he had in mind? The sin of badmouthing fellow Jews. Solomon referred to the same sin in Proverbs 18,21, when he said: \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u201cdeath and life are within the power of the tongue.\u201d Death is liable to follow abuse of the power of speech, whereas life is at the disposal of people who meticulously observe the Torah and study it. The Torah is the remedy with which the sin of evil gossip can be atoned for. It is known as the \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthe tree of life.\u201d We know this also from Solomon, who said in Proverbs 15,4: \u05de\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthe tree of life can heal (the harm caused) by abusing one\u2019s power of speech.\u201d Intensive Torah study prevents a person from becoming guilty of using his power of speech. The guilt of \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e8\u05e2, evil gossip, is considered as greater that that of being guilty of shedding innocent blood. When one is guilty of the latter, one had only killed one life, whereas when one is guilty of evil gossip, one is guilty of killing at least three people, the one who engages in it, the one who listens to it, and the one about whom this evil gossip has been spread. We find an illustration of this in Samuel I 22, where King Sha-ul killed all the priests resident in the city of Nov because he had listened to the false accusations spread against them by Doag. Sha-ul was killed on account of that sin as we know from Samuel Il 1,9: \u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05e0\u05d0 \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05e5, \u201cstand over me and finish me off, for | am in agony and barely alive;\u201d whenever we encounter the expression \u05e9\u05d1\u05e5, it refers to the priestly garments, as we know from Exodus 28,39: \u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea \u05e9\u05e9, \u201cmake the fringed tunic out of fine linen.\u201d Concerning Doag, the slanderer, in this story we have it on the authority of Psalms 52,7 that he was killed in this world and deprived of the after life, i.e. \u05d2\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05ea\u05e6\u05da \u05dc\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 \u05d9\u05d7\u05ea\u05da \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5', \u201calso G\u2019d will tear you down for good, and root you out, etc.\u201d The Talmud in tractate Erchin, folio 15, states that the sin of tale-bearing is greater than murder, incest or idolatry.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df, \u201cand he will be brought to the priest.\u201d We read this as if it had been written in the past tense, i.e. \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df, \u201che had come.\u201d The reason is that there was no one who could have brought him, as everyone had been warned not to associate with him in any manner.

I do this in order to give you a warning that worse is to come if you do not heed My warning. Before I sent Sancheriv to exile the ten tribes, I first let him conquer all the countries surrounding yours, so that you would take notice and mend your ways.

[The prophet spells all this out in subsequent verses. Ed.] In verse 55 of our chapter, the afflicted house and subsequently the afflicted garments of a person, are cited as warnings of physical afflictions to follow if the warnings were ignored. If the warnings were heeded by the owner of those houses or garments mending their ways their flesh will not become affected. We know this from what is written in chapter 15 verse 2: \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5 \u05d6\u05d1 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5', \u201cwhen any man has a discharge emanating from his sexual organ he is ritually contaminated.\u201d This is also what Solomon had in mind when he wrote in Proverbs 19,29:\u05e0\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05dc\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d5\u05de\u05d4\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d2\u05d5 \u05db\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, \u201dpunishments are prepared for the scoffers, beatings for the backs of the fools.\u201d G\u2019d is quoted by Solomon as having said that He prepared these methods of disciplining Man already before He even created Man himself."}, "11": {"0": "\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d3\u05de\u05d4,\u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1, \u201cand if a woman  have an issue of her blood, etc.\u201d what is described here is what Solomon in Kohelet 10,18 alluded to when he said: \u05d1\u05e2\u05e6\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05de\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d4, \u201cthrough slothfulness the ceiling sags, and through idleness of the hands, the house leaks.\u201d The symbolism contained in this verse refers to the neglect by a woman in observing the laws of ritual purity, especially those laws involving menstruation. If the woman fails to examine herself before the onset of her menses this can have dire consequences, both for herself and the husband with whom she entertains marital relations. In the Talmud tractate Shabbat second chapter, death in childbirth by a woman is mentioned as one of these consequences. If she handled certain hallowed foods while in a state of ritual impurity, she made these foods unfit for consumption and conferred ritual impurity on the party handling them without even having eaten them. An interesting story on this subject is related in the Talmud, tractate, Niddah, folio 6. The famous Rabbi Gamliel had a servant woman working for him, who would regularly be required to seal caskets of wine [of a highly consecrated level, Ed.] and move them to another. After each single time she had moved them, she examined herself about whether her menses had begun, as otherwise the whole casket and its contents would have been unfit for further use. This servant maid found that after she had moved the last casket she had started her period. Upon telling this to her master, she was told that if she had not been in the habit of checking herself after each time she moved a casket, not only the last one but all of them would have become ritually contaminated. This is also why on folio 13 of the same tractate, we have a statement to the effect that anyone who makes a point of frequently checking herself out in this respect is especially praiseworthy.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05ea\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, \u201cand after that she is ritually clean.\u201d Immersion of her whole body in forty measures of water in the ritual basin are what made her clean. Our sages in the Talmud tractate Eyruvin, folio 75 derive this from the words: \u05d0\u05da \u05d1\u05de\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d9\u05ea\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0, \u201cbut in the waters in which a menstruating woman bathes it will be cleansed.\u201d [after waiting for the appropriate number of days without bleeding, Ed.] (Numbers 31,23). In verses 16-17 in our chapter, these steps to obtain ritual cleanliness are spelled out. Midrash Rabbah on Isaiah 8,6, describing the slow moving river Shiloah as moving \u05dc\u05d0\u05d8, points out that the numerical value of that word is 40; hence 40 saah of rainwater or well water is the minimum required for a ritual bath this has become the minimum amount stipulated by our sages as adequate for submersion.\n"}, "12": {"0": "\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cafter the death;\u201d when we read in Kohelet 9,2: \u05db\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05db\u05d7\u05d5\u05d8\u05d0, \u201cas is the good man so is the sinner,\u201d this is a reference to the two sons of Aaron who died only on account of having arrogated to themselves the right to preempt their elders Moses and Aaron in issuing a religious ruling. This is the meaning of the Talmud, tractate Yuma, folio 53, where Rabbi Eliezer explained the word \u05d7\u05d5\u05d8\u05d0 as referring to their having done so. What precisely was the \u201cnew\u201d ruling that they revealed? They interpreted the line: \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d0\u05e9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7, \u201dthe sons of Aaron the priest placed fire (man made) on the altar;\u201d (in addition to the fire that came down from the heaven). (Leviticus 1,7) Their sin was basically the same as that of Korach and his congregation, and that is why both were burned to death by heavenly fire. (Compare Tanchuma on our portion, section 1) Rabbi Acha son of Ze-ira adds (in the Tanchuma) that this is also the meaning of Job 37,1: \u05d0\u05e3 \u05dc\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05e8 \u05de\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d5, \u201calso on account of this my heart quakes and leaps from its place;\u201d he compares what happened to the staff of Aaron when it was placed inside the Sanctuary which sprouted almonds, whereas his sons when they entered the Sanctuary were burned to death. (Numbers 17,23) He also contrasts the fact that the Roman general Titus dared to enter the Holy of Holies, and he left it unharmed although surely he was less qualified to have entered such sacred grounds. He had entered in order to blaspheme, whereas the sons of Aaron had entered in order to offer incense to the Lord. (Tanchuma section 4 on our portion) [No wonder at the reaction of Job when he reflected on this phenomenon. Ed.] This phenomenon is also the subject of Psalms 78,63: \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d0\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5, \u201cFire consumed their young men and their maidens remained unwed.\u201d The psalmist explains the reason that the sons of Aaron had to die as being that they had failed to get married. They had described themselves as so superior that no one was good enough to become their wives. They overestimated the value of having been born into such prominent families as their father and uncle. The result of their haughtiness was that they died without leaving behind any children.

[At the beginning of his commentary, he had already hinted that there is a mystical element, kabbalah, in all this. Ed.] What he meant was that when we count the next thirty three verses in the Torah and we get to Leviticus 17,7, the Torah will explain that the procedure described here is meant to teach us not to sacrifice to Satanic forces in the universe anymore. These Satanic forces are symbolised by the scapegoat. Just as the bird released into the air by the priest performing the ritual of the person afflicted with tzoraat is perceived as taking away his former sins, so the scapegoat is supposed to do this on behalf of the whole Jewish nation on the day of Atonement. Ibn Ezra understands the word \u05e2\u05d6\u05d0\u05d6\u05dc as a combination of two words, similar to \u05d2\u05dc\u05e2\u05d3 in Genesis 31,47 or to \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df in Genesis 35,18 or \u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d1\u05df in Genesis 29,32, and many others.

Seeing that the priest may not defile himself on account of a woman only betrothed to him, it is clear that he may defile himself on account of a sister who is betrothed but not married yet. Concerning the words \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, Rashi explains that they include a sister who is betrothed. This makes sense, as seeing that an ordinary priest may not defile himself in order to bury a woman betrothed to him, it is logical that he should be allowed to defile himself for a sister who is only betrothed. If his sister\u2019s husband to be had been a priest, he would not have been permitted to busy herself with her funeral. The Talmud in tractate Yevamot folio 22, understands the word \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5 as referring to the priest\u2019s properly married wife. This is also in agreement of what is written in verse 4: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d5, \u201ca husband shall not defile himself for his wife\u2019s corpse if she had not been legally permitted to be the wife of a priest.\u201d Unless the clause \u05dc\u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d5, \u201cto disgrace him,\u201d applied to his \u201cwife,\u201d he would, of course, be permitted to defile himself on her corpse. Furthermore, the fact that the Torah makes a distinction between a sister who has remained a virgin, (verse three) and it describes such a sister as \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cwho is close to him seeing that she had not been married,\u201d by adding: \u201che may defile himself on her account,\u201d it is clear that if she had been married already, her brother the priest, would not be permitted to defile himself at her funeral. The reason is simply that in that event her husband is considered as closer to her than her brother, though the former is a blood relative. The degree of relationship through marriage has been spelled out in the Torah already in Genesis 2,24, where the Torah described the bond of marriage as making \u201cone flesh\u201d out of husband and wife. There is no greater degree of \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4, physical intimacy, than that.", "1": "\u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cbut for his mother and his father\u2019s [funeral] etc;\u201d just as he may only defile himself for burying mother and father who had been fully alive, so this exception for other members of his closest family applies only to those who had been alive for at least thirty days. He must not defile himself on account of stillborn children, for instance. Seeing that the Torah saw fit to mention the mother before the father when discussing the rules for ordinary priests, why, when discussing the parents of the High Priest in verse eleven, does the Torah mention the father ahead of the mother? If it is forbidden for the ordinary priest to defile himself ritually at his mother\u2019s funeral, there is no need to repeat this as there is no doubt who was one\u2019s mother, whereas there is no certainty as to who was one\u2019s father. The father is added therefore to tell us that notwithstanding this uncertainty, he may defile himself at his father\u2019s funeral. In the case of the High Priest, the Torah mentions his mother last in order to tell us that in spite of our being certain the woman being buried was his mother, he is still not permitted to defile himself on her account.<br> \u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5, \u201cconcerning his brother or his sister, etc.;\u201d we find that according to Torat Kohanim that we might have thought that the Torah speaks of a brother and sister of the same mother; in order to show us that this is not so, the Torah adds the words: ,\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5, \u201cand concerning his son and his daughter.\u201d Just as the son and daughter are his potential heirs, so the brothers and sisters that are meant here are only those that are potentially heirs, i.e. they have the same father.

This ruling is based on the Talmud, tractate Yevamot folio 89: \u201dIf the High Priest calls out in order to attract the attention of other human beings, and no one answers his call, this is the situation known as \u05de\u05ea \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4, \u201ca corpse that anyone is called upon to bring to burial forthwith.\u201d This is a decree of great severity, i.e. if there is anyone else available the High Priest must not defile himself in order to perform this last act of kindness for the dead.\n", "3": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d5, \u201ca husband [a priest, of course, Ed.] among his people, shall not contaminate himself to one (his wife) who had become his wife as a result of her having desecrated him.\u201d According to the author of b\u2019chor shor, we must understand this as if the Torah had written: \u05dc\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d5, even if he is a High Priest.\u201d [The word \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc is being used by that commentator as \u201cthe highest authority,\u201d not only the husband, i.e. his wife\u2019s authority.

This is also why when we recite in our Mussaph on the festivals that offerings of bullocks were accompanied by three measures of fine meal for such offering, whereas two measures accompanied offers consisting of a ram, and one such measure accompanying offerings consisting of a sheep. When listing the accompanying libation offerings in that same prayer, the text does not mention the amount of wine for the libations of each such sacrifice beyond saying \u201cthe appropriate amount for each.\u201d When speaking of the libation for the \u201comer\u201d offering, the Torah writes: \u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05db\u05d4 in the feminine mode instead of \u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05db\u05d5, for Its libation offering\u201d in the masculine mode as it refers to the whole meal offering, the word for that offering being \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4, a feminine noun.

Some time later that same robber showed up at the entrance of the king\u2019s palace where the official who had been robbed by him stood guard. He enquired what brought this man to the palace and was told that he had a problem that he wished to submit to the king\u2019s judgment and he begged the official to support his request, or to hire someone to do so. He was then told by that official that as long as he had not made restitution for what he had stolen from him, there could be no question of his receiving any assistance. Thereupon the thief returned what he had stolen from this official. When on the morrow the erstwhile thief submitted his case to the king, the king asked him if he had anyone who could support his request. The petitioner pointed to the official and suggested that he could give testimony as to his character. When the king heard this, he turned to that official and asked him what he could have to say in favour of the petitioner. So the official proceeded to tell the king all that had happened between him and the petitioner. He pointed to some of the vessels that he had been robbed of, and which had been the king\u2019s property originally and which had been returned to him on the understanding that he, this official, would plead on the petitioner\u2019s behalf.

Of the Jewish people in the desert as well as the nations of the earth whom G\u2019d had sat in judgment of on the Day of atonement, see verse 13 in the same chapter of Psalms: \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05db\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d0 \u05dc\u05e9\u05e4\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u05d9\u05e9\u05e4\u05d5\u05d8 \u05ea\u05d1\u05dc \u05d1\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 \u05d5\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05d5, \u201cin the presence of the Lord, for He is coming, for He is coming to rule the Earth; He will judge the world fairly and its people in faithfulness.\u201d Both the Jewish people and the gentile nations have come up for judgment on that day, and we do not know which ones are the victors. G\u2019d advises us to hold the lulav in our hands, so that everyone will know that we have been acquitted. Tanchuma on this verse illustrates this by a parable. Two men appear before the king for judgment. The people on the outside have no idea which one of them was successful. All they know is that if one of them holds a cane or an apple in his hand when he emerges from the palace, he is the victor. The Jewish people, being modest, waited for five days before showing that they had been the victors in their confrontation with the gentiles.

It symbolises the righteous person who has both Torah learning and good deeds to his credit. The tree from which the palm frond has been taken provides fruit but does not provide fragrance. (Date palm) It symbolises the average Israelite, who, while having the performances of many commandments to his credit, has failed to acquire Torah knowledge, i.e. he does not exude fragrance. The myrtle branch, hadass, does not bear any fruit but provides us with a pleasant fragrance. It symbolises the person who did acquire Torah knowledge but did not translate it into the performance of its commandments. Finally, the willow branch, aravah, comes from a tree that neither provides fruit nor fragrance, (except shade). It symbolises the Jew who has neither acquired Torah knowledge nor acquired a list of merits for having performed good deeds. The reason that we bind all these four plants together before performing our ritual with them is, to demonstrate that we are aware that the Almighty does not really look down upon us with favour until we have managed to coexist peacefully, regardless of any shortcomings we perceive in one another. The prophet Amos 9,6 alludes to this concept when he wrote: \u05d4\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05ea\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d9\u05e1\u05d3\u05d4, \u05dc\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05e4\u05db\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u05d4' \u05e9\u05de\u05d5, \u201cWho built His chambers in heaven and founded His vault on earth; Who summons the waters of the sea and pours them over the land.\u201d On this verse, Midrash Rabbah comments that G\u2019d does all this when we, His people, form a united union. (Vayikra rabbah 30,12) Our author adds that it appears to him that this is also the reason why, on Rosh Hashanah, New Year\u2019s day, in our prayer describing the essence of the day we insert the line: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea, \u201cthey will all form a single band.\u201d A different explanation: The lulav symbolises the human backbone, \u05e9\u05d3\u05e8\u05d4.

Eventually, people who knew him concluded that he must have been descended from the tribe of Dan, a word which means: \u201cjudging.\u201d [This incident occurred many hundreds of years after the tribe of Dan and nine other tribes had been exiled, and no one could trace his antecedents to a particular tribe of the ten tribes whom the Assyrians had transplanted.

What was not clear was if, seeing that his mother was Jewish, he should be stoned to death (according to Jewish law) or if he should be put to death by the sword, the type of death penalty applicable to gentiles who are guilty of such a penalty. Some scholars, aware that when the penalty described by Jewish law is applied the person executed obtains atonement, felt that this person should be denied the opportunity of atonement after death, so that they wanted to kill him by a different method. An example of such a procedure is found in Leviticus 20,2, where a parent who kills one of his or her children by burning them as a sacrifice to the idol molech is executed by stoning, whereas if he did so to all of his children no penalty is spelled out. The Rabbis, perplexed why such a parent should not be punished, explained that the fact that no penalty is spelled out means that the parent guilty of this will be killed by a method which does not bring atonement for his sin in its wake. (Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin, folio 64). This is why the Torah here had to write that Moses had to make enquiries from G\u2019d concerning this. Something similar occurred with the man who collected kindling on the Sabbath, Numbers 15,32. The Torah had already spelled out the death penalty, but without specifying which of the possible four kinds of death penalties applied. This is why the man was first put in jail until the death penalty by stoning was decreed. Normally, when no further details are spelled out in the Torah the death penalty is by asphyxiation, \u05d7\u05e0\u05e7. The difficulty both here and in Numbers 15,32, is that according to Jewish law the guilty party must not only be warned about the impending penalty, but according to Rabbi Yehudah in the Talmud tractate Sanhedrin folio 8, must be warned about which kind of death penalty he would be facing, something that was impossible in both the examples we have cited. It is possible that he was given a warning that he would face one of four kinds of death penalties. Perhaps each one of them used this as an excuse by reasoning that such a warning was not legally valid and they would get away with their sin. There is also the problem that some of our sages feel that any warning which was based on some dubious language is invalid. (Talmud tractate Pessachim folio 63) It is hardly likely that under such circumstances there could be any convictions ever, as to find witnesses who had warned concerning 4 possible type of death penalties would presuppose that witnesses to a capital offence are all learned men. There is also an opinion in the Talmud that if a person who was considered a chaver, known for meticulous observance of the Torah\u2019s commandments, committed a serious sin, the fact that he had not been warned of the consequences is ignored, as he did not need witnesses to warn him not to do what he knew was forbidden and which penalty would await him (Sanhedrin folio 8)", "3": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e7\u05dc\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cany man who curses his G\u2019d, etc.;\u201d the reason why the attribute \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd is used here for G\u2019d, is that this law includes anyone cursing a Jewish judge.

The fact that this blowing of the shofar when required was performed by the priests is documented in Numbers chapter 10, verse 8. In order that we should not think that these laws were issued from the Tabernacle, the Torah added the words: \u05d1\u05d0\u05d4\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3, \u201cat the Tent of Meeting.\u201d\n", "1": "\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05ea \u05dc\u05da, \u201cyou shall count for yourself;\u201d at first glance we might think that this instruction to count concerns days and weeks just like during the days between Passover and the festival of Shavuot;\u201d if you were to say that we have Leviticus 15,28 where a similar construction is found in connection with a woman experiencing a vaginal discharge at times which do not coincide with her menses, we would have to say that the reason there is to teach us that the Torah warns her not to interrupt her counting during the days before she can regain ritual purity.

(Compare Rashi) We do indeed find a similar verse that during the period of the prophet Jeremiah, as recorded in Chronicles II 36,20, that the Israelites were forced to sell themselves as slaves to the gentiles in fulfillment of the prophecy of Jeremiah, who had stated that this situation would last until the soil of the land of Israel would once more find favour in G\u2019d\u2019s eyes, having paid back the sh\u2019mittah years it had been worked during the seventy years of the first exile.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5, \u201cand his redeemer arrives;\u201d  this is a reference to Hashem Who is the Redeemer.

In our verse the expression \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea-\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1, the house of his residence, is the same as if the Torah had written: \u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5, his residence, i.e. his house.

Why would 100 Israelites be able to put 10000 adversaries to flight, not 2000 as we would have expected from the first example given? We can understand this better when comparing the efficacy of a prayer said in the privacy of one\u2019s home, and a prayer said in the Synagogue when each person is part of a congregation. The latter prayers are far more effective, and presumably reach the throne of the Almighty more speedily. In Deuteronomy 32,30 Moses asked the rhetorical question of how it had been possible that under certain circumstances one gentile could put 1000 times his number of Israelites to flight, and only two enemies could put 10000 Israelites to flight? Besides, seeing that we have a tradition according to which blessings are always described as more powerful than corresponding curses, (Compare Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin, folio 100), how come Moses in Deuteronomy appears to paint the opposite of that scenario? Contrary to what we might think, that Moses in Deuteronomy 32,30 speaks about enemies chasing Israelites; he said that if the Israelites had only reasoned logically, they would have realised that the disproportionate numbers in both instances could only have occurred through direct intervention by Hashem. The gentiles had realised this in retrospect when the Israelites had fallen out of favour with their G\u2019d. Previously they had mistakenly credited the Israelites with superhuman abilities. The best example of this completely unbelievable performance in battle, is found in the Book of Judges 15,16, where Samson has been credited with killing one thousand Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass as his weapon. A similar feat of unbelievable military success is reported in the Book of Samuel, I chapter 14, where King Shaul\u2019s son Yonathan and his arms bearer, is credited with putting the Philistine army to flight, killing many on the way. Yonathan had seen a sign that G\u2019d was on his side by judging the Philistines\u2019 behaviour. [It is suggested that the reader read up that chapter in the Book of Samuel.

As far as this editor is concerned, the word: \u05d1\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea\u05d5, \u201cwhen it goes out\u201d (\u201cit\u201d in the masculine ending) is clear proof that the word \u05d4\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4 immediately before it must be of the masculine gender.

Rabbi Yehudah hachassid was able to answer a query raised  by many people concerning a statement in the Mishnah challah, chapter 2 mishnah 5, according to which if one separates flour (before it has become dough) as his priest\u2019s share of the dough it is not the priest\u2019s or priests\u2019 share of the dough, i.e. challah, and it would be as robbery in the hand of the priest; the reason cited there is that the Torah had written (Numbers 15,20) \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, \u201cof the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift;\u201d (not the first part of your flour) the question raised on the basis of this verse is: \u201cwhy do we not interpret the line in Deuteronomy 18,4: \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05d2\u05e0\u05da....\u05ea\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d5, \u201cthe first fruits of your corn....you shall give to him (the priest) in a similar manner?\u201d [The basic problem is how soon after the grain has been cut, can one declare part of it as intended for a specific priest. According to some opinions, this would be effective only after all stages of harvesting and storing have been completed. Ed.] The disagreement between the scholars centers around the meaning of the word \u05de\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8 \u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201ca tithe from anything that has been planted in the earth,\u201d and the more restrictive expression \u05d3\u05d2\u05e0\u05da, \u201cyour corn,\u201d i.e. something fully developed and harvested.\n", "2": "\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d4\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9, \u201cwhich Hashem had commanded Moses at Mount Sinai. It was sufficient for G\u2019d to entrust His messenger Moses with the task of instructing the Jewish people, seeing that the merits of the people of Israel were instrumental in his becoming such an outstanding intermediary \n"}}}
