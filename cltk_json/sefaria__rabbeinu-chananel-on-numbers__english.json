We also find this expression describing someone who has been deprived of all his possessions, remaining \u05e0\u05e7\u05d9, \u201ccompletely devoid of.\u201d (Baba Kamma 41) Compare also Isaiah 3,26 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e7\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1, \u201cshe shall be emptied, sit on the ground.\u201d"}, "1": "\u05de\u05d1\u05dc\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05da, in other words: \u201cleave him.\u201d"}, "1": {"0": "\u05de\u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d2\u05e4\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df, the Torah does not write \u05d2\u05e4\u05df without adding a modifier, as this could have led to confusion seeing that there are other kinds of \u05d2\u05e4\u05df such as \u05d2\u05e4\u05df \u05e9\u05d3\u05d4 from which we get certain wild gourds. (Kings II 4,39) The angel instructing Shimshon\u2019s mother regarding her abstaining from grapes and grape-based products also emphasises \u05d2\u05e4\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df, the vine from which wine is derived. (Judges 13,14) In that chapter the angel elaborates by telling Manoach\u2019s wife that she must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink wine or other intoxicant. He warns her once more to strictly adhere to his instructions. The instructions are couched in what is known in the rules of exegesis by Rabbi Yishmael as \u05db\u05dc\u05dc, general rule, followed by another \u05db\u05dc\u05dc followed by details, \u05e4\u05e8\u05d8.<br> The instructions to Shimshon\u2019s mother how to conduct herself during her pregnancy reflect the concept that the food we ingest is converted by the body into blood, whence it becomes milk, whence it is transferred to the baby in his mother\u2019s milk making an indelible imprint even on the baby\u2019s personality. Seeing that the type of Nazirite which Shimshon was supposed to be began while he was still a fetus in his mother\u2019s womb, as per the prediction of the angel there in verse 5, his mother had to abstain from all the things which a Nazirite has to abstain from.<br>Alternatively, there is a second general rule in that chapter, one which applied only to Shimshon himself and not to his mother, the requirement not to cut off any of the hair of his head. This rule had not been repeated by Manoach\u2019s wife to her husband when she told him about the angel\u2019s appearance. She had only told her husband that the son she would bear was to be a Nazirite all his life. When the angel returned a second time, he only spelled out what Manoach\u2019s wife was to abstain from. The only reason why the angel repeated some details was that the first time he had not told Manoach\u2019s wife to abstain from ritually impure foods, only from wine and intoxicating drink. On the first occasion he had not even forbidden Manoach\u2019s wife to eat grapes during her pregnancy. [perhaps the story is an illustration of what our sages teach that a \u201crepetition\u201d in the Scriptures automatically includes a new dimension which had not been mentioned the first time, so that in effect there is no such thing as a \u201crepetition.\u201d Ed.]"}, "2": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd, all these who ganged up on Moses and Aaron were from Korach\u2019s own tribe, i.e. Levites.

He repeated this instruction in verse 24, hoping that possibly, when the people observed how Moses and Aaron put space between themselves and the insurgents they would follow suit and do the same."}, "3": {"0": "\u05d9\u05e2\u05df \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05ea\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9, the sin consisted in their saying: \u05d4\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e1\u05dc\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 \u05dc\u05db\u05dd \u05de\u05d9\u05dd?, \u201cAre we to extract water for you from this rock?\u201d They should have said instead: \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4' \u05dc\u05db\u05dd \u05de\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cG\u2019d will extract water for you.\u201d (verse 10). In Exodus 16,8 Moses had been careful to phrase the announcement of the forthcoming phenomenon of manna by attributing it to coming directly from G\u2019d. Similarly, when predicting any of the other miracles which had been announce beforehand, Moses had carefully attributed the miracle to G\u2019d. By failing to do so this time they left the way open for some of the people to think that the water when it would gush forth would be the result of Moses\u2019 and Aaron\u2019s combined knowledge.<br>This is also the meaning of the words (Moses quoting G\u2019d) \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9, \u201cyou have not sanctified Me\u201d (Deuteronomy 32,51). On the first occasion, almost 40 years earlier, when water would be produced from a rock, (Exodus 17,6) G\u2019d had introduced the miracle by announcing: \u201cHere I will be standing there before you on the rock at Chorev. Strike the rock and water will issue from it and the people will drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\u201d The seventy elders had observed the cloud of glory moving to above the site of that rock so that the miracle became a public spectacle, lending additional greatness to G\u2019d\u2019s name  as the provider. In this instance the people did not observe any evidence of G\u2019d\u2019s involvement so that it was easy to conclude, based on Moses\u2019 and Aaron\u2019s phrasing it, that they themselves had initiated this phenomenon."}}}
