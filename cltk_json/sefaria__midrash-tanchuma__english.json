With black flame on white flame, as it is said (Song of Songs 5:11) \"his hair is wavy, black as a raven.\" What is meant by \u05e7\u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05ea\u05dc\u05ea\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd (\"his hair is wavy\")?

It is written in it [the Torah] (Lev. 22:32): And do not desecrate [\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5] My holy Name. If you change the [\u05d7] to a [\u05d4] you destroy the world ^(by making techalelu into tehalelu, and making the verse mean do not praise My holy Name). \"Every soul shall praise [\u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc] God\" (Psalms 150:6), if you change the [\u05d4] a [\u05d7] ^(techalel - shall desecrate) you destroy the world.

You should know, that back when Israel was enslaved in Egypt, Pharoah issued a decree that men could not sleep in their own homes, in order to make marital relations impossible.  Rabbi Shimon bar Halafta says, what did the women of Israel do?  They went down to the river [Nile] to draw water.  The Holy One of Blessing invited small fish to swim up into their vessels for them.  The women sold the fish, and with parts of the proceeds cooked food and took wine and went out to the fields.  There they fed their husbands, as it says, \"all of their labors were in the fields\" (Sh. 1:14).  As they were eating and drinking, the women opened up mirrors, gazing at themselves along with their husbands.  One [member of the couple] would say, \"I'm more beautiful than you,\" and the other would say, \"I'm more beauitful than you!\"  In this fashion, they re-accustomed themselves to sexual desire, and they were fruitful and multiplied.  The Holy One of Blessing made the women pregnant immediately.  Our teachers say, some women bore two in a single pregnancy.  And some say, six in each womb.  And some say, twelve in each womb.  And some say, 60 multitudes.  Those who say \"two\" base their interpretation on the phrase, \"were fruitful and swarmed\" (Sh. 1:7).  Those who say \"six\", on \"were fruitful and swarmed, multiplied and became mighty [in number], more and more\" (Sh. 1:7), so six [descriptors].  The one who says \"twelve\", \"fruitful\" is two [in the plural], swarmed is two, etc., so twelve.  The one who says, \"sixty multitudes\", it is because the verse says of fish, \"let the waters swarm\" (Br. 1:20), and thus uses the same term, \"swarm\".  And all of these accountings are because of the mirrors, because the verse says of them, \"the land was filled by them\" (Sh. 1:7).  And the more the people were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread out (Sh. 1:12).  By the merit of these mirrors, which the women used to make themselves visible to their husbands and to re-accustom them to sexual desire in the midst of enslavement, there were established all of the women's working-force [tz'ovot], as it says, \"all of ha-Shem's hosts [tziva'ot] went forth from Egypt\" (Sh. 12:41).  And it says, \"ha-Shem brought out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.\"  Therefore, when ha-Shem told Moshe to make the Mishkan, all of Israel arose and made voluntary contributions.  Some brought silver and some brought gold or brass and onyx stones and stones for setting, they enthusiastically brought everything.  The women said, what do we possess to give voluntarily to the Mishkan?  They arose and brought the mirrors, went alongside to Moshe.  When Moshe saw these mirrors, he raged against them.  He said to all Israel, raise up your staffs and shatter the women's desire for these.  The Holy One of Blessings said to Moshe, \"Moshe, against these you despise.  Yet these mirrors, they raised all of these hosts in Egypt.  Left them up and make from them a brass washing station and its brass pedestal for the priests, that from these [mirrors] the priests shall be sanctified.  As it says, \"They made the brass washing station and its brass pedestal from the mirrors of the women's working-force that was doing the work [tzav'u]\" (Sh. 38:8), that by means of these very mirrors, did all of these hosts [population] arise.  Therefore it is written, \"the brass for the offering [vessels] was seventy talents\" (Sh 28:29), brass of the vessels / brides.  The Holy One of Blessing said, in this world they were voluntary offerings for the Mishkan, to make atonement for them.  And in the future to come, I will grant atonement for them and will love them voluntarily, as it says, \"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them voluntarily\" (Hoshea 14:5).  They have said, for us, we have no Mishkan, no Temple.  May the prayer of our mouths be as the voluntary offering of the Mishkan.

The Holy One, Blessed is He says \"you guard the commandments and celebrate them, I will increase joy for you\", as it says (Isaiah 29:19) \"The humble also shall increase their joy in the LORD...\" [Beloved is circumcision, for The Holy One Blessed is He swore to Abraham that all who are circumcised will not descend to <i>Gehenom</i>, as it says (Genesis 15:18) \"In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying...\", and who descended to there? See what is says next (Genesis 15:19) \"the Kenite, and the Kenizzite...\". And so did Ezekiel see, as it says (Ezekiel 32:18-30) \"Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. Whom dost thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised... Asshur is there and all her company; their graves...  There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised... There are the princes of the north...\". And so did Isaiah say (Isaiah 5:14) \"Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, And opened her mouth without measure\" \u2014 to he that doesn't have a statute [the words \u05dc\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d7\u05e7 \u2014 \"without measure\" \u2014 can also be rendered \"to he that doesn't have the statute\"], and where [do we see that] it [the commandment to circumcise] is called a statue? As it says (Psalms 105:10) \"And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant\", because the Holy One Blessed is He placed His name with Israel. And what is the name and the seal that he placed in them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> [\u05e9\u05d3\u05d9], the <i>shin</i> [\u05e9] is placed on the nose, the <i>dalet</i> [\u05d3] on the hand, and the <i>yud</i> [\u05d9] on the [location of the] circumcision. Therefore when he goes to his eternal home, there is an angel appointed in the Garden of Eden who takes him and brings him into the Garden of Eden. And regarding the heretics and sinners, The Holy One Blessed is He commands the angel to pull his foreskin [i.e. reverse his circumcision], as it says (Psalms 55:21) \"He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; He hath profaned his covenant.\"]. It once happened that the evil Turnus Rufus asked Rabbi Akiva, \"which are the greater works, those of the Holy One Blessed is He or those of flesh and blood?\" He said to him, \"Those of flesh and blood are greater.\" Turnus Rufus said, \"But the Heavens and Earth \u2014 is Man able to make such as those?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him, \"Don't speak to me about something which is beyond Man, which he has no mastery over, rather speak of things which are found among people.\" He said, \"Why do you circumcise?\" He replied, \"I knew you were going to ask me about that, which is why I started by telling you that the works of Man are better than the works of the Holy One Blessed is He.\" Rabbi Akiva brought him stalks [of grain] and loaves [of bread]. He said to him, \"These are the works of the Holy One Blessed is He, and these are the works of Man.\" He said, \"Those are no better than than the stalks.' Turnus Rufus [then] said to him, \"If He wants circumcision, why does the infant not emerge circumcised from his mother's womb?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him ,\"And why does his umbilical chord emerge with him, [so] he hangs from the belly, and his mother [has to] cut it? And this that you said 'Why doesn't he emerge circumcised?', [the reason is] because the Holy One Blessed is He gave the Israel the commandments only in order to refine them [Israel] through them [the commandments].  And that's why David said (Psalms 18:31) (all) 'the word of the LORD is refined.'\""}, "2": {"0": "\u201cWhen you come into the land and plant\u2026\u201d This is what is written \u201cAnd I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind.\u201d (Kohelet 2:5) Doesn\u2019t all humanity plant anything which they desire?! Whatever a man plants in the earth it produces, whether pepper or anything else \u2013 if a man plants it, it grows! Rather, people do not know the proper place for each particular plant. But Shlomo, who was wise, planted all manner of trees [as it says \u201cAnd I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind\u201d]. R\u2019 Yannai said that Shlomo even planted pepper plants, and how did he plant them?! Shlomo was wise and knew the essential foundation (?) of the world. From where \u201cfrom Tzion the sum of all beauty Gd appears\u201d (Tehillim 50:2), from Tzion which includes within it the whole world. Why is it called the Foundation Stone? Because the whole world was founded from it. Shlomo knew which ligament extended to Kush and planted pepper on it, and it produced immediately, just as he said \u201cand I planted in them trees of every kind.\u201d Another explanation: \u201cand I planted in them fruit trees of every kind\u2026\u201d Just as the navel is placed in the middle of a man, so is the Land of Israel the navel of the world, as it says \u201cthose who sit on the center of the land (Ezekiel 38:12). The land of Israel sits in the middle of the world, and Jerusalem in the middle of the land of Israel, and the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem, and the palace in the middle of the Temple, and the ark in the middle of the palace and the Foundation stone before the palace (should this say before the ark \u2013 search for other versions!) from which the world was founded. Shlomo, who was wise, understood the roots that went out from it to the whole world and planted on them all types of trees, and therefore he said \u2013 I made for myself gardens and orchards."}}, "3": {"0": {"0": "Another interpretation: Why was [the Torah] given in the desert? Because if it were given in the Land, the tribe in whose area it was given would have said: I am most important. Therefore, it was given in the desert. Another reason it was given in the desert: Just like the desert is not planted and worked, so to is it with the one who accepts Torah upon himself. The yoke of rulership and the yoke of the ways of the world are removed from him. And just like the desert doesn't incur agricultural taxes, so to, men of Torah are are free men in this world. Another interpretation: Who fulfills the Torah? He who makes himself like a desert and detaches himself from everything.

And so too, in the incident of the spies, [the women] did not participate \"and when [the spies] returned, they caused all the congregation to murmur against [Moses]\" (Numbers 14:36), and they decreed a decree, as they said, \"we can not go up\" (Numbers 13:31), but the women were not in agreement with them, just as is written above regarding the matter: \"because God had said of them: 'they will surely die in the wilderness' and there was not left of them a man\" (Numbers 26:65) - \"a man\" and not a woman, for they did not want to enter to the Land, but the women became close by seeking a portion in the Land.
