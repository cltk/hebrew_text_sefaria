And because of this, when one prayed, his tongue was shortened to ask for his needs, or to give praise to the HKBH in the holy language until that their tongues were mixed up. And when Ezra and his Beit Din saw this was, they rose and instituted for themselves the 18 blessings in the order of three first praises to HaShem, and three last thanksgivings, and the middle there were in them requests on all the things that are like the foundations of every person\u2019s desires/needs, man to man.

Even if one makes an innovation in a single blessing, this is sufficient to show that it is a voluntary prayer, rather than an obligatory one. Yet the first three and last three [blessings] are never added to or subtracted from, and nothing in them is to be changed.
