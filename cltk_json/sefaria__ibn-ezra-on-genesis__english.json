But were that the meaning, the  <i>bet</i> would have been vocalized with a <i>kamatz gadol</i>. And there are those who say that [the word] <i>bereshit</i> always [appears in] attached [form], where the meaning is \u201cat the beginning of the evening, or the night, or the darkness\u201d. But behold, they forgot \u201che saw a beginning <i>reishit</i> for himself\u201d Devarim 33:21. And there are those who say that the  <i>bet</i> is a subject without meaning. Their reason is that it is unthinkable that there is no beginning to the heavens and the earth. Therefore, it said \u201c<i>bereshit</i>. But according to my opinion, it is indeed an attached form, like \u201cAt the beginning (<i>bereshit</i>) of the rule of Yehoyakim\u201d Yirmiyahu 26:1. Now don\u2019t wonder how can it be attached to a past tense verb [instead of a noun], for behold, thus: \u201cAt the beginning (<i>techilat</i>) spoke Hashem with Hoshea, and Hashem said to Hoshea\u201d Hoshea 1:2, \u201cThe city (<i>kiryat</i>) where David camped\u201d Yishayahu 29:1. The meaning [of this usage] will be explained for you in the second verse.", "1": "\u201cCreated\u201d \u2013 Most commentators have said that creation means bringing forth something from nothing, and thus: \u201cBut if Hashem will created a creation\u201d [referring to something never seen before] Bamidbar 16:30. But they have forgotten \u201cAnd G-d created the crocodiles\u201d Bereshit 1:21, as well as three times in the same verse: \u201cG-d created man in His image\u2026\u201d Bereshit 1:27; \u201cand Who creates darkness\u201d Isaiah 45:7 \u2013 which is the opposite of light, which is something. Now here is the precise grammar of the word  <i>barat</i> - it has two meanings. One is as stated. The other: \u201cHe did not revive them with bread\u201d Samuel II 12:17. In this second one, <i>aleph</i> is in place of  <i>hey</i>, for similar to it is \u201cAnd the whole people came to revive David\u201d \u2013 this is in the  <i>hif\u2019il</i> verb construction. If it were with an  <i>aleph</i>, it would be like \u201cTo revive you from the beginning of every grain-gift of Yisrael\u201d Samuel I 2:29. We also find [the same root] in the  <i>pi\u2019el</i> verb construction: \u201cYou will clear for yourselves there\u201d Joshua 17:15. It\u2019s not like \u201cchoose for yourselves a man\u201d Samuel I 17:8, rather like \u201cAnd He BARAed them\u201d Ezekiel 23:47. And its meaning is to cut, to place a divided border \u2013 and the enlightened will understand.", "2": "\u201cE-lohim\u201d \u2013 After we have found [the word] <i>e-loah</i>, we know that   <i>E-lohim</i> is its plural form, and the root [of this] is in the nature of language. For every language has a formal form. The way of expressing formality in non-Hebrew languages is by the lesser using the plural in the presence of the greater. In Arabic the way of formal expression is for the greater to speak, as royalty, in the plural. In the Holy Tongue, the way is to refer to the greater in the plural.  Like \u201cmaster\u201d (<i>adonim</i>), \u201cowner\u201d <i>b\u2019alim</i>  as the said, \u201ca harsh master\u201d (<i>b\u2019alim</i>) Isaiah 19:4, \u201chis master (<i>b\u2019alim</i>) shall take\u201d. Likewise the word \u201cupon him\u201d (<i>alav</i>), \u201cto him\u201d (<i>elav</i>), \u201cuntil him\u201d (<i>adav</i>). For this reason does Scripture state \u201cHe created\u201d and not \u201cthey created\u201d. Now from a perspective of wisdom, we know that speech is called \u201clip\u201d [Hebrew parallel to the English \u201ctongue\u201d] since people see that words emanate from there. Likewise, the supernal human soul is called \u201cheart\u201d, yet the heart is [part of the] body, since the heart is the first \u201cchariot\u201d for it. Now is called thus [\u201c(<i>E-lohim</i>)\u201d)since all the acts of Hashem are [delivered] into the hands of the angels, who do His Will. (I will explain a bit more of the secret of the Name on the verse \u201cfor My Name is within him\u201d \u2013 Exodus 23:21). And pay no attention to the words of [Rav Sa\u2019adiah] <i>Ga\u2019on</i> who said that man is more prestigious than angels.  I\u2019ve already explained in <i>Sefer HaYesod</i> that all his proofs are actually the opposite. Now we know that, amongst men, there are none more prestigious than the prophets, yet Yehoshua fell on his face before an angel of Hashem and prostrated himself, and said, \u201cwhat is my master speaking to his servant\u201d \u2013 Joshua 5:14. and likewise Zechariah and Daniel, but why should I go on? And the meaning of \u201cG-d of hosts\u201d is like \u201cG-d of gods [masters]\u201d. So the meaning of <i>E-lohim</i> is like \u201cking\u201d, and people who are involved in divine law will be called thus \u2013 but it is an adjective [lit. descriptive name], not a [true] noun \u2013 you won\u2019t find any future or past forms. And don\u2019t think that, since we find it written, \u201cHe makes the winds His angels\u201d that  angels are [made] from fire and wind, for that is not the straightforward way of interpreting that verse. It\u2019s rather that David spoke initially of the work of creation, beginning with light and saying, \u201cHe enwraps [in] light\u201d and afterwards \u201cHe spreads out the heavens\u201d \u2013 that is, the firmament, with the waters above it, and fire, snow and wind. He [then] said that the wind is Hashem\u2019s messenger to go to any place He may send it, likewise is fire amongst His servants, and he said, \u201cHe founded the earth upon its elements\u201d \u2013 this is regarding the dry land. Likewise is it written, \u201cthe stormy wind does His will\u201d Psalms 148:8", "3": "The meaning of <i>et</i> is like the thing itself, yet indicating a direct object, like <i>et hashamayim</i>, and sometimes it is omitted, as in \u201csince G-d created man\u201d [with the  direct object indicator missing] \u2013 Deuteronomy 4:32. And at times it\u2019s [even] found with the subject, as in \u201cthe lion came and <i>et</i> the bear\u201d \u2013 Samuel I 17:34, but there are few of these. It can [also] be in place of \u201cwith\u201d and in place of \u2018from\u201d.", "4": "\u201cThe heavens\u201d \u2013 with the definite article, to indicate that that it\u2019s speaking of those [heavens] which are visible, and [\u201cheavens\u201d] are always plural. And it's possible that it means, \"its domain\" \u2013 the domain of each one. The meaning of \u201cheavens\u201d is heights and elevation, and thus it is in Arabic, which is primarily based on the Holy Tongue. There are also \u201cheavens of heavens\u201d, but there is no singular form, like <i>rechayim</i> [\u201cmillstones\u201d] and <i>tzohorayim</i> [\u201cafternoon\u201d]. People of stature will understand these secrets. Now the <i>Ga\u2019on</i> says that the earth is like a point, and the heavens are like a thread encompassing it, and after these two were created, were everything within them [created], like water and fire. Others have said that the water was included with the earth, and the wind with the heavens. According to my opinion, these heavens and earth are [identical to] the firmament and the dry land, for only one things was created on each day: on the first day, light; on the second day, the firmament; on the third day, plants; on the fourth day, the luminaries, of the fifth day, and on the sixth day, the living things. The psalm mentioned [above] bears witness. And it\u2019s impossible for the line which surrounds to precede the point, or for the point to precede the line, so therefore did they say that the heavens and the earth were created simultaneously. Bearing witness is \u201cI call to them, they stand up together\u201d \u2013 Isaiah 48:13.  Yet this proof is not [sufficiently] clear, for this is not the explanation of the verse, for how can He say \u201cto them\u201d when they are not!? And how can He call it <i>tohu</i>? Rather, its meaning is \u201cI created them\u201d, and at the time I call to them, they will both stand up before Me like servants to do My will\u201d, as in \u201cYour word is standing in the heavens\u201d \u2013 Psalms 119:89. And afterwards he mentioned the earth, afterwards stating that both will arise to execute judgment as He commands them."}, "1": {"0": "\u201cAnd the earth\u201d \u2013 this word is an unusual [form], since it appears with a <i>kamatz</i> in the <i>alef</i> when [preceded by] the <i>hey</i> [i.e., the definite article] in all places. It is not like \u201cThe thousand (<i>ha\u2019elef</i>) for you, Shlomo\u201d Song of Songs 8:12, or \u201cand this stone <i>ha\u2019even</i>\u201d Genesis 28:22.", "1": "\u201cVoid\u201d (<i>tohu</i>) \u2013 The <i>Ga\u2019on</i> [Rav Sa\u2019adiah] said that [this word] is from \u201cdeep\u201d (<i>tehom</i>), but that is not possible, since the <i>mem</i> of <i>tehom</i> is a root letter, like the <i>mem</i> of <i>hadom</i>. Now in  <i>Sefer Yetzira</i>: \u201c<i>tohu</i> - this [refers to] the green line\u201d, and <i>bohu</i> - this [refers to] MEFULAM stones\u201d. What\u2019s correct is as the Aramaic translator has said, and likewise with \u201cthe howling, desolate <i>tohu</i> Deuteronomy 32:10, and likewise, \u201cafter <i>tohu</i>\u201d Samuel I 12:21 \u2013 without substance.

The meaning is [as follows:] The creation of the firmament and the dry land was not in a area to be settled, since it was covered with water, and thus G-d placed its generative power to be beneath the water. Now don\u2019t be surprised by the <i>vav</i> of <i>veha\u2019aretz</i> (\u201cand the earth\u2019), for its meaning is like the <i>feh</i> in Arabic and like \u201cand a mist\u201d <i>v\u2019ed</i> would rise up from the earth\u201d Genesis 2:6, for Moshe did not speak about the World to Come, which is the world of the angels, but rather of this transitory world. And those who explain that the heavens in the first verse are really the heavenly heavens, what will they do [here] with the earth? Behold, complete proofs, for reasonable people, that there is only earth. Now it is expounded that there were seven earths is [actually] that the earth is divided into seven and the Temple was in the center of the settled region, for it was distant from the center of the earth.

But if this was so, it would have been appropriate for there to have been light [from the beginning, without darkness]. Rather, it\u2019s in accordance with its [plain] meaning. And thus, \u201cBy the word of G-d were the heavens made\u201d Psalms 33:6,  \u201cfor He commanded and they were created\u201d Psalms 148:5, The meaning is: a way of referring to an effortless action, comparable to a king and his servants.

The meaning of \u201cone day\u201d is referring to the rotation of the sphere. There is a secret to the <i>midrash</i> of six thousand. And after it has said that the light is called day, it isn\u2019t possible that the evening should be called day, rather its explanation is \u201cit was evening and also morning of Day One\u201d, for if it was [referring to] the evening and morning(g of one day, what would be the meaning of \u201ca second day\u201d?", "5": "\u201cAnd He said\u201d, the <i>Gaon</i> said regarding the firmament (<i>raki\u2019a</i>) things that could not be; rather its explanation is \u201cextended\u201d, like \u201cthey were extended\u201d (<i>vayerak\u2019u</i>) Exodus 39:3, \u201cI shall extend them\u201d (<i>erka\u2019em</i> Samuel II 22:43, and similarly, \u201cand He stretched them [i.e., the heavens] out like a tent for dwelling\u201d.

Now this firmament is the atmosphere, for when the light coalesced over the earth and a dry wind from the earth, the blade/flame was changed and became the firmament. And thus did it say in a Psalm Psalms 104:2 \u201cHe stretches the heavens like a curtain\u2026 the one who makes roofbeams of water\u201d.

Now revealing a hidden thing and gathering that which is scattered is not creation [per se] (<i>beri'ah</i>). The meaning is then, \"G-d had already said, let the the waters be gathered\", and there are hundreds of similar usages in the Torah.  In <i>parashat Bereshit</i> alone I will give you two witnesses. The first: \"And He placed there [in the Garden] the man whom He had formed\", while afterwards, \"And Hashem, G-d, caused to grow [from the ground every tree...]\" - but before [placing] man had He caused it to grow. The second witness: He commanded man not to eat from the tree of knowledge, and afterwards it is written, \"And Hashem, G-d, formed from the ground...\" - rather, its explanation is, \"He had already formed\".

And likewise, \"the heavens of the heavens\", \"for the one who rides in the heavens of the heavens of yore\" <i>kedem</i> - where <i>kedem</i> here does not signify \"east\". Now the <i>gaon</i> Rav Sa'adia (may the memory of a righteous individual be for blessing), fled from this place [i.e., did not expound this].

And likewise regarding the moon and starts, their light is not seen in the day. Now if one should ask, behold the the astronomers have said that Jupiter and all the planets except for Mercury and Venus are larger than the moon, so how can it write \"the great ones\" [including the moon]? The answer is that \"the great ones\" does not refer to their physical measure, but rather to their light, and the light of the moon is many times greater, due to its being close to the earth, and therefore is it written \"luminary\".", "14": "<b>And He placed</b> - Do not be astonished over the word \"and He placed,\" for it is also written, \"My bow have I placed\" (Genesis 9:13).", "15": "\"and to rule\" - the day of the Torah is from the hour that the sun rises until its setting, and the night is from the time of seeing the stars, and they were correct who said: at the word of three witnesses.

Its meaning [would be]: G-d created man in his [own] image, where the <i>vav</i> [i.e., the pronominal suffix] refers back to man. And they would [further] explain: In the image of G-d, that the word \"G-d\" is attached to the word \"made\", as though it said that G-d made man in an image. But this is an explanation which lacks sense [<i>haser lev</i>], for the first passage should then have been thus: \"And G-d said, 'let man be made'\", and likewise, He made him \"in his image\" - how can \"his\" (the <i>vav</i> of <i>b'tzalmo</i>) refer to man, for then, he would have had an image before he would be [created]! And [further], what reason would there be [in the verse] such that \u201cthe one who spills the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed\u201d \u2013 because man was made in his own image? There was an image for all living creatures! Now the <i>Gaon</i> said that me explanaion of \u201cin our image, after our likeness\u201d is regarding dominion. The meaning [of the verse] would [then] be: in the image that He as as good and appropriate though wisdom. And due to the honor owed man, the text attributes it to G-d, and likewise [with the verse] \u201cand from his land did he go forth\u201d Ezekiel 36:20, for to Hashem is the earth and its fullness. And he said [further] that the word <i>na\u2019aseh</i>, though it is in plural, is the manner of royal speak [i.e., the plural of majesty].

But these witnesses are false witnesses, for  <i>nitnah</i> is [actually] the <i>nif\u2019al</i> verb construction, and similarly \u201cthe city is given\u201d <i>nitnah</i> Jeremiah 32:24, and the <i>vav</i> converts it to the future tense, like is the rule with all past-tense verbs, meaning \u201cshe will be given to you\u201d. And \u201cwe shall smite him\u201d \u2013 he [Balak] and his camp, or it could be the infinitive of the verb, like \u201cclease <i>nakeh</i>, I shall not clease you\u201d Jeremiah 46:28. And even though we do find \u201cthey were not smitten\u201d Exodus 9:32, [nevertheless], only that verb construction (<i>pu'al</i>) lacks an infinitive form \u2013 and R. Moshe of Spain erred in his book [on this matter]. And the word \u201cwe shall say (before the king)\u201d Daniel 2:37 is Aramaic, and [further], how could Daniel speak hautily with Nebuchadnezzar, who was the king of kings? Now I shall explain: Know that all of the work of creation was created for the honor of man at the command of Hashem. The plants \u2013 the earth and the water brought them forth, and all the living souls [i.e., the animals]. And afterwards, Hashem said to the angels, \u201clet US make man\u201d \u2013 WE will busy ourselves with him, not the water and the earth. Now, since we know that he Torah speaks in the language of human beings, for the one who speaks is [as it were] a human [character], as well as the one who listens, and one cannot speak to one above or below his level, except by means of human imagery. Likewise, it says, \"the mouth of the earth\", \"the hand of the Jorden [river]\", \"the head of the ores of the earth\", and G-d forbid there should be [attributed] a physical form to Hashem, for thus it says: \u201cto whom shall you compare Me?\u201d Isaiah 25. Now since the human soul is most exalted, for it is immortal, it is compare in it livingness to Hashem, who is not corporal yet fills everything. Now the human body is like a microcosm. May G-d we blessed, Who began with the great and concluded with the small. Likewise did the prophet say that he saw the glory/manifestation of G-d like the image of man (see Ezekiel 1:28). Now Hashem is one, and He creates all, and He is all, and I cannot expound this further. Man was initially created as a dual-faced creature and yet he is one, and yet he is also two, and behold, an angel is in the image of G-d. He was created male and female. The word for \u201cfruitfulness\u201d and \u201cmultiplication\u201d is a blessing, as with the creation of water, yet it is [also] a command as transmitted by our ancient [Sages], (may their remembrance be a  blessing!), and they used this verse as a mnemonic for this [matter].", "21": "And G-d said, \u201cBehold, I have give to you\u201d \u2013 He permitted humans and to all which have a living soul [i.e., animals] to eat all grasses; all fruit is permitted to humans, and grasses to all beasts and creeping things. To this point, meat has not been permitted [and will not be] until after the flood.", "22": "\"The sixth day: - there are those who say that that it is juxtaposed [to another noun, i.e., referring to something other than \"day\"] - the meaning being \"the sixth heavenly orb\". And likewise [we could explain]  \"the seventh day\" Genesis 2:3. But this is not true. And the referent of \"the sixth day\" [the planet associated with the sixth day] would prove this. Rather, its explanation is \"a day which is sixth to the first day. Likewise for \"the seventh day\".

But the Torah did not detail all the years after he left Ur Kasdim.  And after it says, \u201cthat I will show you,\u201d He revealed to him the secret.  That\u2019s why it says, in Chapter 11, \u201cThey went out to go to the Land of Canaan.
