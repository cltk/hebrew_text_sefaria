In the name of Rabbi Israel Ba\u2019al Shem, on the verse Issachar is a strong-boned [garem] donkey: that is to say, there is reward [s\u2019khar] by way of that which the \u201cdonkey\u201d causes [gorem]. (Tzava'at HaRivash  p.12b)", "1": "In the name of the Ba\u2019al Shem Tov, this is the explanation: \u201cThere is reward that the \u2018donkey\u2019 [hamor] causes,\u201d meaning by way of food and drink, which are physical [homer] matters, he causes this reward \u2013 by way of his elevating to the Cause of Elevation the holy spark  that was crouching down between the stables, which was among the lower elements. (Or HaGanuz le-Tzadikim,  Vayehi)", "2": "It is stated in the Talmud: \u201cThe Torah has mercy on Israel\u2019s money\u201d (Rosh HaShanah 27a), and why so? Because this is an important principle, that whatever thing a person wears, or eats, or uses as a tool \u2013 he benefits from the life-force that is within that thing;  for without the spirituality that thing would have no existence, and there [in the thing] are holy sparks relevant to the root of his soul. And I heard that for this reason there is a person who loves a certain thing, and there is a person who hates that thing and loves another thing; and when he uses that tool, or eats foods even for his body\u2019s needs, he fixes the sparks.  For afterward he serves [God],  with that same power that comes to his body from that food or clothing or other things, with that power he serves Blessed God, and we find that through this [the sparks] are fixed. Therefore sometimes it happens that when he has already finished fixing all the sparks that were in that thing, which were related to the root of his soul, then Blessed God takes that tool from him and gives it to someone else, since the sparks that [remain] in that tool are relevant to a different root. And Rabbi Israel Ba\u2019al Shem, peace be upon him, said that people eat and people drink and people use [tools],  meaning the sparks that are in those things; therefore a person must be sensitive about his tools and everything else that he has, meaning from the side of the sparks that are within them, in order to have mercy on the holy sparks. (Tzava'at HaRivash p.13a)"}}}
