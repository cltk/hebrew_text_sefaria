As the text says \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory... \" And even if his Evil Inclination advises him in the winter and says 'How will you arise in the morning, because it is very cold?' or in the summer advises and says 'How will you arise from your bed, when you still have not slept to your satisfaction?' Overcome him and do not listen to him, and think to yourself: If I had needed to arise to appear before a king of flesh and blood, how carefully and zealously would I arise and awaken in order to prepare myself for this service?

", "1": "(2) THE DAWN - A secret in written in the Two Tablets of the Covenant, to connect the day and night with Torah and prayer, whether its morning or whether its evening. Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he is does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and Torah.

There are those who are accustomed because of this to have parchments of a Menorah drawn inside their Siddurim, on which it is written \"I shall set the Lord...\" Etc..., with the Four Letters and other Names, and this Menorah is called \"I have set\" [\"Shiviti\"]. And the purpose is in order to remind one not to engage in idle chatter during God fearing prayer. And it is written in the Gates of Repentance [Sha'arei Teshuvah] ", "4": "(5)  BEFORE MEN - Never the less, he should never fight with them, because the quality of brazenness is very despicable, and its not appropriate to use it at all, even in the service of the Lord blessed be his name, because he the will acquire the attribute in his personality even in matters which are not in the service of Hashem.

If its possible for him to perform it not directly in their presence, its even better. However, if you're in the presence of other average folk who would learn from him, then on could say, that it would be better to do it in their presence, so that they should learn from him how do as he has done. However, he should direct his heart [intention] to the Name of the Heaven, but not boastfully God forbid. ", "6": "AND WHEN HE IS ALONE - It means to say, even when he is in the privacy of his home, also he should be walking with the Lord his God, as [the Re'ma] concludes...", "7": "WITH ALACRITY - Not exactly, bur rather he should wait a bit and not get up immediately, because it is damaging for the body. It is good to say immediately upon rising \"I am gratefully to you my eternal king who has returned my soul in kindness; great is your faith.\" It should be said with a pause after \"kindness\", and \"great of your faith\" without pause. And this is from as its written \"renewal of mornings\" etc..., that the Holy One Blessed be He upholds his faithfulness to returns the souls to its depositor in the morning.
