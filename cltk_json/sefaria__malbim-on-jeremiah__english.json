That maybe the nation will become angry with what he says and come upon him and kill him. "}}, "1": {"0": "In his days \u2013 It says that in the days of the Messiah \u2018Yehudah will be saved\u2019, for in the time of the Second Temple they were not really saved because they were subjugated by Persia, Greece and Rome. And Israel, which refers to the ten tribes, \u2018shall dwell safely\u2019 because in the time of the Second Temple the ten tribes did not return: his name that he shall be called He will then be called \u2018the Lord is our righteousness\u2019 because our righteousness is the Lord, as it says \u201c\u2026O God of my righteousness\u2026\u201d (Tehillim 4:2) meaning that my righteousness will come from the God \u2013 just as He exists so too Israel will be righteous and saved by God. This prophecy is repeated further on in 33:15, with some changes. It says \u2018I will cause to grow for David a plant of righteousness\u2019 but does not mention \u2018and he shall reign a king and prosper.\u2019 There it is written \u2018In those days, Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely and this is the name that He shall call it, the Lord is our righteousness.\u2019 This is because there are two manners of redemption. If it comes through our merit \u2018I will hurry it,\u2019 if it is not through our merit \u2018in its time\u2019 (see Isaiah 60:22 and gem. Sanhedrin 98a). It further says there in the gemara: if it is through our merit \u2018and behold with the clouds (ananei) of the heaven, one like a man was coming\u2019 (Daniel 7:13) and if not \u2018humble (ani), and riding a donkey.\u2019 (Zechariah 9:9) Here in chapter 23 the prophet is speaking about redemption that comes through merit, which is why is says \u2018I will set up of David a righteous shoot,\u2019 meaning that he will be righteous through his merit. In chapter 33 the prophet is speaking about redemption which comes not through our merit, which is why it says \u2018In those days and in that time I will cause to grow for David a plant of righteousness,\u2019 because the supernal righteousness will not look at the acts of righteousness and merit, but rather will act out of generous kindness and through an arousal from above, as I explained in Yeshayahu 29. Therefore it does not say \u2018I will set up of David,\u2019 but rather \u2018I will cause to grow for David,\u2019 because it will be a new growth. This is not the case for redemption brought on through merit, there it says \u2018I will set up\u2019 because the growth will exist already through the merit of his actions and God will simply lift it up from its fallen state. Further in chapter 33 the prophet adds \u2018In those days and in that time\u2019 because if it is not through merit we will have to wait until the appointed time. This is not the case here in chapter 23, it does not say \u2018in that time\u2019 because \u2018I will hurry it.\u2019 So too it does not say in chapter 33 \u2018and he shall reign a king and prosper\u2019 because if it is not through merit then he will not reign right away, but rather he will be \u2018humble, and riding a donkey.\u2019 Further, it doesn\u2019t say there \u2018and Israel shall dwell safely\u2019 because if we do not merit the tribes will not be gathered in right away, rather only Yehudah and Jerusalem will be saved. The ingathering will be delayed until Jerusalem is rebuilt first. It does not say in chapter 33 \u2018and this is its name\u2019 in reference to Jerusalem because it will not have this name already due to our lack of merit, \u2018this is the name that He shall call it\u2019 Jerusalem from now forward. But here in chapter 23 where it describes redemption through our merit it says \u2018and this is his name\u2019 because he will have already acquired this name through his merit."}, "2": {"0": "For there is a day \u2013 Because in the beginning they places guards on Mount Ephraim to prevent Israel from coming up to Jerusalem, the day will come when they place watchmen and guards who will cry out \u2018Rise! Let us go up to Zion.\u2019 They will keep watch in the opposite fashion, because everyone will bringt he fruits of the fourth year up to Jerusalem to eat them there."}}}
