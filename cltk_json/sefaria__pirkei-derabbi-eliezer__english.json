His father had many ploughmen who were ploughing arable ground whereas he was ploughing a stony plot; he sat down and wept. His father said to him : O my son! Why dost thou weep? Art thou perchance distressed because thou dost plough a stony plot? In the past thou hast ploughed a stony plot now behold thou shalt plough with us arable soil.- He sat down on the arable ground and wept. His father said to him : But why dost thou weep? Art thou perchance distressed because thou art ploughing the arable land ? He replied to him : No. (Hyrkanos) said to him : Why dost thou weep ? He answered him : I weep only because I desire to learn Torah. (Hyrkanos) said to him : Verily thou art twenty-eight years old \u2014 yet dost thou desire to learn Torah? Nay, go, take thee a wife and beget sons and thou wilt take them to the school.' 'He fasted two weeks not tasting anything, until Elijah may he be remembered for good \u2014 appeared to him and said to him : Son of Hyrkanos! Why dost thou weep ? He replied to him: Because I desire to learn Torah. (Elijah) said to him : If thou desirest to learn Torah get thee up to Jerusalem to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. He arose and went up to Jerusalem to R. Jochanan ben Zakkai and sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him: Why dost thou weep? He answered him : Because I wish to learn Torah. (R. Jochanan) said to him : Whose son art thou? But he did not tell him. (R. Jochanan) asked him : Hast thou never learnt i to read the Shema, or the Tephillah, or the Grace after meals ? He replied to him : No. He arose and (R. Jochanan) taught him the three (prayers). '(Again) he sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him : My son, why dost thou weep? He replied : Because I desire to learn Torah.' He (thereupon) taught him two rules (of the Law) every day of the week, and on the Sabbath (Eliezer) repeated them and assimilated them. 'He kept a fast for eight days without tasting anything until the odour of his mouth attracted the attention of R. Jochanan ben Zakkai, who directed him to withdraw from his presence. He sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him : My son, why dost thou weep ? He rejoined : Because thou didst make me withdraw from thy presence just as a man makes his fellow withdraw, when the latter is afflicted with leprosy. (R. Jochanan) said to him : My son, just as the odour of thy mouth has ascended before me, so may the savour of the statutes of the Torah ascend from thy mouth to Heaven. He said to him : My son ! Whose son art thou ? He replied : I am the son of Hyrkanos. Then said (R. Jochanan) : Art thou not the son of one of the great men of the world, and thou didst not tell me ? By thy life! he continued, This day shalt thou eat with me.- (Eliezer) answered : I have eaten already with my host. (R. Jochanan) asked: Who is thy host ? He replied : R. Joshua ben Chananjah and R. Jose the Priest. (R. Jochanan) sent to inquire of his hosts, saying to them: Did Eliezer eat with you this day? They answered: No; moreover has he not fasted eight days without tasting any food ? 'R. Joshua ben Chananjah and R. Jose the Priest' went and said to R. Jochanan ben Zakkai : Verily during the last eight days (Eliezer) has not partaken of any food. ", "1": "The sons of Hyrkanos said to their father: Get thee rip to Jerusalem and vow that thy son Eliezer should not enjoy any of thy possessions. He went up to Jerusalem to disinherit him, and it happened that a festival was being celebrated there by R. Jochanan ben Zakkai. All the magnates of the district were dining with him ; (such as) Ben Zizith Hakkeseth,- Nicodemus ben Gorion, and Ben Kalba S'bu. Why was his name called Ben Zizith Hakkeseth? Because he reclined at table in a higher position than the other magnates of Jerusalem. Concerning Nicodemus ben Gorion, people said that he had (stored) provisions containing 3 S'ah of fine flour for every inhabitant of Jerusalem. When the  zealots' arose and burnt all the storehouses, they measured and found that he had had provisions for three years for every inhabitant in Jerusalem. Concerning Ben Kalba S'bu'a it was told that he had a house measuring 4 Kors with roofs covered with gold. The people said (to R. Jochanan) : Behold, the father of R. Eliezer has arrived. He bade them saying : Prepare a place for him, and seat him next to us. (R. Jochanan) fixed his gaze on R. Eliezer, saying to him,' Tell us some words of the Torah. (R. Eliezer) answered him saying : Rabbi! I will tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this well which cannot yield more water than the amount which it has drawn (from the earth); likewise am I unable to speak words of the Torah in excess of what I have received from thee. (R. Jochanan) said to him, I will (also) tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this fountain which is bubbling and sending forth its water, and it is able to effect a discharge more powerful than what it secretes  in like manner art thou able to speak words of the Torah in excess of what Moses received at Sinai. (R. Jochanan) continued: Lest thou shouldst feel ashamed on my account, behold I will arise and go away from thee. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai arose and went outside. (Thereupon) R. Eliezer sat down and expounded. His face shone like the light of the sun and his effulgence beamed forth like that of Moses, so that no one knew whether it was day or night. They went and said to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai: Come and see R. Eliezer sitting and expounding, his face shining like the light of the sun and his effulgence beaming like that of Moses, so that no one knows whether it be day or night. He came from (his place) behind him and kissed him on his head, saying to him : Happy are ye, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because this one has come forth from your loins. Hyrkanos his father said : To whom does (R. Jochanan) speak thus ? The people answered : To Eliezer thy son. He said to them : (R. Jochanan) should not have spoken in that manner, but (in this wise), \" Happy am I because he has come forth from my loins.\" Whilst R. Eliezer was sitting and expounding, his father was standing upon his feet. When (Eliezer) saw his father standing upon his feet, he became agitated and said to him : My father ! be seated, for I cannot utter the words of the Torah when thou art standing on thy feet. (Hyrkanos) replied to him : My son, it was not for this reason that I came, but my intention was to disinherit thee. Now that I have come and I have witnessed all this praise ; behold thy brothers are disinherited and their portion is given to thee as a gift. (Eliezer) replied : Verily I am not equal to one of them. If I had asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for land, it would be possible for Him to give this to me, as it is said, \" The earth is the Lord's, and the fidness thereof\" (Ps. xxiv. 1). Had I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for silver and gold, He could have given them to me, as it is said, \" The silver is mine, and the gold is mine \" (Hag. ii. 8). But I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, that I might be worthy (to learn the) Torah only, as it is said, \" Therefore I esteem all precepts concerning all things to be right ; and I hate every false way \" (Ps. cxix. 128). ", "2": "R. Eliezer BEN Hyrkanos opened (his discourse with the text), \"Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord, or shew forth all his praise?\" (Ps. cvi. 2). Is there any man who can utter the mighty acts of the Holy One, blessed be He, or who can shew forth all His praise?' Not even the ministering angels are able to narrate (the Divine praise). But to investigate a part of His mighty deeds with reference to what He has done, and what He will do in the future (is permissible), so that His name should be exalted among His creatures, whom He has created, from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, \"One generation to another shall laud thy works\" (ibid. cxlv. 4). Before the world was created, the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Name - alone existed, and the thought arose in Him to create the world. He began to trace (the foundations of) the world before Himself, but it would not stand. They told a parable. To what is the matter like? To a king who wishes to build a palace for himself. If he had not traced in the earth its foundations, its exits and its entrances, he does not begin to build. Likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, was tracing (the plans of) the world before Himself, but it did not remain standing until He created repentance. Seven things were created before the world was created. They are : The Torah, Gehinnom, the Garden of Eden, the Throne of Glory, the Temple, Repentance, and the Name of the Messiah. Whence do we know that this applies to the Torah? Because it is said, \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old\" (Prov. viii. 22). \"Of old\" means before the world was created. Whence do we know this with regard to the Garden of Eden ? Because it is said, \"And the Lord God planted a garden of old\" (Gen. ii. 8). \"Of old,\" whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know this with reference to the Throne of Glory? Because it is said, \" Thy throne is established of old\" (Ps. xciii. 2). \"Of old,\" whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know this with regard to the Temple? Because it is said, \"A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary\" (Jer, xvii. 12). \"From the beginning,\" whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know  that Repentance (was premundanc)? Because it is said, \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the Earth and the world\" (ibid. xc. 2); and then in close proximity (we read), \"Thou turncst man to contrition\" (ibid. 3). \"Before,\" i.e. before the world was created. Whence we do know that the name of the Messiah (was premundane)? Because it is said, \"His name shall endure for ever; before the sun Yinnonwas his name\" (Ps. Ixxii. 17). \"Yinnon,\" before the world had been created. Another verse says, \" But thou, Bethlehem Ephrathah, which art to be least among the thousands of Judah, from thee shall he come forth unto me who is to be ruler over Israel ; whose ancestry belongs to the past, even to the days of old '\" \" (Mic. v. 2). \" The past,\" ^ whilst as yet the world had not been created. Porthwith \" the Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with the Torah whose name is Tushijah (Stability or Wisdom) with reference to the creation of the world. (The Torah) replied and said to Him : Sovereign of the worlds! if there be no host for the king and if there be no camp for the king, over Avhom does he rule? If there be no people to praise the king, where is the honour of the king? The Holy One, blessed be He, heard this and it pleased Him. The Torah spake : The Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with me concerning the creation of the world, as it is said, \"Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge; I am understanding; I have might\" (Prov. viii. 14). Hence they say. Every government which has no counsellors is not a proper government. Whence do Ave know this? From the government of the House of David which employed counsellors, as it is said, \"And Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe\" (1 Chron. xxvii. 32). If the government of the House of David had counsellors, how much more so should other people act likewise. This is of benefit to them, as it is said, \"But he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise\" (Prov. xii. 15), and (Scripture) says, \"But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety\" (ibid. xi. 14).", "3": "... R\u2019 Meir said: there was a single pearl suspended in the belly of the fish which gave light for Yona like the sun at its strength in the midday and Yona could see everything that was in the sea and the deeps as it says, \u201cA light is sown for the righteous\u2026\u201d (Tehillim 97:11) The fish said to Yona, \u2018don\u2019t you know that my day has come to be fed into the mouth of Leviathan?\u2019 He replied, \u2018take me to him and I will save you and myself from his mouth.\u2019 He brought him to Leviathan and he (Yona) said to him, \u2018Leviathan! For your sake I descended, to see your dwelling place in the sea and further more I am prepared to come down and place a rope in your tongue and to bring you up to the great feast of the righteous. He showed him the seal of Avraham (saying) \u2018look at the sign of the covenant!\u2019 Leviathan saw Yona and fled before him two days journey. He (Yona) said to it (the fish), \u2018behold, I saved you from the mouth of Leviathan! Now show me what is in the sea and the deeps. It showed him the great river of the waters of the ocean as it says, \u201c\u2026and a river surrounded me\u2026\u201d (Yona 2:4) It showed him the paths of the Red Sea through which Israel passed as it says, \u201c\u2026the weeds were wrapped about my head.\u201d (Yona 2:6) It showed him the place from which the breakers and waves of the sea come forth as it says, \u201c\u2026all Your breakers and waves passed over me.\u201d (Yona 2:4) It showed him the pillars of the earth on their base as it says, \u201c\u2026the earth with her bars closed on me forever\u2026\u201d (Yona 2:7) It showed him the lowest part of the netherworld as it says, \u201c\u2026yet you have brought up my life from the pit\u2026\u201d (ibid.) It showed him Gehinnom as it says, \u201c\u2026out of the belly of She\u2019ol I cried\u2026\u201d (Yona 2:3) It showed him underneath the palace of Gd as it says, \u201cI went down to the bottom of the mountains\u2026\u201d (Yona 2:7) From here we learn that Jerusalem stands on seven mountains. And he saw there the foundation stone fixed in the deeps, and he saw there also the sons of Korach standing and praying for it. They said to Yona, \u2018behold, you are standing under the palace of Gd \u2013 pray and you will be answered immediately!\u2019 He said to the fish, \u2018stop where you are because I want to say a prayer.\u2019 The fish stopped and Yona began to pray before the Holy One saying, \u2018Master of all the worlds! The One who is called bringer of death and giver of life! Behold, my soul has arrived at death \u2013 give me life! He was not answered until the following came out of his mouth, \u2018that which I vowed I will fulfill! My vow to bring up Leviathan and to prepare him before you I will fulfill on the day of Israel\u2019s salvation as it says, \u201cBut I will sacrifice to You with a voice of thanksgiving\u2026\u201d (Yona 2:10)  Immediately the Holy One gestured to the fish and it vomited Yona up onto the dry land as it says, \u201cAnd the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Yona\u2026\u201d (Yona 2:11) And the sailors saw all the signs, miracles and great wonders that the Holy One did with Yona and they arose and cast aside each one his gods as it says, \u201cThey that guard lying vanities forsake their loyalty.\u201d (Yona 2:9) They returned to Yafo, went up to Jerusalem and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins as it says, \u201cThen the men feared the Lord greatly and offered a sacrifice to the Lord\u2026\u201d (Yona 1:16)  And did they actually offer sacrifice?! Rather this refers to the blood of the covenant of circumcision which is like the blood of sacrifice. Then each one vowed to bring his children and all he had to the Gd of Yona. They vowed and fulfilled and because of them one calls converts righteous converts.", "4": "... Adam looked to above and below . . . and he saw the creatures/b\u2019riyot that the Holy One had created and he began to glorify the name of his Creator and he said, \u201cHow diverse are Your works Hashem\u201d [Ps 104:24]. He stood on his feet and was described/proportioned/m\u2019to\u2019ar in the likeness of Elohim. The creatures saw him and they were afraid of him, as they thought that he created them, and all of them came to bow down to him. He said to them: \u201cYou\u2019ve come to bow down to me? Come, I and you, and we will go and clothe in majesty and strength and make rule over us . . . the one who created us . . . Adam went and made Him rule over himself first and all the creatures after him and they said: \u201cHashem ruled, clothed in majesty\u201d [Ps 93:1].", "5": "... Adam and his partner / `ozro came and cried [over Hevel (Abel)], and they did not know what to do . . . One raven whose companion died said: I will teach Adam this is what to do. He set down his friend and dug in the earth before their eyes and buried him. Adam said: Like the raven, this is what we will do.", "6": "... Said the Holy One [to Avram]: Up until now you have not been whole before me, but circumcise the flesh of your foreskin \u2018and be whole/tamim\u2019 [Gn 17:1].", "7": "... \u2026R\u2019 Yehudah says \u2018for twenty years Rivka was barren. After twenty years Yitzchak took Rivka and went to Mount Moriah, to the place where he had been bound. There he prayed for her that she should become pregnant and Gd heard his prayers, as it says \u201c\u2026and the Lord accepted his prayer\u2026\u201d (Bereshit 25:21) The children were struggling within herlike mighty warriors, as it says \u201cAnd the children struggled within her\u2026\u201d (Bereshit 25:22) It came time for her to give birth and the pain of labor brought her to the point of death. She went to pray in the place where she and Yitzchak had prayed, as it says \u201c\u2026And she went to inquire of the Lord.\u201d (ibid.) What did the Holy One do? Yaakov grabbed the heel of Esau to throw him down, as it says \u201cAnd afterwards, his brother emerged, and his hand was grasping Esau's heel\u2026\u201d (Bereshit 25:26) From here one can learn that the children of Esau will not fall until the remnant of Yaakov come and cut off the feet of the children of Esau from Mount Seir, as it says \u201cJust as you saw that from the mountain a stone was hewn without hands\u2026\u201d (Daniel 2:45) and \u201cVengeance is poised with Me, and it will pay at the time their foot stumbles\u2026\u201d (Devarim 32:35)", "8": "... R\u2019 Yehudah said: all three of the forefathers made a covenant with the peoples of the land \u2013 Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. When did Avraham make a covenant with the peoples of the land? When the three angels were revealed to him, he thought that they were travelers and ran to greet them. He wanted to make them a great meal, and told Sarah to prepare a feast. At that very moment she had a flow of menstrual blood, and therefore he did not serve the guests the bread which she prepared. Then he ran to bring a calf, but it fled from him and went in to the Machpela cave. Avraham went in after it, and found Adam and Chava lying on their biers asleep, with candles burning around them, and a good smell upon them, like the sweet smell of an offering. Therefore desired the cave as a burial plot. He said to the Yevusi that he would buy the Machpela cave at a good price, for gold and with a deed, as an eternal burial plot. And were they Yevusi? Were they not Hittites?! Rather, on account of the name of the city, Yevus, they are called Yevusi. The people did not accept his offer. Avraham began to kneel and bow down before them, as it says \"And Avraham bowed himself down before the people of the land\" (Bereshit 23:12). They said to him \u2018we know that in the future the Holy One will give you and your descendants all of these lands. Swear to us that Israel will not take possession of the city of Yevus without the consent of the Yevusi. Afterwards he purchased the Machpela cave for gold and with an eternal deed for everlasting possession. \u201cAnd Abraham listened to Ephron\u2026\u201d (Bereshit 23:16) What did the people of Yevus do? They made bronze idols and set them up in the city square and wrote Avraham's oath on them. When Israel came to the land, they ran to enter Yevus but they could not because of the covenant made by Avraham, as it is said \u201cAs for the Yevusi, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Yehuda could not drive them out\u2026\" (Yehoshua 15:63). When David became king he wanted to enter the city of the Yevusi and they did not allow him, as it is said \"They spoke to David, saying, you shall not come in here\u2026\" (Shmuel II 5:6). Israel was numerous like the sand at the sea, but because of the power of the oath and Avraham's covenant they could not enter. David saw this and retreated, as it says \u201cAnd David dwelt in the stronghold\u2026\u201d (Shmuel II 5:9) (They said to him) You are not able to enter into the city of the Yevusi until you undo all of these idols upon which the sign of the covenant and oath of Avraham are written, as it says \u201c\u2026unless you remove the blind and the lame\u2026\u201d (Shmuel II 5:6) They did not enter the Holy Temple, Gd forbid, rather these were idols with eyes that did not see and legs that could not walk. This is why it says \u201c\u2026the lame and the blind, despised by the soul of David\u2026\u201d (Shmuel II 5:8) because David hated to see or hear any idolatry, as it says \u201cTherefore they say: \u2018The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\u2019 (ibid.) David said to his men \u2018anyone who goes up first and removes these idols upon which are written the sign of the covenant Avraham made will be my chief officer, and Yoav ben Tzruriah went up first and became his chief officer. Afterwards David purchased the city of the Yevusi on the behalf of all Israel for gold, with an eternal deed as an everlasting possession. What did he do? He took fifty shekel from each tribe, which makes six hundred altogether, as it says \u201cAnd David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred.\u201d (Divre HaYamim I 21:25)", "9": ".......Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, forty days did Moshe spend on the mountain - he read the doctrine of Scripture during the day and reviewed the doctrine of Scripture at night. And after forty days, he took the tablets and went down to the camp, and on the seventeenth of Tammuz he broke the tablets and killed the scorners of Israel. And he spent forty days in the camp, until he he burned the [golden] calf and ground it down like the dust of the earth, and killed all those who kissed the calf he expunged idol worship from Israel; and he set every tribe up in its place. And on Rosh Chodesh (the beginning of the month of) Elul, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (Exodus 24:12), \"go up to Me to the mountain.\" And they blew the <i>shofar</i> (rams's horn) in the camp - since behold, Moshe went up to the mountain - such that they not err again after the worship of idols. And the Holy One, blessed be He, was exalted on that day with that <i>shofar</i> [blast], as it is stated (Psalms 47:6), \"God is exalted by the <i>shofar</i>.\" And therefore, the Sages, ordained that we should blow the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh Chodesh Elul in each and every year...."}}
