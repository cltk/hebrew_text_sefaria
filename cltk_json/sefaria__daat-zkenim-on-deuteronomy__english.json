(Compare D\u2019varim Rabbah 1,2.) Our author elaborates with a parable. A prince had two ministers, one of whom he loved and the other he had grown to hate. He cautioned the minister whom he loved not to commit any misdemeanours, as if such would come to the attention of the King he would be severely punished, the king not exercising any mercy. He encouraged the minister he hated to live his life without restraints as even if he did become guilty of a misdemeanour he had someone at court who would intervene on his behalf. Moses acted similarly; seeing that he loved Israel, he warned them not to become guilty not to follow the wrong path as this would lead to disaster for them. (Deut. 11,16) Bileam, on the other hand, seeing that he hated Israel, would praise them, hoping that in their exuberance they would commit acts through which they would forfeit the goodwill of their heavenly Father. Concerning the Jewish people, Bileam had said in Numbers 23,19: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0-\u05dc \u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05d6\u05d1, \u201cG\u2019d is not like man who threatens and relents,\u201d in dealing with the gentile nations He never relents; but when dealing with the Jwewish people, \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05de\u05e0\u05d5, \u201ceven though He had expressed verbally His wrath and threatened punishment, in the end He will not carry out what He had threatened.\u201d (same verse) Concerning the Jewish people, Solomon said in Proverbs 27,6: \u05e0\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e2\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0, \u201cwounds inflicted by a loved one are long lasting; the kisses of an enemy are profuse.\u201d Concerning Moses, Solomon said in Proverbs 24,25: \u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05db\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05e0\u05e2\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05ea\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1, \u201cbut those who rebuke the wicked will experience delight; blessings of good things will come upon them.\u201d You will note that Solomon does not conclude with the word \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cupon him,\u201d the rebuker, but he uses the plural mode, \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd, \u201cupon them,\u201d i.e. the ones who have been rebuked.", "3": "\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05df \u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05df, \u201cbetween Paran, Tofel and Lavan;\u201d Words of \u05ea\u05d9\u05e4\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea, critique, against the manna which was white in colour.

This would have been a slap in the face to G\u2019d, rather than to the sinful Israelites. When the Torah describes Israelites falling victim to their enemies in these paragraphs we must not confuse this with reports of ordinary battles. It appears that what Moses refers to in our verse is what reported in Numbers 21,4: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d1\u05d9, \u201cthe Canaanites took some of them captive.\u201d When in verse 3 of that chapter, the Israelites were praying to G\u2019d on this account, He responded, and they concluded this military encounter with the Canaanites successfully."}, "1": {"0": "\u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05db\u05dd, \u05e1\u05d5\u05d1, \u201cyou have been skirting this land enough, now turn around (in a northerly direction) The word \u05e8\u05d1 here is used in the same way as Esau used it in his encounter with Yaakov in Genesis 33,9 when he first wanted to refuse to accept Yaakov\u2019s gift and said to him:\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9  \u201cI have lots, my brother;\u201d he meant that he had been repaid sufficiently for any harm Yaakov had caused him in the past.", "1": "\u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e6\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1, \u201cdo not harass Moav.\u201d G\u2019d had to warn the Israelites not to harass Amon, Moav and Seir, as they thought that they were legally entitled to inherit the lands of those nations. Seir appears under the heading of Chivvi in numerous places, and it was one of the tribes that G\u2019d had told Avraham in Genesis chapter 15 that his descendants would inherit. This is why the Torah wrote in verse 12 of our chapter that originally the lands occupied at that time were inhabited by a tribe known as Chorim, and that the Edomites, i.e. Seir, had dispossessed the original owners, and did not occupy it legally, so that it was not included in what G\u2019d had spoken about to Avraham in Genesis chapter 15. The \u201dChivvi\u201d was not a separate nation among the seventy nations that we read about after G\u2019d destroyed the Tower and mixed up the languages, but a sub-species, such as there were five such among the Midianites, each with a king of their own. Also Ammon and Moav occupied land previously owned by the Re-faim,\u201d(verse 11) so that although the soil was part of what is known to us as \u201cPalestine,\u201d that section was not included in what G\u2019d had promised to Avraham as lands his descendants would inherit in chapter 15. The Moabites themselves had referred to these people as Eymim, i.e. not ethnically part of them. Some of these \u201cnames,\u201d were merely acquired names describing how others related to them, i.e. Eymim\u201d are people that inspire Eymah, fear, in those who encounter them. Most of these \u201cnations\u201d were extraordinarily powerful human specimens not only physically but also mentally. This is why they were compared to Anakim, \u201cgiants.\u201d G\u2019d did not have to warn the Israelites not to harass the Canaanite tribes who dwelt on their original land, not having engaged in wars of expansion.\n", "2": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d7\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d6\u05d4, \u201cand the Avvim who dwelled in villages as far south as Gaza.\u2019 Moses now elaborates where the Chivvi is located. The letters \u05d7 and \u05e2 are used interchangeably. Do you want to know where to find the Chivvim? They dwell in chatzerim, They were so powerful that they did not bother to live in cities surrounded by a security wall, as they relied on their physical prowess to protect them. The land called: eretz refa-im, was identical with the kingdom of the giant Og, (3,13) it had been promised to Avram and by now the time had come to inherit it and to settle there. However, the land of Moav which the latter had taken away from Eymim, who were giants like the Refaim, are not identical with the Refa-im that G\u2019d promised to Avram, seeing that Moabites called them by a different name,; also the land now occupied by the Ammonites who had dispossessed the Zamzumim and were not the same Refaim as the ones who had lived there hundreds of years earlier.", "3": "\u05de\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05ea, \u201cfrom the wilderness of K\u2019demot.\u201d This means that the region in question had been a barren desert before G\u2019d had decided to produce water from the rock Moses had struck. Seeing that most of the territory ruled over by Sichon during Moses\u2019 time used to belong previously to either Moav or Ammon, both nations whose territory was out of bounds for the Israelites, they offered to traverse it peacefully. The territory ruled over by Og, which previously was occupied by the Refaim, was not the subject of such an offer by the Israelites. No peace offering under any conditions other than the population relocating themselves was extended to any of the seven Canaanite tribes. They were also not eligible for conversion to Judaism. A different interpretation of the words: \u05de\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05ea. G\u2019d had explained to Moses that legally speaking, instead of sending Moses and Aaron to warn Pharaoh to release His people, He was entitled on the basis of their record to kill the Egyptians without any warning at all. Nonetheless, He went out of His way to offer them a chance to rehabilitate themselves. (Exodus 8,15) The same was true at Mount Sinai, prior to G\u2019d revealing Himself to the Israelites and giving them His Torah. He knew full well that the Ishmaelites or Edomites when offered the Torah would reject it out of hand; nevertheless, He went through the motions of offering it to them. (Compare Deuteronomy 33,2) Here too, Moses emulated what he had learned from G\u2019d and dispatched messengers to ask for permission to traverse the land of Sichon, offering economic benefits to him such as offering to pay for water, although the Israelites had their own supply of water. According to our sages, Moses actually sent two letters to him. In one letter he offered peaceful relations. In the second letter he warned him that if that offer were to be turned down the Israelites would declare war upon him and his nation. According to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Moses did not waste two letters on Sichon, but in the first section of his letter he offered peaceful relations, whereas in the second half he spelled out that the alternative would be war. He based himself on Psalms 120,7: \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05d4, \u201cwhen I offer peace, they are nonetheless bent on war.\u201d Considering this, G\u2019d told the Israelites that because these people were bent upon war against you I will let you inherit their land in peace, as we know from Psalms 37,11: \u05d5\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd, \u201cbut the lowly shall inherit the land and delight in abundant well-being\u201d.\n"}, "2": {"0": "'\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d7\u05e0\u05df \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4, \u201cI pleaded with the Lord. The holy tongue knows of seven different names, each referring to a different category of prayer. They are as follows: \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4, \u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, \u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4, \u05e4\u05d2\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4, \u05e8\u05e0\u05d4, \u05e6\u05e2\u05e7\u05d4, \u05d6\u05e2\u05e7\u05d4. Of all the types of prayer at the disposal of Moses, why did he choose only one category, i.e. \u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4? When Moses had asked G\u2019d to reveal more of His attributes, especially His method of dealing with sinners, in Exodus 33,13, after answering Moses in part, He had concluded with: \u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05df, (verse 19 there) He made it clear to Moses that whenever and howsoever He forgives a sinner or reduces the punishment for which that sinner is in line, it is a gift a \u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4. It is not something that the recipient had a claim to. Moses wanted G'd to know that though he pleads, he is aware that even if G\u2019d responds favourably to his plea, he will never forget that this would be an outright gift rather than something he had been entitled to. Letting him cross the Jordan would be an outright gift. (Compare Tanchuma, section three on our parshah). Another reason for Moses\u2019 choice of the word: \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d7\u05e0\u05df, is that the numerical value of the letters in that word \u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 we quoted from Exodus 33,19, is the same as that of \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d7\u05e0\u05df.", "1": "\u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05da, these words introduce G\u2019d\u2019s reply to Moses\u2019 plea which had been based on G\u2019d having released Moses from a vow given to his father-in-law Yitro not to circumcise one of his sons. (as explained by Rashi according to Yalkut Shimoni on our portion item 814.) [Since the author of the Midrash lived at least 100 years after Rashi\u2019s death he could not have quoted him. Ed.] G\u2019d reminded Moses that no one could cancel his own vows. He had been able to do this for Moses, as He was his superior. Since He, G\u2019d, had no superior to do this for him, He could not comply with that request. Yet another way of understanding the words \u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05da , with which G\u2019d tells Moses to desist from continuing with his plea: G\u2019d quotes words which Moses had used when denying Korach his request to be elevated to the priesthood.<br> \u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05da \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8. [I am summarising Moses\u2019 plea and G\u2019d\u2019s reply. In order to appreciate what follows the reader is advised to read chapter 40 in Job. Ed.] Moses quotes G\u2019d, Who had described him as closer to Him than any previous human being and had made a covenant with him. He hints that G\u2019d is reneging on that covenant if he has to die before crossing the Jordan. G\u2019d replies that mortality has been decreed on every human being, dating back to the time when Adam had sinned, and that He therefore cannot violate that decree by making an exception for him. His time had come to die, and it was therefore futile for him to implore G\u2019d further."}, "3": {"0": "'\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5, \u201cdo not add, etc.;\u201d G\u2019d implies that anyone adding to the words of the Torah,-however well meaning he may be,-will in fact detract from the value of the Torah. [If G\u2019d is perfect, something that every believing Jew accepts as axiomatic, any addition to or deletion from His Torah would make it, ergo Him, imperfect. Ed.] For instance, when the Torah decreed 4 strings of tzitzit for the corners of a four-cornered garment, adding a fifth string would not only not make it holier, but would make it useless, and anyone reciting a benediction over such a tallit would desecrate the holy name of G\u2019d by pronouncing such a benediction. The same reasoning applies to sitting in a sukkah for an extra day or adding another a fifth species to a lulav.", "1": "'\u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5, \u201cwhen you beget children etc.\u201d Moses warns the people not to take their settlement in the land of Israel for granted even after they have lived there for several generations. Their tenure in the land is contingent on their continuing to observe the Torah and all of its commandments. If they failed to do, not only would they endanger their tenure of the land, but they would endanger their continued existence as G\u2019d\u2019s people. [If, say after six generations in the Holy Land, the people who had not been witnesses to all the miracles G\u2019d had performed before the first generation settled in that land, they would claim that there was no reason why their tenure is linked to Torah observance, just as their neighbour\u2019s tenure to their respective lands is not contingent on a set of laws of their religion, Moses warns them against such a fatal error. Ed.

When they heard this they broke out in a song of relief. This was remindful of the proverb that (only) if someone has tasted a dish does he really know what it tastes like. Moses, who had had cursed an Egyptian who had slain a Jew by using the holy name of the Lord, had been forced to flee and reside outside his homeland for close to 60 years.

Another king possessed a vineyard in the northern part of Israel, whereas his residence was in the central part of the country. Each king had to travel at least once a year from his residence to his vineyard to make sure the vineyard was being tended properly.

Furthermore, He is obligated to make good on the promise He made to your forefathers. If you were to argue then that if He loves us as a father loves his children, why should we burden ourselves with having to observe all His commandments? The answer is that His patience extends until one thousand generations in searching for one that merits His keeping the oath He has given to your forefathers.

This is also what David had in mind in Psalms 49,6 when he said: \u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e8\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9, \u201cwhy should I be afraid of trouble in days to come \u2013seeing that I have fulfilled the most difficult commandments?-He answers rhetorically, \u201cI have reason to be afraid of being punished for trespassing the commandments that are so easy to fulfill as it is to put one heel behind another.\u201d Our sages in Ethics of the Fathers chapter 2 mishnah 1, warn us to be as meticulous to fulfill the commandments which are easy to fulfill as we are with fulfilling the commandments which are difficult and expensive to fulfill. Something along the same line has been written in Proverbs 5,6 where Solomon warns: \u05d0\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4\u05df \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05e1 \u05e0\u05e2\u05d5 \u05de\u05e2\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d3\u05e2 \u201cshe (the immoral woman who is the subject here) does not chart a path of life; her ways are unstable; you do not know them.\u201d Solomon warns us not to apply our yardsticks to different commandments and taking credit for the ones we performed with a great deal of effort, while neglecting to fulfill the ones we considered as unimportant. We have no way of knowing how G\u2019d values the performance of different commandments, so that we do not know what rewards are in store for their performance. This can be illustrated best by a parable. A king had an orchard; he brought workmen to that orchard to plant trees and did not tell them how much he would pay each for each tree that they planted. If he had told them beforehand which planting would be paid for most, he would find at the end that only half the orchard had been planted with trees, as the workers would, of course, all plant the trees for which they would be paid the most.", "1": "According to Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, G\u2019d revealed the reward of only two of all the commandments; one is the commandment which is the easiest to fulfill, the other is the commandment which is the hardest to fulfill. Honouring father and mother is the easiest commandment to fulfill, it can be fulfilled several times daily without special effort. The other is the sending away of the mother bird when one plans to take the chicks it had hatched or was about to hatch. Both of these commandments are rewarded with same reward, long life of the person who fulfills them. The reason is that G\u2019d wanted to show the world that there are commandments which we think must carry a great reward, and others which precisely because they are so easy to fulfill, and the opportunity to fulfill them is ever present, so that we might have thought that they cannot carry much of a reward.

Ed.]"}}, "6": {"0": "\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4, \u201cAll the instruction, etc.\u201d our author understands the word \u05db\u05dc in our verse not so much as \u201call,\u201d i.e. each and every, but as \u201cthe whole commandment.\u201d Once you have begun to fulfill a commandment you must complete what you have undertaken. This rule has been spelled out specifically in the Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah, chapter 1, halachah 8. The text is: when someone has commenced to perform a commandment he is told to complete it. If someone has commenced to perform a commandment and it is completed by someone else, the last person gets the credit for having performed it. The source of this ruling is traced to Moses who had commenced the commandment of transferring Joseph\u2019s remains to the land of Israel, (Exodus 13,19) but who could not complete it as he never crossed the Jordan. The credit for burying his remains in the land of Israel is therefore given to the Jewish people, as we know from Joshua 24,32: \u201cand the Children of Israel buried Joseph\u2019s remains which they had brought with them from Egypt, and they were interred in the city of Sh\u2019chem on a plot of land which his father Yaakov had acquired for the price of 1000 kessito as spelled out in Genesis 37,27. This plot became an ancestral heritage to the tribe of Joseph.\u201d (Compare Babylonian Talmud, tractate Sotah) folio 13. Rabbi Sh\u2019muel bar Nachmani is quoted in the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 13, as saying that if someone commences to fulfill a commandment but fails to complete it (not by circumstances beyond his control), he will wind up burying his wife and his children. He adds that we know this from Yehudah (Yaakov\u2019s son) compare Genesis 37,26, who said: \u201cwhat profit is there in killing our brother Joseph.\u201d Yehudah, of course buried both his wife and two of his sons, as we read in Genesis 38, 7-12. Some scholars add that this was why the brothers demoted him as we know from the beginning of that chapter. Instead of saving Joseph, the brothers sat down to eat their meal, and in the interval Joseph was taken out of the pit by Ishmaelites and sold as a slave. Yehudah said that they could not pronounce benedictions of G\u2019d while planning to commit murder of their brother. They therefore interrupted, and sold Joseph, before they sat down again to eat. Yehudah is perceived as having begun to save Joseph from death but not having brought him back safely to his father. The Torah had testified that the brothers listened to him, so that it could be assumed that they would also have agreed to bring him back to his father.

When he was about to enter a certain country he had to cross a river and in the process the king\u2019s seal with his authorisation fell into the water and when retrieved proved to have become illegible.

Moses saw the golden calf the people had made and as a result he broke the Tablets. Imagine a king who had become engaged to be married to a certain lady, having told her that he would send her the marriage certificate, ketuvah\u00b8 after a certain period of time, using his best man as the messenger. By the time the document had been written and he had found his best man, he found out that the lady was not worthy to become his wife. What did he do? He tore up the marriage certificate. His reasoning was that it was in that lady\u2019s interest instead of becoming an unfaithful wife after the marriage ceremony, to remain unmarried when her conduct was subject to a lesser penalty. The same happened with the relationship between G\u2019d and Israel at that time. Israel had become betrothed to G\u2019d at time of the revelation at Mount Sinai. The Tablets were meant to be the marriage document that He would give His people forty days later. When Moses saw how corrupt they had become in the interval, he decided that it was in their best interest to tear up the marriage document, i.e. the Tablets, so as to make their legal status less serious than if they had committed adultery after the wedding ceremony.

After all, they had been the most precious gift the people had ever been meant to receive. This is also what Kohelet had in mind when he said in Kohelet 3,1: there is a time for everything, a time for every imaginable \u201cthing.\u201d There was a time when the Tablets had to be smashed, and there was another time when new Tablets had to be made.

It would be his reward for performing that work. It would enrich Moses as the \u201cstone\u201d from which he hewed these tablets were sapphires. There is a disagreement between the sages about where Moses had been able to find those sapphires. According to Rabbi Levi, Moses found this under the throne of G\u2019d; according to the opinion of Rabbi Chanan, he found it beneath his tent. The source of this discussion is found in Song of Songs 5,14: \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1, \u201chis arms are rods of gold, are studded with sapphires overlaid with ivory.\u201d i.e. the tablets, i.e. the commandments were arranged five on each tablet.

This was the ark that the Israelites took with them when they went out to war as we know from Numbers 10,33. and which travelled three days march in front of them during the journeys in the desert. It was the ark made by Moses before he ascended Mount Sinai, not the Ark that Bezalel made for a furnishing of the Tabernacle. Originally, he had placed the broken Tablets in that ark as well as the second set of Tablets, as the commandment to construct a Tabernacle, etc. had not yet been given. We have read this in verse five of our chapter. Construction of the Tabernacle had begun only after Moses had descended from the Mountain for the third time and it was not completed or consecrated until the beginning of Nissan of the second year in the desert. At that time the Tablets were transferred to the golden ark covered by the golden lid with the cherubs that we read about in Exodus 25,16. This Ark was not taken out of the Tabernacle even during wars as we know from Samuel I 4,7 and 8: during the war around Shiloh, against the Philistines, when the two sons of Eli the High Priest took the golden ark with them to help them in the war and the Philistines captured it, [though it brought only harm to them wherever the placed it so that they sent it back after six months. Ed.] Our sages are on record as ruling that at any time when this ark and G\u2019d\u2019s Presence which it symbolised was not in the place assigned to it, the Israelites were not allowed to indulge in marital relations with their wives. During the incident between David and Uriah hachitti, in Samuel II 11,11, when David sent him home on furlough to his wife to engage in marital intercourse, the latter\u2019s refusal to do so was considered an unjustifiable hardship he imposed upon himself, while ordinary soldiers when on leave did have marital relations. [The soldiers in David\u2019s army had given their wives pro forma divorce decrees before going into battle so that their wives would be able to remarry if they died and their remains had not been identified. Ed.] When the Ark accompanied Joshua during the war of conquest of the Holy Land, this was at the direct command of the Lord. In both instances the reference was to the ark Moses had constructed and which contained the broken Tablets. When the Talmud in Baba Batra folio 14 speaks of the broken Tablets and the second set of Tablets that were kept in the Ark, the reference is clearly to the Ark made by Betzalel. But this refers to the Ark in Solomon\u2019s Temple, after it had found a permanent resting place. In the Jerusalem Talmud we do find that there is a disagreement about whether during that period there were still two arks.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05e0\u05e1\u05e2\u05d5 \u05de\u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05df, and the Children of Israel had journeyed from Beer Yaakon;\u201d according to the plain meaning of the text Mossera is not the same place as Mosserot in Numbers 33,3, and bney yaakon is not the same as yaakon in that chapter.

Moses had to wait on the Mountain for forty days, and by Yom Kippur it had been one hundred and twenty days since the day that the people had danced around the golden calf. The first time Moses ascended Mount Sinai was on the seventh day of Sivan, the day after G\u2019d had revealed the Ten Commandments. He ascended in order to receive the Ten Commandments in Tablet form, and he was taught the whole Torah during the forty days that he spent on the mountain. He descended on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, on the day he smashed the Tablets. On the following day he ascended again in order to plead for forgiveness for the people. (Compare Deut. 9,18) These 40 days were completed on the twenty eighth day of the month of Av. G\u2019d then instructed him to hew out the stones for the second set of Tablets, and he ascended again on the twenty ninth day of that month. At that time Moses told the people that the following day would be the 30th day of Av, and that it would already be considered as the Rosh Chodesh for the month of Ellul, combined with the day following, officially known as the first of Ellul. On that day the people were to start blowing the shofar daily so that they would not miscalculate the day on which he would return from the mountain as they had done the first time which resulted in the catastrophe of the golden calf. The Jewish people, in commemoration of this, still blow the shofar starting on the first day of Ellul, i.e. actually the thirtieth day of the month of Av, for a total of forty days. The forty days are made up as follows: 1 day in the month of Av, 29 days in the month of Elull and 10 days in the month of Tishrey, concluding on Yom Kippur, the tenth day of that month. It became the norm ever since that the Rosh Chodesh of the month of Ellul is observed for two days. It was on the tenth day of Tishrey that G\u2019d said to Moses that He had forgiven the sin of the golden calf, so that Moses descended from the mountain on the following day. The seventeenth day of the month of Tammuz during that year had occurred on a Thursday. Passover and the seventeenth day of Tammuz always occur on the same day of week. In the Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 87, Rabbi Akiva is on record as having said that that the original Passover on which the Jewish people left Egypt also occurred on a Thursday. In light of this, the first set of Tablets had been given to Moses on a Thursday and New Year\u2019s day was on the Sabbath, which means that Yom Kippur was on a Monday. In other words the first set of Tablets was given on a Thursday and the second set on a Monday, so that both these days of the week share the same distinction. This may have been the reason why Ezra decreed that there be a public reading of the Torah on both of these days of the week. This may also have been hinted at in Isaiah 55,6 in the first two letters of the word \u05d1\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5, i.e. \u05d1\u05d4, these letters symbolising the second and fifth day of the week, respectively The prophet in that verse speaks about when it is especially appropriate to offer prayers, i.e. when G\u2019d is closer to us than usual. On these days the court is also in session. Rabbi B\u2019chor Shor sees in Leviticus 19,15: \u05d1\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e4\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05ea\u05da, \u201cbut in righteousness shall You judge your fellowmen,\u201d an allusion to the planet Jupiter, tzedek, which is prominent in both the mazzalot during the night from Sunday to Monday and during the first hour of Thursday according to an explanation in the Talmud tractate Shabbat, folio 119. [My almost total ignorance of astrology and how it dominates the fates of the gentile nations, cautions me not to go into greater detail about this. Suffice it to say that the fate of Jews is not dependent on such constellations at any time. Ed.]\n"}, "5": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u05de\u05d4 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da \u05e9\u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05de\u05da, \u201cand now, Israel, what is it the Lord your G\u2019d asks of you, etc.;\u201d the list that follows comprises all aspects of life, so that it is hard to understand Moses as portraying G\u2019d\u2019s demands upon us as something trivial. According to one view, this question refers only to the last item in the list, i.e. \u201cG\u2019d asks us to do only what is clearly of benefit for us and is good for us and the observance of which will result in our earning a great reward.\u201d However, our sages in the Talmud tractate B\u2019rachot, folio 33 are clearly disturbed by such an interpretation. This is why they distinguish between ordinary folks like ourselves, and Moses, and state that what appeared as relatively easy in Moses\u2019 eyes concerning himself, is a great deal more difficult for the ordinary Jew. Different sages dealing with the same problem arrive at a different conclusion by saying that the opportunity that G\u2019d gave us by our earning merits through the recital of 100 benedictions on each day is what makes it so easy to accumulate all those merits. They arrive at this by not understanding the word \u05de\u05d4 in our verse as meaning: \u201cwhat,\u201d but as \u05de\u05d0\u05d4, \u201cone hundred,\u201d the Torah alluding to how easy it is to accumulate one hundred merit points daily. (Compare Talmud, tractate Menachot, folio 43.) Our author tries to reinforce this daring interpretation by reminding us that whereas the numerical value of the word \u05de\u05d4 when we read the aleph bet from right to left, adds up to 45, when we read it from left to right these two letters appear as \u05d9\u05e5 in the matching (corresponding) sequence, and then add up to 100. Some, much later commentaries, such as Tur, Or Hachayim, chapter 46, state that King David, 500 years earlier than Ezra, who had introduced public Torah reading on Mondays and Thursdays, decreed the need to recite one hundred benedictions daily; he bases himself on Samuel II chapter 23,1 according to which 100 men in David\u2019s army died daily and he did not know why, so that he introduced the rule to recite these benedictions to ward off the cause for these mysterious deaths. The numerical value of the word \u05e2\u05dc which follows the word \u05d4\u05d5\u05e7\u05dd in that word is 100. and it is reported that the plague that killed one hundred people every day ceased forthwith, i.e. as soon as the people started reciting 100 benedictions daily. There is another interesting source for the benefit of the recital of 100 benedictions daily, which is derived from a verse in Psalms 128,4: \u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05db\u05d9 \u05db\u05df \u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05da \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8, \u201cso shall the man who fears the Lord be blessed,\u201d the last four words of this line, seeing that the word has been spelled defectively, i.e. \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05da, have a numerical value of 100, were the reason for the inclusion of the benediction \u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05da, \u201cwe give thanks to You,\u201d in the daily amidah prayer which we recite three times daily at least. We bow down while reciting this benediction. The source of bowing down when reciting these words is found in Samuel I 15,30 where King Sha-ul, after having been rebuked by the prophet Samuel for failing to have killed Agag, the King of the Amalekites, confesses to having sinned and bows down, \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da, \u201cI prostrated myself bowed down to the Lord your G\u2019d; .Targum Yonathan translates the word \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 there as meaning: \u201cI have given thanks.\u201d The fact is that we do not prostrate ourselves during the daily amidah prayer when reciting the prayer beginning with the word \u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd. The reason may be because the numerical value of the letters in that word is 100. This is another allusion to the fact that reciting 100 benedictions daily is appropriate or mandatory for each one of us.

If at the time of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish people were in a state of disgrace due to non observance, G\u2019d may supply only a little rainfall; this may spur them to engage in repentance. It will not make sense to suddenly increase the rainfall, as the decree had already been sealed and executed. If they had been in good standing at the beginning of the year, and G\u2019d therefore had provided the required amount of rain, but they subsequently became corrupted, how would G\u2019d be able to retract the rain that had already descended? Therefore, Rosh Hashanah is the time at which G\u2019d decrees the required amount of rainfall for the year at that time, but lets it descend on the part of the land that requires it if the conduct of the people deserves it, and on a different part of the land where it goes to waste, if the conduct of the people is such that it had forfeited this blessing.", "1": "\u05de\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4, \u201cfrom the beginning of the year.\u201d Why has the word \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea, spelled defectively, without the letter \u05d0 after the letter \u05e8?

The answer given is that when the Israelites all observe the Torah, they will have gentile servants to do the heavy work for them, When this is not the case, they will have to do it for themselves.

The other is strewn with thorns and thistle already immediately, but will become smooth later on. This is what the old man explains to anyone asking him which path to take. The old man, naturally advises a traveler to take the path that has thorns and thistles only initially. Some travelers, seeing that the man is old, do not take his advice, and pay for it dearly as it is most difficult to go back to the junction once one has become embroiled in the thorns and thistles, People who commit trespasses against the Torah in their youth, i.e. in this world, because they choose ease and comfort, will find it almost impossible to retrace their steps once they have become caught in thorns and thistles. People who accept the challenge of Torah laws in their youth, will find it progressively easier, and in the end, their path will ensure that they experience the coming of the Messiah in due course.

The reason they hired such labourers for a period of three years was that if they had hired such a person for a term of a year or two years, sometimes the years are longer and sometimes they are shorter, depending it had more than one month of Adar.

The word \u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05d4 occurs only once in connection with the festival of Sh\u2019vuot, and not at all in connection with the festival of Passover. Seeing that at Passover time no part of the harvest had been collected yet the time had not come to rejoice over the harvest. By the time of Sh\u2019vuot the barley and wheat harvest had been collected, so that there was partial rejoicing. Sukkot signaled the end of the harvesting season, so that at that time the farmer\u2019s heart was full of joy.

Yoav, son of Zeruiah was commander of the army;\u201d the paragraph lists additional civil servants and their respective assignments.\u201d The reason why these details are recorded there is to show that there were separate departments for the legal problems and for executing judgments once they had been formulated.\n", "2": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d8\u05e2 \u05dc\u05da \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4, \u201cdo not plant for yourself an asherah; (tree to serve as something to be worshipped.)

The entire testimony is declared as null and void because one of the witnesses was disqualified. The same applies if there were 100 witnesses and only one of them was disqualified. If however, two witnesses had come forward concerning a certain court-case, and some relatives of the accused wanted to join these two witnesses,-presumably in order to make the two witnesses useless,- this is not allowed as the relatives had never meant to accuse their kin in the first place of the sin he is accused of.

The word \u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 is not to be understood literally as the sacrifice, [which is either owned by an individual or is a communal offering. Ed.] The reason that must be so is that the portions of the animal assigned for the priest by the Torah, i.e. a foreleg, the stomach and the jaws, are not animals that have been sanctified as offerings, but are animals that were slaughtered privately, after offering sacrifices on private altars was no longer permitted, and they could be slaughtered only in the town where either the Tabernacle or the Temple stood.", "1": "\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1\u05d7\u05d9, the plural mode is used here in order to include animals owned by partners.\n"}, "2": {"0": "\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05d2\u05e0\u05da, \u201cthe first fruits of your corn harvest.\u201d No quantity has been mentioned as adequate for the amount of fruit to be given to the priest as this gift. It suffices that what is left over is recognisable as such. In other words, the farmer must not donate his entire corn harvest, or grape harvest to a priest or priests. This is why the sages in the tractate Chulin, folio 137, state that even a single husk of corn is considered as fulfillment of this commandment, although the sages on their own gave guidance when they said if one gives the priest one sixtieth of the harvest one is considered a miser, when one gives one fiftieth one is considered average, whereas when one gives one fortieth, one is considered generous. (Compare Mishnayot T\u2019rumot, chapter 4 mishnah 3.) The Mishnah there finds a hint in scripture for these measures. The prophet Ezekiel 45,13, writes: \u05e9\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cone sixtieth of an eyphah from a chomer of wheat.

There is also a hint in scripture that a generous measure is considered one fortieth of one\u2019s harvest when Ezekiel continues by writing: \u05d5\u05e9\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\u05dd \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05e4\u05d4 \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cyou are to take a sixth of an eypha from a chomer of barley. [The prophet refers to the t\u2019rumah, gift, to be given to the priest mentioned in Numbers 18,12, which had not been quantified by the Torah. Ed.] The word \u05e9\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\u05dd, is to be understood as \u201ctwo sixths.\u201d Our author refers us to Numbers 31,30 where the distribution of the loot from the Midianite campaign goes into further detail, from which one fiftieth is considered as average. In addition, the very word \u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d4, looked at closely, really means: \u201ctwo one hundreds.\u201d It could be read as \u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d0\u05d4, \u201ctwo one hundreds.\u201d", "1": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d2\u05d6 \u05e6\u05d0\u05e0\u05da \u05ea\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d5, \u201cand you are to give him (the priest) the first of the fleece of your sheep.\u201d The Talmud tractate Chulin folio 136, states that the minimum amount of such fleece is to be sufficient for the recipient to weave a belt for himself.\n"}}, "17": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05e8\u05da, \u201cyou shall divide your land into three sections.\u201d According to tradition, the total area of the Holy Land comprises 400 by 400 Parsah (1 parsah is equivalent to 4480 square meters.). According to the Talmud in tractate Makkot, folio 9, the word \u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea means that you are to divide this area into three parts 100 parsah from Hebron south 100 , 100 parsah from north from Hebron to Sh\u2019chem (Safed); 100 parsah from Sh\u2019chem to Kadesh. From there to the north 100 parsah. If this is correct, it would follow that the people dwelling between Hebron and Safed were much closer to the nearest city of refuge than people living in any other section of the land. The answer provided by Abbaye is that the region around Safed was known to harbour many killers. He based himself on Hoseah 6,9: \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8 \u05db\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d9\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7\u05d5 \u05e9\u05db\u05de\u05d4 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d6\u05de\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d5, \u201cthe gang of priest is like the ambuscade of bandits who murder on the road to Sh\u2019chem, for they have encouraged depravity.\u201d The expression \u201cgang of priests,\u201c sounds peculiar. What is meant by this? According to Rabbi Elazar this was a band of people who ganged up on priests who illegally raided storage barns of grain to help themselves to the portions meant for priests which the farmers had not distributed although the Torah bids them to do this. Seeing that their conduct was liable to result in at least unintentional killing, the cities of refuge were placed in their vicinity. In the region between kadesh and Hebron, murders also occurred frequently so that cities of refuge were placed there to allow those who had not killed deliberately to take refuge there. If you were to ask that if even on the west bank of Israel there were numerous instances of killings, why did Moses place half the cities of refuge there? We had stated originally that he did so because he felt that that area was more lawless than the \u201choly\u201d area west of the Jordan? We have to fall back on the explanation that the area around Gilead was even more plagued by violent people than the area west of the Jordan. The prophet Hoseah, in the verse before the one we quoted described Gilead as \u201cdrenched in blood.\u201d\n"}, "18": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd, \u201cyou shall first offer peace to that city. According to some sages the rule mentioned here even included nations who the Israelites had been ordered by G\u2019d to kill every \u201csoul.\u201d However, this command did not apply if the inhabitants agreed to vacate the town and relocate outside the Holy Land. We know that peace is superior to war, i.e. hostility, from when G\u2019d Himself changed what Sarah had thought about her husband when she considered him too old to impregnate her with effective sperm. (Genesis18,12) He did not tell him about that part of her reaction to the angel\u2019s prediction that by the following year she would have a son. We have a verse in Hoseah 4,17: \u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05e0\u05d7 \u05dc\u05d5, \u201cEphrayim is addicted to images,- let him be.\u201d This verse is quoted by Rashi in connection with the verse we just quoted from Genesis, where he says that this cannot be understood at face value, i.e. that the prophet should not predict doom for idol worshippers. Our author cites several additional examples of where we cannot take a quotation at face value, especially when the brothers after Yaakov\u2019s funeral quote their father as having commanded them to ask Joseph for forgiveness. (Genesis 50,17) The Torah wrote this in order to preserve harmony between Joseph and his brothers, not because Yaakov had actually said these words. Both the blessings by the priests end with bestowing the blessing of peace and the last of the 19 benedictions in the amidah prayer that we recite at least three times daily, concludes with the blessing of shalom, peace. Our sages in the Talmud, tractate Gittin folio 61, bid us to greet a gentile with the blessing of shalom before waiting for him to greet us, and in the event that he does to respond with using the expression shalom twice. Seeing that this might appear insincere on our part, the Talmud urges us to greet him before he can greet us so that we can avoid using the word shalom twice when greeting him, something that is forbidden in the Talmud, tractate Gittin folio 62. On folio 59 in the same tractate we are also told not to accept something that had been found by a deaf person or a minor, as it might have come into his possession illegally. We are also to feed the poor of the gentiles, all in order to maintain harmonious relations with the gentiles, generally. For all these reasons Hashem blessed His people with shalom (Psalms 29.11)\n", "1": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4, \u201cfor man is the tree of the field.\u201d The word: \u05db\u05d9 in this verse means the same as \u05d0\u05dc\u05d0, \u201cbut, only; meaning \u201csupposing a row of trees growing fruit appeared before your eyes while you were laying siege to a city, and these trees would provide cover for your enemies to hide behind them and plan to ambush you, how would you act if it were within your power to destroy these trees?

If his character does not match his Torah knowledge, we must not study Torah from him as he is not fit to be our model.

When our sages in the Talmud tractate Yevamot folio 120, stated that the only valid identification is recognising the carcasses\u2019 face, including his nose, this is meant when the identification is only based on facial features including the nose. When we can hear from the way the witnesses speak about the deceased that he must have been familiar to them, this testimony is definitely sufficient to allow the deceased\u2019s widow to remarry, even if this identification occurred several weeks after the slain person had been found. In fact, even identification from a distance may be sufficient. The example quoted in the Talmud there on folio 121, is that a Rabbi Yehudah ben Baba, performed a wedding ceremony for a woman five days after her husband had drowned and been identified. The Talmud justifies this due to decomposition of a corpse in water taking much longer that decomposition of features on dry land.\n", "1": "\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05e4\u05db\u05d4, \u201cour hands have not spilled this blood;\u201d it is peculiar that the last letter in the word \u05d5\u05e9\u05e4\u05db\u05d4 is the letter \u05d4 when we would have expected it to be the plural ending \u05d5. [It is read as if it had been spelled with the letter \u05d5. Ed.] Our sages drive from this spelling that there are five items=\u05d4, that must be provided by a host worthy of that name. They are: food, drink, overnight lodging, accompanying the guest at his departure for a certain distance, and providing him with some food for the journey. (Talmud Sotah, folio 45) The Talmud raises the question of how could anyone have thought that the members of the elders of the town near which the body had been found could have been responsible for the death of the person described in our paragraph? Why would they have to publicly declare their innocence? What these Elders really declared was that they had never been remiss in providing the five items mentioned in the Talmud to anyone who had been their guest. In other words, if that person had been a guest in their houses, they could state categorically, that he would have been treated in the manner that is appropriate. We have a saying by Rav Yehudah who quoted in the name of Rav, that anyone who has enjoyed as little as even four cubits of accompaniment from his host on his way out will not come to harm on the journey on which he set out. This saying has been illustrated by an actual occurrence. The scholar Ravinah accompanied Rava bar Yitzchok, when he became involved in a dangerous, potentially fatal situation, and he was saved from it (Talmud, Sotah folio 46) The Talmud sets the distances that a guest has to be accompanied by the host on his departure, commencing with a relatively short distance when a teacher had hosted a student, and a much greater distance when the student had hosted a teacher. (1200 meters in the latter case) Rabbi Meir considers the subject of such accompaniment one that the host can be enforced by a court to observe. [Naturally, the assumption is that the host is able-bodied. Ed.] According to Judges 1,24 there is no fixed limit for this, and the Israelites who had been in the process of conquering parts of the Holy Land that had not yet been conquered while Joshua had been alive showed a Canaanite gratitude for his showing them the way, similar to the spies promising Rahav of Jericho complete protection including her family for having protected them while on their mission. [The prophet explains how many parts of the land of Canaan remained unconquered on account of this for hundreds of years. Ed.] [If I understand correctly, when gentiles, even those under decree of death by the Torah unless they left the land, saved Israelites, our gratitude takes tangible form. In the example quoted from the Book of Judges, the Canaanite had not even personally accompanied the Israelites in question but had merely showed them the way. Ed.] In verse 26 of the incident quoted, the person whom they saved went forth to another part of the land of the Canaanites and successfully built a new city which he named Luz, [the name of Beyt El, before Yaakov had renamed it in Genesis 28,19. [Yaakov had been totally exposed there and had been saved miraculously. Ed.]. According to Rabbi Yoshua, Mitzrayim, (Pharaoh, in Genesis chapter 12,20, who gave Avraham a military escort to protect him, since he had become so wealthy) who accompanied Avraham for a distance of only 4 cubits beyond the border was rewarded, so that the Israelites had to wait four hundred years before being redeemed from Egypt. (Compare Talmud, tractate Sotah, folio 46) According to another view in the Talmud, when mention is made of \u05dc\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4, escorting someone, without any further detail, the distance meant is approx 1,2 km. This is also supposed to be the meaning of Psalms 91,11: \u05db\u05d9 \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05da \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05da \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9\u05da, \u201cfor He will order His angels to protect you wherever you go.\u201d The distance of 1,2 k.m. equal to the Hebrew word \u05de\u05d9\u05dc, is based on the first letters in the three words \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05da. When enjoying this level of escort one is certain to be successful in all one\u2019s undertakings. Nonetheless the sages said that giving a departing guest money without also giving him some bread, is not sufficient. They base themselves on Proverbs 28,21: \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05ea \u05dc\u05d7\u05dd \u05d9\u05e4\u05e9\u05e2 \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8, \u201csin sometimes originates from the lack of a piece of bread.\u201d Solomon means that having not ensured that a departing guest has access to some food immediately, may become the cause of his suffering from an attack of \u05d1\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05e1, \u201cravenous hunger,\u201d which if not dealt with immediately may result in the death of the afflicted person. Rabbi Yochanan went as far as to say that anyone who fails to escort a departing guest is guilty of bloodshed. He based himself on the fact that if the people of Jericho had escorted the prophet out of their city and provided him with basic necessities, he would not have caused the bears to kill 42 young people of that town. (Kings II 2,23) Rabbi Elazar in dealing with that incident, claims that the word \u05d5\u05e0\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd in that verse should not be understood as teenagers, but as \u05de\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd persons who abstain from performing G\u2019d\u2019s commandments, and the word \u05e7\u05d8\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd which follows, means as being \u201csmall\u201d in that they had little faith in G\u2019d. Elisha was supposed to have seen through prophetic insight that the mothers of all of these youngsters who had made fun of him had all become pregnant with them on Yom Kippur, on a day when having marital relations is strictly prohibited. This is why he felt free to curse them in the name of the Lord, as described there. Furthermore, the subject of escorting departing guests is of greater significance than handing out a gift. Handing out gifts is not something involving one\u2019s body, whereas escorting a departing guest involves a physical effort, showing that one is personally involved. In fact the performance of this commandment is of such significance that the benefits promised for the recipient are also applied to the host who performs this act, who will be protected until he comes home again. This is based on Isaiah 57,19: \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1, \u201cwelcome, welcome both to the one as yet distant and to the one already closer to us.\u201d The one described as \u201cdistant,\u201d is the departing guest, and the one described as \u201cnear\u201d is the host, who is on his way home. [Our author concludes with one or two additional blessings that is in store for people performing this commandment, which I have decided not to bother with. Ed.]", "2": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d1\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05dd \u05e0\u05e7\u05d9 \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05da, \u201cand you will remove the innocent blood from your midst.\u201d Rashi explains that in the event the murderer is found after the heifer had already been killed, the murderer is not going free. This sounds strange seeing that we learned in the Talmud, tractate Ketuvot folio 37, that the meaning of the word in our verse is that we use the wording in our verse to learn that administering the death penalty by the sword must be performed by severing the vital arteries of the neck, just as the neck of that heifer was broken by its fall. Rabbeinu Moshe offers a different interpretation of the wording in our verse: the paragraph cited by Rashi deals with a murderer who is sentenced to death and according to the opinion that the death penalty by strangulation is more severe (Compare Talmud tractate Sanhedrin folio 49) than the death penalty by having one\u2019s throat cut. This is also reasonable as the wording of the death penalty both in Exodus 21,12, and in Leviticus, 26,25: i.e. \u201che must surely be avenged,\u201d and \u201cI will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant;\u201d these lines refer to execution by the sword. The verse in Exodus quoted speaks of the penalty for killing a slave. If this is the penalty for killing a slave, it is logical that the penalty for killing a free man can certainly not be milder. This \u201clogic\u201d makes sense when we assume that the penalty by strangulation is milder than the penalty of cutting the victim\u2019s throat. How can that logic be applied according to the scholar who holds that the penalty of strangulation is harsher than having one\u2019s throat cut? Whence do we derive the law that murdering a free man is punishable by having one\u2019s throat cut? The answer given is that we derive it from a baraitha which compares the law applicable to our portion, i.e. the killing of the heifer as a symbolic action by which the people near the town where the slain person was found declare that they had not been remiss in sending that person out of their town without escort or without basic provisions. If the murderer is found after that procedure has already been performed, according to the opinion that strangulation is a milder penalty than having one\u2019s throat cut by comparing it to the penalty of the killer of a slave being executed by the sword, by reason of the logic we mentioned earlier. If one then would argue what is the meaning of the words in Numbers 35,33:\u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8, \u201cbut no expiation can be made for the earth\u201d (that absorbed the blood of the slain)? We would have to say that this applies for a case in which the murderer is found only after the Yom Kippur following his having committed the deed. If no atonement had been made by that time it cannot be atoned for retroactively anymore.", "3": "\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cand you take back some captives.\u201d According to Rashi, this includes Canaanites that were in that land or city; [in spite of the commandment not to allow any Canaanite to survive, as per Deut. 20,6. Ed.] If you were to wonder how this could be, remember that the Torah speaks of an expansionary war, outside the borders of what used to be the Canaanite land that was promised by G\u2019d to Avraham. If the prisoner had been captured outside those boundaries, the fact that she is now brought back to what used to be the land of Canaan does not make her subject to the commandment stated in Deut. 20,16.", "4": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05da, \u201dyou will bring her inside your house.\u201d According to the Talmud, tractate Kidushin folio 22, this means that after you had been intimate with her once, you must not do so again until after the procedures described in the verses that follow. Thus far the text in the Talmud as understood by Rashi. According to the version in the Jerusalem Talmud, however, even the first act of intimacy had been forbidden. The soldier cannot legally cohabit with her until all the details described in the Torah have been carried out. There are commentators who understand the words of Rashi, to not treat her harshly, to mean: \u201cdo not deprive her of the garments that she wore at the time of her capture.\u201d [It is assumed that she had worn her best clothes so as to find favour in the eyes of any potential captor so that he would not kill her. Ed.] This is hinted at by the sequence of the verses here where she has been described as being brought into her captor\u2019s house before undergoing a change of clothing in verse 13.\n", "5": "When a man has.

This is how Rashi explains it. If you were to ask that at least he should not have to face a harsher death penalty than that administered for armed robbery, which is death by the sword, not death by stoning, the Torah wrote that he ignored both father and mother, a euphemism for this son cursing father and mother, a crime which carries the penalty of death by stoning. (Compare Leviticus 20,9, where the wording of the Torah for cursing father or mother is: \u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d5, \u201chis blood will be upon him.\u201d Whenever this expression occurs it refers to death by stoning.", "8": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05e7\u05dc\u05dc\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05ea\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9, \u201cfor an impaled body is an affront to G\u2019d;\u201d a body that has not been buried is as if one had cursed G\u2019d, as anyone seeing that corpse will realise that the body while alive had cursed the Lord by his activities and tarnished the concept of man having been created in G\u2019d\u2019s image."}, "20": {"0": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05db\u05df \u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05da \u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05da, \u201cif you encounter by chance a bird\u2019s nest on your way, etc.;\u201d the reason why these paragraphs follow one another is that the performance of one commandment brings in its wake the performance of additional commandments. (Compare Devarim Rabbah, 6,4 on our portion). Seeing that the reward for the performance of the commandment just discussed results in your enjoying long life, you will have the opportunity to devote yourself for more years to Torah study. When you build a house for yourself, you will be able to perform the commandment of erecting a fence on the edges of its roof to protect anyone from falling off it. When the Torah follows with the warning not to mix seeds of different plants when planting a vineyard, you will enjoy harvesting the fruit of that vineyard. When you are warned not to harness an ox and a donkey to the same plough, [as it would result in the donkey suffering pain, seeing it is so much weaker. Ed.] you will enjoy owning many oxen and many donkeys as a result of observing that commandment. When the Torah subsequently warns you not to wear garments in which linen and wool have been woven in the same cloth [except when commanded to do so for the tzitzit in certain situations], you will be able to afford buying a beautiful tallit on which to perform the commandment to attach these fringes. (Compare Tanchuma, section 2). The commandment to own garments which qualify for the attaching of these fringes is extremely important as we know from the Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 32. According to a statement on that folio, anyone who is meticulous about the observance of that commandment will eventually be in command of 2800 servants. This statement is based on Zecharyah 8,23: \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d4\u05de\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d6\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05db\u05dc \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05d7\u05d6\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5 \u05d1\u05db\u05e0\u05e3 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05e0\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05e2\u05de\u05db\u05dd \u05db\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05de\u05db\u05dd, \u201cin those days ten men from nations of every tongue will take hold,-they will take hold of every Jew by a corner of his cloak and say: \u2018let us go with you, for we have heard that G\u2019d is with you.\u2019 [There are 70 tongues, multiplied by ten multiplied by four corners on each garment of a Jew adorned with tzitzit. Ed.] This is also the interpretation of Jeremiah 17,11-12: \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d2\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3, \u05e2\u05d5\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8, \u201clike a partridge announcing that it has hatched young when this is not true, or like amassing riches illegally;\u201d this is followed by the line: \u201c\u05db\u05e1\u05d0 \u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u201co throne of glory exalted from of old;\u201d how does this line connect with the line preceding it?\u201d it teaches that the partridge proclaiming to have hatched young from its eggs had stolen those eggs from another species of bird sitting on them only after they had already been hatched. Then they proceed to eat those chicks which belong to another category of bird. When the chicks try to fly and are unable to, they become victims to predators. Who caused this sequence? Whoever steals eggs that are not his own. The prophet uses this simile to describe the gentiles who boast about their ill gotten gains which are the result of robbery. These gentiles, who destroyed the Holy Temple by burning it, will eventually have to pay for their crime by becoming totally extinct.

G\u2019d did not want Jews to wear something symbolising that dividing curtain behind which was the Holy Ark from the lid of which the voice of G\u2019d could be heard. (by Moses) The same warning not to duplicate such sacred combinations was issued to the people in connection with the ingredients and quantities of the spices in the k\u2019toret, incense to be offered up twice daily. (Compare Exodus 30,38, and the Talmud in tractate Rosh Hashanah folio 24) People are also not to build annexes to their houses by duplicating measurements used for the Temple. An alternate reason offered for this prohibition of mixing wool and linen, is that Kayin\u2019s offering consisted of linen, and Hevel\u2019s of wool, and is therefore a reminder of jealousy and hatred, the opposite of what the Torah stands for.\n", "3": "\u05d5\u05de\u05ea\u05d5  \u05d2\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd, \u201cand they are both to die as a result.\u201d Rashi comments that the apparently extraneous word \u05d2\u05dd also, means that also the offspring of such a forbidden union is to die. He adds that if a man had cohabited with the woman in question after she had been condemned to die by the court that man is subject to the same penalty.

This is why the Torah in Deuteronomy 2,29 refers to this. Moav, though their founding father Lot had been the recipient of acts of kindness by Avraham his uncle, had denied any assistance to the Jewish people at that time. (Judges 11,17).

King Uzziyahu was afflicted by it, as we know from Chronicles II 26,21. Being afflicted by this disease is most shameful for the person concerned, so that even if he is a king he must remain in isolation and cannot function in his palace and must be obedient to what the priest tells him concerning the length of time of this disease. This is also the reason why the Torah adds that we must remember how Moses\u2019 sister Miriam was afflicted by this disease because she had been guilty of badmouthing her brother Moses.

These firstling fruit are given only to Jewish priests, and only from land defined as \u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05da, \u201cyour (ancestral) land?\u201d This word specifically excludes produce not grown by Jews on Jewish land. Rabbi Yom Tov explained it to him and showed him a Midrash in which it is stated specifically that converts (referred to as \u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, onetime strangers, may bring bikkurim, but they may not recite the benediction in which we give thanks for the land which the Lord had sworn to our forefathers to give to Avraham\u2019s descendants (Compare Mishnah 4,chapter 1 tractate Bikkurim. Since the Lord had not sworn to give this land to converts, he could obviously not give thanks for what had never been promised or given to him or his forefathers. Nonetheless, when he says his prayers, privately, he may refer to \u201cour G\u2019d, the G\u2019d of the forefathers of Israel.\u201d if his mother had been Jewish, he will use the same formula every Jew uses, i.e. \u201cour G\u2019d and G\u2019d of our forefathers. In the Jerusalem Talmud Rabbi Yehudah states that the proselyte, though, of course, the land had not been given to his forefathers, may address G\u2019d as also the G\u2019d of our forefathers, as G\u2019d has proclaimed Himself to be the \u201cfather\u201d of all converts According to Rabbi Yehudah, the convert recites the same benediction as the natural born Jew when bringing bikkurim. This is based on G\u2019d having appointed Avraham as the \u201dfather\u201d of a multitude of nations in Genesis 17,5.

In response to that act, the Creator traded all the other 70 nations on earth as His potential favourite, and chose us instead. This would be similar to what Moses said in Psalms 94,4 \u05d9\u05ea\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05e4\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05df, \u201cfor how long will the ones mouthing falsehoods (against Israel) be allowed to get away with it?\u201d Still another interpretation of these unusual verses: The word \u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e8 occurs in Isaiah 17,6, \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d2\u05e8\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e8, \u201ctwo or three berries on the topmost branch;\u201d here we would have to understand the word \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05ea as meaning that Israel had elevated the Lord G\u2019d to the topmost branch, and the Lord responded by elevating the Jewish people to the highest ranking nation.

The answer given here that the \u201cman\u201d mentioned here is a man who had incestuous relations which resulted in a son being born for him, who then left the fold and served the idols of whichever religion he adopted. The Torah curses the father and mother of such a son who are directly responsible for their son having left the fold as a result of their committing incest. Rashi explains that we face a list of eleven sins the punishment for which is introduced with the word: \u201ccursed be;\u201d they correspond to the eleven sons of Yaakov who had received his blessing. Shimon had not received such a blessing, and it was not Moses\u2019 intention to bless that tribe in the manner in which he blessed all the other tribes. [Our editions of Rashi do not have this commentary on this verse, so I will not dwell on it further. Ed.] If you were to ask what makes the eleven sins subject to a curse for the sinner different from violating any of the other of G\u2019d\u2019s commandments, one answer may be that all these commandments when violated are known only to the sinner and the Creator. No human being can take the sinner to court for something he had not witnessed and warned the offender not to commit. [some of the eleven, of course, were committed by consent with one\u2019s partner in sin, so that they too could not be brought to court. Ed.] According to a statement in the midrash \u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1, the person subject to these curses is the one who had studied the laws in question, had taught them observed them personally, and had been in a position to protest these sins from being committed, but had failed to make use of his ability to prevent these sins from being committed. This is why at the end of the paragraph, the Torah concludes with cursing people who had been in a position to see to it that others keep the ordinances of the Torah, and had failed to make his weight felt. On the other hand, if someone had not learned the laws, had not taught them, had not observed them, say because he had sat in jail and could not do this, but had seized an opportunity to protest other people violating Torah laws, and had done so, he is included in all the people that Moses describes as being blessed for \u201ckeeping the Torah laws,\u201d as he had demonstrated that only his physical inability to perform many of them had stopped him from doing so."}, "26": {"0": {"0": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8, \u201cYou will be blessed in the town;\u201d you will be blessed for performing the commandments that are performed in an urban area, such as building a sukkah, attaching a mezzuzah to the doorposts of your houses, or a fence around the roof of your house.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4, \u201cand you will be blessed in the field;\u201d this applies to the farmers who observe the manifold laws pertaining to growing crops and leaving some of the harvest for the poor or the priests and Levites.

If you multiply 430 by three the result is 1290. According to Daniel, at that time exile will end.

The prophet Ezekiel has spelled this out clearly in Ezekiel 20, 32-37: \u201cthat which entered your thoughts- it shall not be!

In fact, the retribution for openly committed sins and tolerated by the courts, will result in the punishment extending beyond a single generation as long as we do not wipe out the phenomenon of open rebellion against the covenant that the whole people had voluntarily entered into with Hashem. The Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin, folio 43 points out that the dots above the letters \u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 and above the letter \u05e2 of the word \u05e2\u05d3, are to inform us that as long as the Israelites had not crossed the river Jordan and been on sacred ground, G\u2019d had not punished anyone for sins committed in private, not witnessed by even family members. The reason for this was that only after crossing the Jordan did the Jews accept the Torah [most of whose commandments did not apply outside the Holy land. Ed.] individually and collectively, so that each Israelite became responsible also for the sins committed by his fellow Jew. At that point what is written the words \u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cfor us and our children,\u201d became applicable. If you were to query that if the above were correct, why is the last dot on the word \u05e2\u05dc instead of on \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, perhaps the reason is that it would be inappropriate to do this when it is subject to being erased. The words: lashem elokeynu in Hebrew including the tetragram that I cannot spell out here, comprise eleven letters, and that is why our sages place 11 dots to hint to us that this is where the dots really should have been. [Since no Israelite who had not yet crossed the river Jordan ever saw a Torah scroll with these eleven dots, I find the interpretation offered quite irrelevant. Ed.] According to a text known as massoret hag\u2019dolah, the dots are attributed to when Ezra had to rewrite the Torah after the redemption when different scrolls had variations in the text, and the time would come when Moses would challenge him why he had not done it differently, he would explain that because of his doubts he had placed the dots on top. If Moses would be satisfied with the way Ezra had done it, it would be easy to erase the dots without harming the text of the Torah scroll. From this it is clear that Ezra had his doubts about G\u2019d not holding us responsible for not interfering when becoming aware of sins committed prior to crossing the Jordan.\n"}, "28": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da, \u201cand (then) you will return to the Lord your G\u2019d;\u201d elsewhere (Deut.23,15) it says in indirect speech: \u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da \u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea\u05da \u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05de\u05da, \u201cand the Lord your G\u2019d will return with your captives and have mercy on you. Why does this have to be repeated? In the Talmud, tractate \u201cYuma\u201d, folio 86, the Talmud says that repentance is important as it hastens the arrival of the redemption. This is based on Isaiah 59,20: \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05dc\u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d2\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc, \u201dand the Redeemer will come to Zion,\u201d why?

By the time he transgresses a fourth time he is no longer subject to forgiveness. He bases himself on Amos 2,6: \u201cthus said the Lord; for three transgressions of Israel, for four I will not revoke it (evil decree);\u201d this is how the Talmud in tractate Yuma folio 86 understands that verse. I heard a reason for this attributed to Rabi Meir Levi, who stated that access to the Lord is guarded by three different \u201cfences.\u201d The first is overwhelming noise, the second is fire, and the third is a region of strong wind; finally there is a region in which almost inaudible sound is heard; (Compare Kings I 19, 11-12) in each region of these fences there are angels. When a person sins for the first time, the angels in the first region obstruct such a person\u2019s access to commit further sins. This results in his obtaining forgiveness [as without this he would continue to sin having started to do so. Ed.] This process continues in varying degrees if he commits a second or third sin [without having repented in the interval. Ed.] When he sins a fourth time, having already breached the fences separating him from the Presence of G\u2019d three times, he is no longer subject to forgiveness, as we know from Isaiah 65,3-7: \u201cthe people who provoke My anger who continually, to My very face, sacrifice in gardens and burn incense on tiles etc. etc.   such things make My anger rage, like fire blazing all day long and I will not stand idly by but will repay deliver their sins into their bosom and the sins of their fathers as well.\u201d In other words, G\u2019d is patient until sinning has become a pattern of the sinner\u2019s lifestyle before He reacts irrevocably.\n", "1": "\u05de\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d4, \u201cwho will ascend to heaven on our behalf?\u201d the respective first letters in these four words, when read separately and consecutively spell \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4, circumcision.

He felt that he was not being dealt with fairly. G\u2019d explained to him that he erred and that what He had decreed was for his own good. How so?

Moses, i.e. his name, has no partners, as the Torah testifies that no other human being emerged who could match Moses.

He read out of each one before each of the tribes passages of warning, exhorting them to observe the Torah meticulously. He read to the men and women separately, warning them to treasure their Torah scroll and protect it from all hazards. Moses took the thirteenth Torah scroll and deposited it in the Holy Ark next to the second set of Tablets. This interpretation is based on the text of this verse, which appears portray him as instructing the priests to do so, [as being \u201conly\u201d a Levite he had no access to the Holy Ark inside the tabernacle. Ed.] Other commentators suggest that the archangel Gavriel descended from the heavenly regions and took the thirteenth Torah scroll back with him to those regions. The reason for this was to acquaint the residents of those regions with the greatness of Moses. This exegesis is based on Deuteronomy 33,21: \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05ea \u05d4' \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201cHe executed the righteousness of the Lord and His ordinances with Israel.\u201d Not only this, but the righteous in those regions read from this Torah scroll every Monday and Thursday, every Sabbath and on every New Moon and the festivals.

The reason is that Moses\u2019 primary field of activity was with heaven, he was close to it and did not need to worry about the ability of the heavens to hear him, but needed their attention to his words. Isaiah being closer to earth than to heaven had to proceed in the reverse order, first making sure that witnesses\u2019 ears were open, before worrying about gaining their undivided attention. When someone is close to the one who addresses him, all he needs to do to get the message is turn his ears in the source of the sound\u2019s direction. A person who is far from the speaker needs to insure first that he is heard, before worrying that what he says will be heard and understood. According to Rashi, (in his commentary on Isaiah) the reason for the opposite approaches taken between Moses and Isaiah is that both heaven and earth are witnesses, (compare Deut. 30,19) seeing they will be around as long as any Israelites exist, they had to be addressed as such in similar terms, i.e. both as hearing and hearkening, (paying attention to what they hear) otherwise each could claim that they were only witnesses to part of what had been demanded of them. Rav Hunna, quoting Rav Acha, claims that from the wording it is clear that there are more witnesses in heaven than on earth, seeing that Moses addresses heaven in the plural mode, \u05d4\u05d0\u05d6\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, whereas he addresses earth in the singular mode, \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05de\u05e2.

They will bear the shame of the deeds of their fathers. This is also the meaning of the Targum on this verse.

Seeing that slaves cannot own anything in their own right, they are never more than tenants on that land.- Genesis 10,15-18 lists the genealogy of Canaan, eleven in number, that are relevant in that respect.

Concerning this subject we read in the Talmud, tractate Kidushin, folio 38, that as soon as they offered the first omer offering, (a measure of the new barley harvest) they were permitted to eat from the produce of the land. This statement in the Talmud was challenged by Rabbi Nathan Ophniel, who asked why they had to wait until they had offered that offering, seeing that the positive commandment of eating matzot on the first night of the Passover festival (Exodus 12,18) should override the negative commandment (Leviticus 23,14) of not eating from the new barley harvest, just as the positive commandment of circumcising oneself on the eighth day (overrides the negative commandment of not tampering with the foreskin of the newly born if it had displayed signs of the skin affliction known as tzoraat. The answer to his objection is that the sages decreed the prohibition on account of the second piece of matzah, i.e. once the amount of an olive\u2019s size of matzah had been eaten, the commandment in Exodus is no longer mandatory, and it would be too easy to transgress the commandment of not eating from the new barley harvest prior to offering the omer. We find a similar situation with the widow of brother a of the High Priest who had died without child, and who would be in line for the levirate marriage to her brother-in-law the High Priest. (Compare Talmud tractate Yevamot folio 20) You could argue that the positive commandment of performing such a rite (Deuteronomy 25,5) should override the negative commandment that a High Priest must not marry a widow. (Leviticus 21,14) There too the sages forbade the levirate marriage as after the first marital union the High Priest would have fulfilled the whole commandment, and if he were to sleep with his wife by levirate marriage a second time, he would have committed a very serious sin. The sages therefore forbade such a levirate marriage in order to make sure that the High Priest would not become guilty of such a sin.", "2": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05e7\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e9 \u05de\u05e1\u05dc\u05e2, \u201cand He made him suck honey from a crag in the rock.\u201d The honey mentioned here is bee\u2019s honey.

A man had married an extremely attractive looking wife. After a while he took a second wife who was ugly in the extreme. His first wife became extremely angry at her husband, saying to him that she could have understood it if he had married another attractive woman who would have been competition to her. The fact that he married an ugly woman, she felt was a deliberate insult, suggesting that she was just as ugly as the second wife he had taken. (Compare Talmud, tractate Avodah zarah, folio 55.) Moses is telling the people that although G\u2019d would be angry at them for worshipping the sun, which appears powerful and a source of life to them, instead of worshipping Him Who had created the sun; but to worship something that is totally useless to them was an additional insult which He resents accordingly with great anger.", "2": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5\u05dd, \u201ca deity they had never heard of.\u201d They had heard of it, but had never heard that it possessed any power.

Our sages in the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 7 state that the bones of Yehudah were rattling in their coffin all the years that the Israelites wandered in the desert, the reason being that he had said to his father Yaakov before obtaining permission to take Binyamin to Egypt, that he would consider himself as having sinned unforgivably against him for all his life if he did not bring him back safe and sound. (Genesis 43,9). Even though it appears at first glance as if Binyamin had descended with the rest of Yaakov\u2019s family (Genesis 46,21) when a wise man utters a curse, even a conditional one, it comes true at some time [Yaakov had cursed the anonymous person who had stolen Lavan\u2019s t\u2019raphim if he would be found, and although he never found that person Rachel died prematurely on account of that as she had stolen them. Ed.] (compare Talmud, tractate Makkot, folio 11) The Talmud there describes that at the time when David dug the hole known as shitin, under the site where the Temple would stand in the future, the subterranean waters started rising from the depths and threatened to flood the earth. At that point, when Achitofel did not rule on the subject though he had been openly invited to do so, David reasoned as follows before writing the holy name of G\u2019d on a shard commanding the waters to stop rising. If in the case of a woman suspected of infidelity by her husband, the priest dissolves a parchment with the Holy Name of the Lord in order to help restore marital harmony, when the life of the whole of humanity is at stake, surely I am not only allowed but I have the duty to try and save mankind by that means. (Compare Numbers 5, 11-31) When Achitophel saw that his advice concerning the rebellion of Avshalom had not been followed, he went home and arranged his affairs, and hung himself. (see beginning of chapter 17). [Achitofel, according to tradition was the outstanding Torah scholar of his generation, and at one time David\u2019s tutor. Ed.] The Talmud Makkot quoted before comes to the conclusion that Moses when wondering why the bones of Reuven did not rattle in their coffin whereas those of Yehudah, his brother did not, especially since it had been Yehudah\u2019s public confession of having fathered Tamar\u2019s children which had caused Reuven to also publicly confess that he had committed an indiscretion with Bilhah, and remains with a question, else he would not have commenced Yehudah\u2019s blessing with the words he did. He did not bless Shimon, just as his father had also not given him a blessing on his deathbed, as in addition to the deceit and violence at Sh\u2019chem, as the leader of that tribe, Zimri had added to his sin by sleeping provocatively with a Midianite princess, as reported in Numbers 25,6. Although Levi had been Shimon\u2019s partner in the killing of the male population of Sh\u2019chem, his descendants had rehabilitated themselves when, to a man, none of them participated in worshipping the golden calf.

Thereupon Moses said to G\u2019d: \u201cI have one request to make from You so that they can all see that there is absolutely no one like You;\u201d before he could articulate his request all the gates of the earth and the great deep opened up, and this is what Moses meant when he had said to the people in Deuteronomy 4,39: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05d1\u05d1\u05da \u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u201cyou will know this day and it will register in your hearts, that the Lord is the G\u2019d;\u201d as soon as he had gotten to this word, Moses added: \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3, \u201cno one else.\u201d As soon as G\u2019d had heard Moses saying these words, He said to him: \u201csince you have said the words: \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3,\u201cI will testify with the same words that there never has been nor ever will be again a prophet comparable to your stature.\u201d (verse 10 in our chapter). Immediately following this conversation, G\u2019d, personally, accompanied by the three angels Michael, Gavriel and Zagzagel (the angel who teaches fetuses in their mother\u2019s wombs the Torah) descended to earth, Gavriel prepared the bier on which Moses was to die, Michael spread a red woolen sheet over it, whereas Zagzagel arranged his headrest on the bier. G\u2019d instructed Moses how to arrange the various parts of his body when he laid down on the bier, and as soon as he had done so, He spoke to the soul of Moses, reminding it that it had been granted the privilege of being a guest in Moses\u2019 body for one hundred and twenty years, but saying that the time had now come for it to return to its place in the celestial regions. The soul replied in a very respectful manner to G\u2019d that although it was aware that G\u2019d had created it in order to reside within Moses\u2019 body, the fact that during all these one hundred and twenty years she had enjoyed being hosted by the purest body a body that had never been host to any worm or otherwise destructive creature. Even flies had never settled on Moses\u2019 skin. The body she inhabited had never been jealous or envious of a fellow human being. Seeing that she had been privileged to inhabit such a body, the soul said, she was very reluctant to leave such a body. After having listened to the soul, G\u2019d again asked her not to delay His timetable. He promised that soul to promote it to the loftiest rank of all the creatures in the celestial spheres. Its permanent seat would be immediately below His throne, next to the highest ranking groups of angels. Still, the soul responded that it would prefer to remain in Moses\u2019 body to sharing such honours with the highest ranking angels. It pointed out that from those groups of angels several when becoming residents on earth, i.e. Uzza and Azael, had become more corrupt and had lusted after human females until G\u2019d had been forced to put an end to them. Moses, on the other hand, when G\u2019d had appeared to him at the burning bush, never once continued to have sexual relations with his wife. As a result, she, this soul, begged to remain part of Moses. In view of all this, G\u2019d decided to remove Moses\u2019 soul from his body by kissing it. This is the meaning of the word: \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9 \u05d4', \u201cby the mouth of the Lord\u201d, at the end of our verse. At that hour, G\u2019d Himself broke out weeping, seeing that He had been forced to remove Moses from earth through a decree issued by oath a long time ago; this is alluded to in Psalms 94,16: \u05de\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dd-\u05de\u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d9 \u05d9\u05ea\u05d9\u05e6\u05d1 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e4\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05df, G\u2019d mourned the fact that from now on \u201cwho will take My part against evil men, who will stand up for Me against wrongdoers?\u201d The angels in heaven were also weeping and saying: \u05d5\u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4 \u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05de\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9, \u201cbut where can wisdom now be found, and where is now the source of understanding?\u201d The heavens were weeping and saying: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d3 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cthe pious have vanished from earth.\u201d (Michah 7,2). The author continues in this vein, quoting all parts of creation bemoaning the death of Moses as an irreplaceable loss for mankind. (The sources of the above statements are found in Devarim Rabbah at the end, and in Yalkut Shimoni on the portion of Vayelech) Concerning the last eight verses in the Torah, their author, and how to relate to this as it is difficult to attribute them as having been written by Moses either posthumously or before his death, the Talmud tractate Baba batra folio 15, suggests as a possible way to deal with this problem, that they be read by individuals but not as part of the public Torah reading. This line in the Talmud is interpreted differently by a number of commentators. Seeing that we read these lines in the normal fashion, there is no point in challenging what has been accepted for many hundreds of years by all sections of orthodox Judaism.\n"}}}
