And if it had some signs of its mother it is a firstborn and it is permanently blemished for there is no blemish greater than change of its species. Even a cow that gave birth to offspring similar to a donkey, and it has some signs of a cow, it as a firstborn for the priest because the laws of firstborn apply to donkeys. But if it gave birth to [offspring similar to] a horse or a camel, even if it has some signs of a cow, it is a doubtful firstborn and therefore may be eaten by the owners. And if the priest seized it, we don't take it from him [the priest]."}}}
