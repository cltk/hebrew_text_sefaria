And it seems to me that the text wanted to warn all those bringing an offering to God not to stumble in the two ways that Cain and Abel stumbled, who were the first people to offer an offering.  For Cain stumbled in that he brought from the lesser and tawdry crops though he planted grain.  Those who err mortally needed to bring the life of an animal in exchange for their life.  And for [cases of] distress, the Holy One Blessed be He allowed for a poor person to bring a grain offering lacking life and offer it as if that person was offering an animal, as Rashi explains on the verse, \u201cShould a person bring forward a grain offering\u201d (Leviticus 2:1). Abel, even though he brought an offering from the choicest of his sheep, nevertheless, he did not do well either for the offering did not emerge from himself and he did not move quickly to do this commandment on his own accord.  Only after he saw Cain offer an offering did he become jealous of him and Abel from an offering as well to match him."}, "1": {}, "2": ["God said to Moses on Mt.

For this has a similarity and connection with Mt. Sinai from the side of there being an air that makes people wise (B. Baba Batra 158b). And the Torah [in general] is not like the Torah of the land of Israel and Mt. Sinai. Therefore it was appropriate to give also to that land the holiness of Mount Sinai after the number 49 years, and thus with the number 7.", "\tOr in order to make a memorial of the standing at Sinai through the calling of liberty and the blowing of the shofar. This joins to all the other reasons that there is to this mitzvah.", "\tTherefore it was said on Mount Sinai, and this is the correct meaning."]}}
