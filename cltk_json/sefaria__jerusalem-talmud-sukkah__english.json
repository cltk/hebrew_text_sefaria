And the Sages say: the matter does not have a dictated amount, except on the first nights of the festival [when there is an obligation to have a meal]. And Rabbi Eliezer also said: One who did not eat [a meal in the sukkah] on the first night of the festival can compensate [for his obligation by having a meal] on the last night of the festival. And the Sages say: in such a matter there is no compensating; regarding this it was said: (Ecclesiastes 1:15) \"That which is defective cannot be amended, and the deficiency cannot be counted.\"", "1": "What is Rabbi Eliezer's reason? It is said here \"sit\". And it says later (Leviticus 8:35): \"And you shall sit at the door of the tent of meeting day and night.\" Just as sitting later [the tent] the nights are like the days, so too here the nights are like the days. Rabbi Yohanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: It is written (Leviticus 23:6) \"the fifteenth\" in Pesach, and it is written (Leviticus 23:34) \"the fifteenth\" in Sukkot. Just as \"the fifteenth\" in Pesach means that the first night is obligatory [to eat matza], and afterwards is optional; so too here \"the fifteenth\" means that the first night is obligatory [to eat in the Sukkah], and afterwards is optional."}}}
