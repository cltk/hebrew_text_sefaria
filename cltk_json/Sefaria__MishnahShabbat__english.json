(If he had) one to circumcise on Sabbath eve, and the other on Shabbath, and he circumcised the first on Shabbath, R. Eliezer rules that he is liable for a sin-offering, and R. Yehoshua exempts him.

For he erred in the performance of a mitzvah and did not perform a mitzvah when he circumcised the after-Shabbath child on Shabbath. In this, even R. Yehoshua concurs. (\"one to circumcise on Shabbath, and one to circumcise on Sabbath eve, and he forgot and circumcised the Sabbath eve child on Shabbath, R. Eliezer rules that he is liable for a sin-offering\":) For milah beyond its time does not override Shabbath.

Therefore, he has to wait until after Shabbath, until the tenth day.] If yom tov (a festival) fell out after Shabbath, [milah out of its time does not override it, so that] he is circumcised on the eleventh day.

Yossi permits puncturing it only from the top, at the head of the stopper, it not being customary to fashion an opening there, but rather to remove the entire stopper. But, on the side, sometimes one does puncture the side of the stopper to make an opening (not wanting to open it on top so that pebbles or sand not fall into the wine.)] And if it were punctured, he is not permitted to place wax upon it, this being memareach (\"smearing\") [forbidden by reason of memachek (\"erasing\")].

And only if he not intend a large portion against a small portion.\" It is only then that it is forbidden on a festival and permitted on a weekday. But if he intends a large portion against a small portion, it is forbidden even on a weekday, because of gambling. For this is akin to theft, and asmachta (\"reliance\") does not effect acquisition. This instance is one of asmachta, for he \"relies\" on the lot's falling on the large portion, for which reason he acquiesces in the possibility of its falling on the small portion, too. But if he knew ab initio that this would occur, he would not acquiesce.] And it is permitted to cast lots (chalashim) on a festival [upon offerings that were slaughtered on the festival, for distribution among the Cohanim.

[Abba Shaul here differs with the first tanna, who forbids all waiting for dark, making no distinction between doing so for a mitzvah or for a mundane activity. He comes to tell us that waiting for dark for a mitzvah is permitted. For just as it is permitted to tell one's fellow on Shabbath: \"Be ready (after Shabbath) to go to bring a casket and burial shrouds for one who has died,\" so is it permitted to wait for dark at the tchum in order to do so after dark.

[But if there is a gentile with him, he gives it to the gentile. Why so? For one is commanded vis-\u00e0-vis the resting of an ass, but not vis-\u00e0-vis the resting of a gentile.

They, therefore, stopped up the window facing the house of the tumah with a tafiach with its back to the path (an earthenware vessel not acquiring tumah from the back and thus serving as a partition against tumah). For they feared that the cleft in the gigith might be less than a handbreadth, in which instance the gigith would \"tent\" the path and the uncleanliness would come by way of the path from one house to the other. Afterwards, they had to open the window and take out the stopper, and they wanted to determine whether the cleft in the gigith were a handbreadth (or more) \u2014 in which instance there would not be a tent in that path for the conducting of the tumah, for the tumah would leave the path upwards by way of the cleft in the gigith \u2014 or whether it were less than a handbreadth, in which instance the path would act as a \"tent\" and conduct the tumah from house to house. They, therefore, measured a mekeidah, tied it with gemi, and extended it to the top (of the gigith) to see whether or not the cleft were a handbreadth.] And from what they prescribed we learned that we stop up, and measure, and tie on Shabbath [so long as it not be a permanent knot and the measurement be for mitzvah or to the end of a halachic ruling.]"}, "3": {"0": "With what may one insulate and with what may one not insulate?

Four on the four sides of the bed, and one in the middle? From (Isaiah 61:11): \"For as the earth brings forth her growth, and as a garden sprouts its seeds.\" It is not written \"its seed,\" but \"its seeds.\" [(\"five (different varieties of) seeds\":) so that there be enough separation between them that they not constitute a (forbidden) admixture (kilayim). (\"Four on the four sides of the bed\":) He fills every side close to the corner, and in the middle he sows only one kernel, so that it is three cubits distant from what is sown on every side. For the \"nurturing\" distance between one seed and another is a cubit and a half. And even though near the corners in each direction the seeds are close to each other, not being three cubits removed, and being nourished by one another, there is no reason for apprehension here, for it was kilayim (the forbidden admixture) itself that Scripture was concerned with, and not with the nourishment factor. As it was taught: If there were a fence between them, one can sow next to the fence on one side; and the other, next to the fence on the other, even though they are mutually nourished from beneath. And here (in our instance) there is a clear separation; for one side is sown north-south and the other, east-west. But between the middle seed to those at the sides, there is no clear separation, and if they were close, they would constitute an admixture, for which reason they require distancing to the extent of nourishing. (\"For as the earth brings forth her growth, and as a garden sprouts its seeds\":) \"brings forth\" \u2014 one; \"her growth\" \u2014 one; \"its seeds\" \u2014 two; \"sprouts\" \u2014 one; all together \u2014 five. (That it be in an area of six cubits by) six cubits is not derived from the verse; but the rabbis know that with five varieties of seed in such an area, the corners are not nourished by the middle nor the middle by the corners, the nourishment distance of each seed being a cubit and a half. So that when Scripture intimates five seeds, it is understood to be in an area of six by six cubits. And in Tractate Kilyaim I have explained the halachoth of garden beds in detail.

[He did not perform akirah in the private domain and hanachah in the public domain, a \"place of liability,\" which would make his labor a complete one \u2014 but he performed akirah in a \"place of liability,\" and hanachah in a karmelith, for which hanachah he is not liable, and then he performed akirah in the karmelith, which is not a \"place of liability,\" and hanachah in the public domain, so that akirah from a place of liability and hanachah in a place of liability was not performed at one time (i.e., in the same act).] If he placed a basket on the outer doorstep [facing the public domain], even if most of the fruits are outside (i.e., in the public domain), he is not liable until he takes out [i.e., until he takes out in the beginning] the entire basket. And this is so only if the basket is full of cucumbers and gourds, which are long, so that some of them are still inside; but if it were full of mustard plants, where many of them are entirely outside, it is considered as if he took out the entire basket and he is liable.]", "2": "\tIf one takes out (something on Shabbath), whether in his right hand or his left hand, in his bosom, or on his shoulder, he is liable, for this was the (manner of) carrying of the sons of Kehath [viz. (Numbers 7:9): \"On the shoulder they bore.\" And right hand, left hand, or bosom are customary ways of carrying.] (If he takes something out) on top of his hand, on his foot, in his mouth, in his elbow, in his ear, in his hair, or in his pundah [a hollow belt] with its mouth downwards [This is not the normal way of carrying; but mouth upwards is. Another interpretation: \"afundatho,\" a garment worn close to the skin to absorb sweat. They would make pockets in it, and when it was turned upside down, the mouth of the pocket faced downwards.], between his pundah and his garment, in the [bottom] edge of his garment, in his shoe, or in his sandal, he is not liable, for this is not the customary way of carrying.", "3": "\tIf one intended carrying out (an object) in front of him, and it ended up in back of him, he is not liable, [for he intended greater protection (of the object) and ended up with lesser protection.] (If he intended carrying it out) in back of him, and it ended up in front of him, he is liable. [For he intended (even) lesser protection and ended up with greater protection.] In truth it was said: A woman who wears a sinar [a small garment worn for modesty] is liable. [If she hangs something on it to take out, and it ends up on the other side, she is liable], for it is customary for it to do so, [and she knew this in the beginning.] The same applies to the receivers of missives [of the king. The couriers who carry them place them in hollow reed-like wooden containers, which they place on their necks and which, as they are aware, are wont to turn back and forth. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]", "4": "\tIf one takes a loaf out to the public domain, he is liable. If two took it out, they are not liable. [This is derived from (Leviticus 4:27): \"in doing it, one of the mitzvoth of the L rd which may not be done\" \u2014 one who does all of it, and not one who does part of it.] If one could not take it out, and two took it out, they are liable. R. Shimon exempts them, [holding that even if one could not do it, if two did it, they are not liable. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] If one takes out food less than the (stipulated) quantity in a vessel, he is not liable even for the vessel, for the vessel is \"subservient\" to the food. (If one takes out) a living person in a bed, he is not liable even for the bed, for the bed is subservient to the person. [He is not liable for taking out the living person if he is not bound, for a living person \"carries\" himself. And this is so only with a human being, but not with beast, animal, or bird, for they are regarded as \"bound.\"] Likewise, (if one took out) an olive-size of a dead body, an olive-size of carrion, or a lentil-size of sheretz, he is liable. [For since an olive-size of a dead body causes uncleanliness, taking it out is an act of importance, viz., to rescue oneself from uncleanliness. The same applies to an olive-size of carrion and a lentil-size of sheretz, this being their stipulated quantity for uncleanliness.] R. Shimon exempts (from liability) [even carrying out a dead body, this being \"a labor which is not needed for itself,\" any act whose purpose is only to remove something, being subsumed in this formulation in that it is not a labor of \"design.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]", "5": "\tIf one removes his nails, one (hand removing) from the other, or with his teeth; likewise, his moustache; likewise, his beard. Similarly, if one plaits (godeleth) [her hair. The targum of (Exodus 28:14): \"avothoth\" (\"wreathed\") is \"gedilatha\"], or paints [her eyes with kohl], or if she parts her hair [in the middle between the temples] \u2014 R. Eliezer rules (that one who does so is) liable [for a sin-offering: painting the eyes, by reason of \"writing\"; plaiting and parting, by reason of \"building\"], and the sages forbid it by reason of \"shvuth\" (\"resting,\" a rabbinic ordinance). [For they hold that these are not the customary ways of writing and building. The halachah is in accordance with the sages. And it is only one who removes his nails and his hair with his hands that the rabbis exempt from a sin-offering and from stoning. But if one does so with an instrument, they concur that he is liable for a sin-offering (when he removes two hairs). And if one pulls out the hair of his head, even with his hand, he is liable. And if most of a nail came loose, or most of a hair were torn, causing distress, it may be removed by hand ab initio.] If one tears off (a plant) from a flower pot with a hole, he is liable, [it being regarded as rooted to the ground in that it is \"nourished\" from the ground through the hole, absorbing the moisture of the soil (even if the hole is in the side.) The required size of the hole (in this connection) is that of a small root; and if it has no hole, he is not liable. R. Shimon exempts him in either case, [it not being considered as rooted to the ground to make him liable for stoning. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]"}}, "originalTitle": "\u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Mishnah Shabbat", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
