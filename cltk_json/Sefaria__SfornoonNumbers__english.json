The wise King Solomon, when mentioning that he had striven to unravel the wisdom in this legislation admitted that he had failed, that it was beyond him. (Kohelet 7,23). The thing which is most baffling in the red heifer legislation is that most who is ritually pure becomes ritually contaminated by direct contact with it, although the whole purpose of the red heifer, its ash, etc., is to purify the people who had been ritually contaminated prior to being sprinkled with spring water containing its ashes.<br> However, when we examine the entire commandment in detail we find that some of the people concerned with that red heifer from the moment it has been burned after having been slaughtered become ritually contaminated, i.e. the person burning its carcass, the person collecting its ashes, as well as the ones throwing the cedar wood as well as the one using the hyssop and crimson thread. into its burnt ashes. The same applies to all those either touching the remains or carrying them. <br>By contrast, the person performing the sprinkling with the mixture of the ash and water as well as the one sanctifying the location where the red heifer is to be burned and the one lighting the fire prior to burning the slaughtered red heifer are not contaminated by their activities.<br> One of the principal conditions concerning the red heifer is the requirement that it must not even have 2 hairs that are white or black. The symbolism of the colour red is supplied by the prophet Isaiah 1,18 who writes that even if your sins are as red as certain type or wool dyed red they can become white as snow under certain conditions of remorse.<br> Our sages considered this line so important that they used to tie a red string to the entrance of the Sanctuary when the scapegoat was thrown down on the Day of Atonement. This string would turn white as proof that the people\u2019s sins had been forgiven. When this happened the people would rejoice for the remainder of that day, whereas when it failed to turn white they would be greatly saddened. (Yuma 67)<br> We must remember that seeing that in the words of Solomon (Proverbs 30,5) \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4' \u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d4, \u201ceverything G\u2019d has said is absolutely pure, refined,\u201d He has no doubt kept in mind that all extremes are looked upon with disfavour so that His legislation must represent what Maimonides called the \u201cgolden mean.\u201d Solomon himself described any perversion as something deserving total failure. (compare Proverbs 28,18). <br>Furthermore, we must remember that when attempting to rectify something that has become bent out of shape by merely bending it in the opposite direction partially this will not restore it to its previous condition, but that it must be reversed completely in order to eventually be straight again. This is a principle applied by physicians in healing physical ailments, a principle described in Proverbs 20,30 as \u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05e6\u05e2 \u05ea\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05e8\u05e2, \u201cyou must eradicate wounds and injuries by using (what appear to be) harmful remedies.\u201d In other words, although the application of such remedies appears to run counter to the goal of preserving the golden mean, in such situations anything less drastic would never rectify the harm that had been caused by the injury. If similar means were to be applied to a completely healthy person they would, of course, be harmful instead of helpful. <br> A fifth consideration when contemplating the legislation in front of us is that the ash of the red heifer is effective in the context of ritual impurity only when the ritual impurity was caused by direct or indirect contact with a dead person\u2019s body. Any other kind of ritual contamination, such as blood of menstruation, dead creeping things, and a number of other causes of such ritual defilements are not affected at all by the treatment here described.<br> We know that Torah by definition is designed to improve the quality of life of the people observing its laws. The Torah spells this out in Deuteronomy 32,47 by writing: \u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, \u201cfor it is your very life.\u201d Anyone deviating from the laws of the Torah either is on the way to spiritual and physical death or is already at the point where, although he is walking around he is legally considered as dead. This is what the sages meant when they said that \u201cthe wicked are considered as dead although to all intents and purposes masquerading as alive.\u201d (B\u2019rachot 18).<br> A sixth consideration we must bear in mind in connection with this statute is that our sages consider the cedar wood as a symbol of haughtiness, arrogance, whereas they consider the hyssop herb as a symbol of humility (Erchin 16). When the two are paired with the red wool known as \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9, each alludes to something sinful. [the subject in the Talmud there is that a Torah scholar, though he needs to practice humility, nevertheless must maintain a certain amount of dignity so that people dealing with him do not get the impression that he is merely a \u201cwimp,\u201d a feeble ineffective personality. [Compare Sotah 5, discussing a saying by Rabbi Hunna son of Rabbi Joshua and the M\u2019iri on that saying. Ed.] Excessive humility in a person charged with leadership is as counterproductive as arrogance in an individual who has not been called upon to serve as a model to anyone.<br> Our sages quote as an example of excessive humility by a person in public life the humility of Israel\u2019s first King, King Sha-ul, who was punished by G\u2019d for not displaying authority when it needed to be displayed and allowed the common people to get away with making insulting remarks about him without disciplining them. (compare Yuma 22, reference to Samuel I 10,27- 11,13). Even later on in his reign when he excused himself for not having killed the best livestock of the Amalekites, Sha-ul cited his \u201cfear\u201d of the people a the reason why he did not protest the people\u2019s taking these as loot, something which had been forbidden (Samuel I 15,17). The prophet upraided him for behaving with his customary humility in public life, in the discharge of his duties as King.<br> Having said all this we come to the conclusion that although the whole red heifer legislation is a statute, a decree by G\u2019d which must not be questioned, and we must not, G\u2019d forbid, arrogate to ourselves to judge this legislation as suitable or not, seeing that everything G\u2019d has said is pure and refined, it does teach some exceptionally valuable lessons even when looked at superficially as we have done. Although people like Moses and others on a high level of wisdom may have had an insight into the deeper meaning of this statute, we must learn what we can from what meets the eye.<br> An important lesson of value to every penitent for every sin committed appears to be the one that in trying to rectify one\u2019s error, one must not content oneself to bend the \u201cbent iron\u201d back with the same amount of force it took to bend it out of shape in the first place, but one must strive to bend it beyond that so that in the future the likelihood of committing the same sin again will be reduced. {We encounter many \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 in our daily lives who appear to relate to certain commandments with what appears to be exaggerated stringency. No doubt they have taken to heart what our author just explained about how to straighten out what has been bent out of shape. Ed.]<br> The red heifer legislation and its details appears among other objectives to indicate a path for the penitents how to make their repentance effective and lasting. The principal element is a complete reversal of the path in life which led him to commit the sins he became guilty of in the first place.<br> One of the lessons we learn from the details of this legislation is that whereas the method described in our portion is effective for the sinner who wishes to cleanse himself of his sins, i.e. to address himself to his problem by using extreme measures, such extremism when used by anyone other than a repentant sinner would have the opposite effect, i.e. it would make out the previously unblemished, pure, ritually clean person the very reverse, would contaminate him with ritual impurity (a euphemism for his sins.) The sinner is permitted, nay encouraged, commanded to use extreme measures in order to eventually achieve the balance represented by Maimonides\u2019 ideal, the golden mean.<br> The Talmud Taanit, 11 in describing the procedure of the Nazir terminating his vow (Numbers 6,11) questions the line \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05d0\u05e9\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, \u201che will thereby atone for the sin against his soul,\u201d wanting to know what sin such a Nazir  could possibly have been guilty of? The answer given is that during the period of his abstinence from wine the Nazir experienced great distress over having to abstain from wine etc. It is reasoned that if the Torah describes a person who causes himself unnecessary distress in one small area of life as a sinner, how much more so will it consider a person who abstains from all food and drink a sinner? [the paragraph commenced with the sage Sh\u2019muel describing people who voluntarily practice fasts as sinners. Ed.]<br> Consider the fact that the instrument the Torah provides for ritually cleansing the person who had become defiled through contact with a deceased person as a mixture of spring water and ash from the red heifer. This mixture is composed of two extremes, i.e. residues of pure water and fire. Merging these two extremes appears (symbolically) is an excellent way of regaining the path known as the golden mean. Using this combination teaches us that this golden mean is what G\u2019d considers as \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4, ritual purity, as spelled out in the Torah\u2019s description of the function of the Day of Atonement, \u05de\u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05ea\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5 \u201cyou will become purified from all your sins before (against) the Lord,\u201d (Leviticus 16,30).<br> We have to contemplate the fact that the Torah decrees that a person who has been defiled by contact with a dead person must not touch the Tabernacle of the Lord, (verse 13) and that he must not enter the airspace of the Tabernacle on pain of contaminating it, (verse 20). I believe the hidden meaning of this regulation is that anyone who has been in too close contact with the vanities of the terrestrial universe (to use the phraseology employed by Solomon in Kohelet again and again) automatically will confer some of the pollution represented by these vanities to sacred things he comes into contact with. He will therefore taint the \u05e6\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, the Divine image in which he has been created. As a result, he must repair, remove such a taint in order to regain his former stature as an \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd. <br> Contact with the dead, results in an awareness of the transience of the lives of all of us, makes us aware of the negative aspects of our lives in this world; this is bound to leave a mark on our personality, one that may even border on considering life on earth as an exercise in futility, as indicated by Solomon when he speaks of such matters in Kohelet. The \u201cworld\u201d Kohelet describes, i.e.\u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05e9, as if it exists only beneath the sun, a material world only, would indeed lead its inhabitants to such conclusions.<br> We who believe in a world \u05de\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e9, beyond that serviced by the sun, fortunately have something better to look forward to if we prepare ourselves for this. [I have added remarks of my own to the words of the author but I am certain that these remarks reflect his message.

The author, following the view that gentile corpses do not confer ritual impurity when merely in the same airspace with a Jew, understands this halachah as reflecting the fact that only the body, the physical raw material is called upon to perform the commandments. <br>Seeing that even being in the same airspace as a dead person confers ritual impurity, it is not difficult to understand that people who engage in sprinkling the waters of the red cow and its ash on a person so contaminated, will in turn be affected by such contact with him, and will themselves absorb a degree of impurity, though much less severe, one that can be cleansed by immersion on a ritual bath the same evening. <br> People engaged in indirect procedures preparing the \u05de\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 will not become ritually impure as they were not in contact with the party to be purified at all.

Many commentators have difficulty understanding the words\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05ea\u05dd, \u2018you lacked faith\u201d in verse 12 as well as with the word \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05ea\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9, \u201cyou trespassed against Me\u201d in Deuteronomy 32,51, as well as the words \u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05e4\u05d9 \u201cyou rebelled against My command\u201d in verse 24 of our chapter here. <br>If it had indeed been G\u2019d\u2019s intention that they were only to speak to the rock, what purpose was served in commanding Moses to take the staff? If the sin consisted in that Moses struck the rock, something he had not been commanded to do, what was Aaron\u2019s sin?<br> However, when we scrutinise the matter (the quarrel) more thoroughly we must remember that G\u2019d\u2019s instructions were designed to bring home to the people how wrong they had been in their rebellious attitude. They were meant not only to become aware of this, but to repent it and to apologise for it, seeing that G\u2019d does not desire the death of the sinner but his rehabilitation by his own efforts. <br>Knowing that this is so, Moses and Aaron\u2019s actions or inaction resulted in G\u2019d\u2019s intention of bringing about the people\u2019s repentance of their conduct was thwarted. G\u2019d punished them for having become the instrument of thwarting His plan. <br>The quarrel of the people with Moses was that they accused him of a failure of leadership that resulted in their finding themselves in a situation where they even lacked water for survival. Their quarrel with G\u2019d consisted in their accusing Him of taking them out of a good land called Egypt and bringing them to a desert instead. G\u2019d had wanted to make it clear to them by means of the miracle that Moses had not acted on their own but had merely been His messenger, had carried out his mission faithfully, and that the One Who had sent him had not caused the people any harm at all. We must remember that there are three distinct kinds of miracles in Scripture<br> 1) The \u201chidden\u201d miracle such as that rain occurs when needed, or that people are recovering from a variety of life threatening diseases. These are the types of miracles that the righteous can bring about by means of their prayers. The Torah quotes an example of this kind of miracle in Genesis 20,17 when it tells us that Avraham\u2019s prayer resulted in G\u2019d healing the households in Avimelech\u2019s kingdom where an outbreak of a disease had resulted in none of the expectant women being able to give birth to their babies until after Avraham\u2019s prayer. A similar miracle occurred in Numbers 21,7 when Moses prayed on behalf of the people who had acknowledged that they had sinned.<br> 2)\tThe second type of miracle is an \u201copen\u201d miracle, something that could not be produced by nature without a special assist by G\u2019d, although it could conceivably be become a natural phenomenon over a long period of time. Examples of this kind of miracle are Moses throwing his staff to the earth and G\u2019d turning it into a snake (Exodus 4,5) or G\u2019d commanding Moses to raise his staff (Exodus 14,16)  and the waters of the sea parting, or Moses striking the rock in Exodus 17,6 in order to produce water from that rock. Kings II 13,17 is a similar miracle where Elisha by letting the king shoot arrows means to assure victory over the armies opposing Israel.<br> 3)\tThe third type of miracle is something that nature could never produce however long it practiced. It is a miracle to accomplish which only words are employed. G\u2019d, by means of His prophet, produces a result by means of mere words which demonstrates that use of intelligence without any physical action can produce phenomenal results. This kind of miracle within a material universe employs an absolute minimum of the tools that are the basic instruments of running this terrestrial universe. This is the type of miracle employed when the earth opened and swallowed Korach, etc. (16,31) or when at Joshua\u2019s command the orbit of both the sun and the moon were arrested (Joshua 10,12).<br> In our situation G\u2019d was about to provide the Jewish people with the demonstration of such a miracle in order to bring about their repentance when the people would become alert to the uniqueness of the prophet as well as to that of the One Who had made him His emissary, and Moses and Aaron deprived Him of that opportunity by preempting Him through hitting the rock. When G\u2019d said to Moses that the rock \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cit will give forth its waters,\u201d He meant that it would dissolve into water so that no one could claim that the source of its waters had been elsewhere and that the course of these waters had merely been diverted to make it look as if the stone had turned into water. Moses\u2019 high-handed action in merely striking the rock had been responsible for the fact that this type of miracle had not occurred, and that the aggrandizement of G\u2019d\u2019s name by the performance of such a miracle had not taken place. He himself had testified to this when he said in Deuteronomy 8,15 that G\u2019d is One Who \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 \u05dc\u05da \u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05e9, \u201cWho has produced water for you from the rock which is as hard as flint.\u201d The reason that he chose this adjective is clear. If the waters that gushed forth from that rock had merely been diverted from somewhere else, what difference would it have made if the rock were soft or hard as flint? <br> This type of miracle could never be produced by forces concealed within nature irrespective of thousands and millions of years of evolution. [my choice of word, but author\u2019s meaning. Ed.] G\u2019d had commanded that this type of miracle occur as a result of words spoken by His servants. This is the reason for the emphasis on the words \u05d5\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05dc\u05e2, \u201cyou are to speak to the rock.\u201d The Children of Israel were to be alerted not just to a miracle, but to the specific nature of this kind of miracle. Observing Moses in action in this fashion, they would get an inkling of the Power of the G\u2019d Who had employed him as His emissary.<br> They were to reflect on the fact that although G\u2019d/Moses had taken the people out of Egypt they had not suffered any harm from that at all seeing that their G\u2019d had been with them every step of the way. He had converted the desert into a pool of water on their behalf, had performed miracles totally beyond the latent powers of nature ever to perform. As long as G\u2019d was with them, i.e. in the words of Sukkah 53,\u05d0\u05dd \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05d0\u05df \u05d4\u05db\u05dc \u05db\u05d0\u05df, \u201cif I, the Lord, is present, everything you need is present.\u201d Jeremiah 2,31 phrased it thus: \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u201cwas I G\u2019d then a desert for Israel?\u201d (did I not provide everything that is otherwise lacking in a desert?)<br> G\u2019d commanded that as soon as the rock would yield up its water, Moses was to use his staff in order to guide separate streams of that water to the various areas in which each tribe had its tents, so that they would not have to leave their homes, as they did to collect the manna, in order to benefit from this vital resource.<br> This was the meaning of the words \u201ctake the staff\u2026..and extract the water for them from the rock and provide water for the congregation\u201d (verse 8). This is also the meaning of 21,18 \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e7 \u05d1\u05de\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd, \u201cwhen they split it with their staff.\u201d Moses and Aaron had agreed between them to carry out the second part of the miracle by bringing water to the people via the rock as they had done at Refidim when the Torah had described what would happen as \u201cwhen you strike the rock the water will come forth from the rock an the people will drink.\u201d (\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8, not \u05e1\u05dc\u05e2), (Exodus 17,6) <br> The type of miracle we had described as category three earlier is described here with the words \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd \u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e1\u05dc\u05e2, what Moses and Aaron agreed to do was the lesser level of miracle as they were not sure G\u2019d meant to perform the third category of miracle, i.e. not involving any action such as striking the rock. The reason why they doubted that G\u2019d was going to perform the latter miracle was that they did not considered the Israelites worthy at the time to experience this kind of miracle seeing they had acted in a rebellious manner, Moses himself having addressed them as \u05de\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, rebels. By performing the second category of miracle, the one which demonstrates only the elevated stature of the messenger, while failing to perform the third category of miracle which would also have demonstrated the exalted nature of the One Who had instructed them as His emissary they committed a serious error. This is the reason the Torah writes \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05ea\u05dd, \u201cyou did not have faith enough\u201d (verse 12). The meaning is not that they considered G\u2019d incapable of producing water from the rock by their merely speaking to it, but they did not believe that the circumstances at the time warranted that G\u2019d would put Himself out to such an extent for these people. Deuteronomy 32,51 makes clear that their sin of omission constituted a desecration of G\u2019d\u2019s honour."}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "2": {"0": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05e9\u05d4.

They were singled out for this penalty as they were the most honoured people of their time, and as such served as role models for others. There was no special merit due to which they would have been spared, as in Genesis 19,15 where the angels warned Lot not to remain in Sodom lest he too would be killed on account of the company he kept.<br> G\u2019d, in sanctifying them, i.e. placing them on a spiritually elevated pedestal so that they would not partake in all manner of secular pursuits, justified sparing them at that time. Now that, due to the sin of the golden calf, they had forfeited this spiritually elevated status, they had to be \u201credeemed\u201d in order to resume life on a more mundane level than that for which they had been destined. This is the meaning of \u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05ea\u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, \u201cyou shall redeem every human male firstborn.\u201d (Exodus 13,13).<br>We must not make the mistake of thinking that seeing that this verse was written before the sin of the golden calf, that the firstborn had already been subject to redemption at that time, i.e that G\u2019d had despised them as not fit to offer the sacrificial offerings. On the contrary, the \u201credemption\u201d of which Exodus 13,13 speaks, i.e. [without a simultaneous substitution of others in their place, Ed.] was only in order to permit these firstborn to also pursue a regular lifestyle when they would not be performing service in the Temple, etc. Without \u201credemption\u201d every object that has been sanctified is out of bounds for any mundane use whether passive or active, as it would constitute a demeaning of its holiness.

Ed.] Neither do we find the expression \u05e1\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, etc.<br> The reason for this ancient custom of treating the day of the new moon almost like a festival is that historically, success of the Jewish people in matters terrestrial has always been linked to the lunar cycle. The moon is a phenomenon which has no light of its own, a phenomenon which depends on receiving and reflecting light from an external source.<br> Although prior to the sin of the golden calf the Jewish people\u2019s fate was totally independent of any foreign domination, described as \u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea, a kind of absolute independence, freedom engraved on the Tablets (the first set no doubt), (compare Exodus 32,16) as well as Eyruvin 54 and Tanchuma, Ki Tissa 16), once they had sinned they (divested themselves of this privilege, (and) no longer made use of this \u201cRoyal crown\u201d at all times as did the other nations, so that they did no longer appear to enjoy this advantage over the other nations of the world. <br>Ever since that spiritual disaster, the Jewish people could enjoy their original privilege of independence from the restrictions imposed by the fact that one is part of the \u201claws of nature\u201d only on rare occasions in their history, whereas most of the time they were dependent on \u201clight\u201d, i.e. good fortune, from external sources not under their control. To that extent, their history reflects the situation of the moon with its periods of ascent and decline month after month. When the moon is not directly exposed to the light of the sun it becomes invisible. The expression \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05d6\u05dc \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, (Shabbat 126) means that the Jewish people do not generate light of their own, do not work at being masters of their own fate, but rely entirely on G\u2019d to guide their fates. They receive this Divinely emanated light when their deeds are pleasing to G\u2019d. <br>This is why in the parlance of our prophets G\u2019d Himself is referred to as: \u201c\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u201d Israel\u2019s source of light.

When Isaiah describes their state of being when sinful, he speaks of their G\u2019d\u2019s hiding His face from them, as Israel walking in darkness harassed by the gentile nations. (Isaiah 59,2).<br> Whenever the Jewish people\u2019s fortunes are at low ebb this represents a desecration of G\u2019d\u2019s name, i.e. His reputation, as the gentiles refer to us sneeringly as \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u201care these the ones who describe themselves as G\u2019d\u2019s special nation?\u201d We can understand what our sages have said in Gittin 58 that whenever the Jewish people are in trouble, G\u2019d is automatically forced to share their troubles. Having linked His honour to the honour and glory of the Jewish people, He suffers with us, (allegorically speaking). Whenever we suffer, whenever we are in a state of being oppressed, G\u2019d is described as saying that \u201cthe pirate has attacked Me and you simultaneously.\u201d<br> Seeing that the sin offering presented on New Moon\u2019s day is an atonement for the Jewish people who are the cause of preventing the light of the moon to shine, or the reason it shines so weakly when it does shine, the sages in our prayers on that day referred to that sin offering as \u05dc\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d3\u05dd \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05ea \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05dd \u05de\u05d9\u05d3 \u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0, \u201cto obtain atonement for themselves. They were to be a memorial for them all, and a salvation for their soul from the hand of the enemy.\u201d This is the reason that this is the only sin offering described as \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4', \u201ca sin offering on behalf of G\u2019d.\u201d Presentation of  this offering is also in respect of the damage the sinful behaviour of the Jewish people has inflicted on G\u2019d\u2019s image among the gentile nations. <br> When we read about the dialogue described between the moon and G\u2019d in Chulin 60, where G\u2019d is eventually described as saying to the Jewish people \u201cbring a sin offering on My behalf,\u201d (in expiation for My diminishing the light of the moon) what the sage (Rabbi Shimon ben Pezzi) wanted to explain by putting such strange sounding words in G\u2019d\u2019s mouth is that ultimately the reason why the moon was diminished was because seeing it has a kinship with the Jewish people and these did not always live up to their lofty destiny, the moon [as a celestial representative of G\u2019d Himself, Ed.] therefore has to suffer alongside with them for their shortcomings. Seeing this may not sound quite fair, G\u2019d allegorically ordered a sin offering to be brought by the Jewish people on New Moon\u2019s day in order appease the moon.\n"}, "11": {}, "12": {}, "13": {}, "14": {}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {}, "2": {}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {}, "23": {}, "24": {}, "25": {"0": "\u05d1\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, on account of the weeks of cutting, harvesting.

Moses was to make all the preparations necessary to arrange for the orderly entrance of the Israelites into the land of Canaan.<br>This involved first and foremost that the inhabitants of the camps of the Israelites be ritually pure in conformity with the Torah\u2019s imperative that the army of the Jewish people when assembled must be holy (Deuteronomy 23,15). Needless to say that it must not contain people who had not cleansed themselves of their ritual impurity. They also had to be certain that no members of the Israelite camp was the product of an illegal union between people whose incestuous relationship carried the karet penalty. The purpose of all this was that G\u2019d\u2019s Shechinah would rest on the troops, and that therefore victory would be assured and casualties minimized. <br>The Talmud in Sotah 11 and 31 relates that the Jewish people had 4 virtues to their credit on account of which they merited entering and conquering the land of Canaan already at that time if the sin of the spies had not intervened. We know that Moses was convinced that the conquest of the land of Canaan was at hand when he asked his father-in-law Yitro to remain with him and to partake in that event. (Numbers 10,29) <br>These merits were: 1) the altar had been successfully consecrated, the offerings of the Jewish people were being accepted by G\u2019d. 2) the Levites had been consecrated. 3) The Jewish people had demonstrated eagerness when observing the anniversary of the Exodus by performing the required ceremonies in difficult circumstances. 4) They had followed their G\u2019d to an inhospitable desert even though they had no idea if and when the cloud would lift and indicate that they were suddenly to break camp. Their entire situation was such that sometimes they would remain in the same spot for months or years, whereas other times they would break camp and re-establish camp after only 24 hours, all of which involved a tremendous upheaval when we consider that we speak about two and a half to three million souls. <br>In order to describe the various merits the Jewish people had in their favour at the time the Torah told us at this point about these events instead of relating them in chronological order, as we might have expected. Consecration of the altar occurred in the first month of the second year, so did the consecration of the Levites, and so did the celebration of the second Passover. Seeing that the beginning of the Book of Numbers speaks of events in the second month of that year, we could have questioned the Torah\u2019s sequence. However, the Torah had a purpose in delaying the report about the last mentioned events in order to demonstrate that had it not been for the disastrous mission of the spies everything would have been in place for an immediate ascent to the Holy Land. The entire paragraph is another illustration of the principle known as \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05d3\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, that the Torah is not a record of events in chronological order.

When the cloud lifted off the Tabernacle it began its journey in the direction of Kadesh Barnea, which was the first town in the land of Israel which the Israelites encountered on that journey, described as the journey across \u201cthe great and awesome desert\u201d in Deuteronomy 1,19, when Moses is quoted as recalling: \u201cwe arrived at Kadesh Barnea.\u201d"}, "11": {}, "12": {}, "13": {}, "14": {}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {}, "2": {}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {}, "23": {}, "24": {}, "25": {}, "26": {}, "27": {}, "28": {}, "29": {"0": "\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05da, so that in his old age he would not have to adjust to the different climate and food in a country he had not grown up in."}, "3": {}, "30": {"0": " \u05d0\u05dc \u05e0\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e2\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5.
