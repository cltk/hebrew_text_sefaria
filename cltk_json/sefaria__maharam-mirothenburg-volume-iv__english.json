A kohen should not read  after another kohen because it taints [the pedigree of] the first one, and so certainly he should not read the fourth or fifth [aliyah] because it taints both of them: it taints the first one, because those who leave after the second kohen is called up, who will say that the prayer leader (hazan) just found out that the first one was in fact a halal  and the order must start over, beginning with another kohen. And even if the [hazan] does not say \u201cRise, so-and-so the kohen,\u201d so what? Is it obligatory to call out \u201cthe kohen\u201d? Even though the contemporary custom is to call the name of those called up to the Torah, this is because otherwise they would bicker. It is nevertheless not obligatory to mention the kohen by name. Moreover, one need not even mention the name; rather, one may gesture with his hand that he should go up. I have heard that this is what R. Shmuel of Bamberg did.", "1": "Additionally, if a kohen is called after a kohen, it taints [the latter], for people will say that he is not a kohen, but a halal, since he is reading in a place reserved for an Israelite. It is akin to the case of a Levite reading after a Levite, which should not be done because it taints both: they will say that the Levite who reads the third [aliyah] instead of an Israelite is in reality an Israelite. So too here, if a kohen reads fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh, they will say that he is a halal.", "2": "Yet Simhat Torah, when a Levite or kohen is called up for Hatan Torah and Hatan Bereshit, it is different, because five have already been called up in accordance with the day\u2019s laws, and these two do not count toward that number. If so, there is no concern about those who come and go [during the reading]. Moreover, there is a break as we serenade them with liturgical poems. They are also called by the names Hatan Torah and Hatan Bereshit, and in most Jewish communities, the city\u2019s most prominent members accompany them to the podium. The matter is thus quite distinct.", "3": "In a city that is entirely kohanim, which does not have even one Israelite, it seems to me that a kohen would read twice (=the first two aliyot), and then they call women up, for anyone can complete the quorum of seven, even a slave, maidservant, or minor (Megilla 23a). R. Simha explained that this is not exclusively for a quorum of seven, but even for three,  for the mishna states simply in the third chapter of Megilla (24a) that a minor may read from the Torah and recite the translation. Granted, the Sages conclude there that a woman should not read from the Torah due to the honor of the congregation (kevod ha-tzibur), but where there is no alternative, the honor of the congregation is superseded by the taint on the pedigree of the kohanim called up to read, so that none will say that they are the sons of divorcees. ", "4": "In a city that has three or four Israelites, they read and then are called up to read again, like in the case of townspeople who have no one to read for them, where one person stands to read and then sits down, seven times in a row, as stated in Tosefta Megilla chapter 3.", "5": "Israelite minors who have reached the age of education also count toward a quorum of seven. Even though R. Simha wrote what the Yerushalmi (Rosh Hashana 3:10) states about a woman who recites a blessing on her husband\u2019s behalf, or a son on his father\u2019s behalf,  and did not R. Hiya say in the name of R. Yosi b. R. Nehorai that everything said about a minor is to provide him with an education?  \u201cthis was not said about a minor except to educate him\u201d? This is interpreted as referring to a case where he recites along with them, as we learn in a mishna there: \u201cIf a slave, woman, or minor was reading for him, he replies along with them verbatim. Here, too, the hazan reads along with them.", "6": "A city that is entirely kohanim, with no women, slaves, minors, or Israelites, should not read from the Torah. \n"}}}
