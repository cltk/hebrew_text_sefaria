And this stumbling block are the words of Torah, that a person does not have a firm standing on their truth unless he stumbles on them, to teach mistakes and be humiliated by them, and then one pays attention and understands. Under your hand they are - even I stumbled in my teaching and retracted [what I said]."}}}
