However, after this first day Moses could always enter the sanctuary outside of the Holy of Holies, i.e. up until the dividing curtain, \u05e4\u05e8\u05db\u05ea. Numbers 7,89 elaborates on this describing that \u201cwhen Moses entered the Tent of Meeting in order to speak with Him, he would hear the sound of G\u2019d\u2019s voice speaking to him from above the lid of the Holy Ark.\u201d\n"}, "1": {"0": "\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1 \u05de\u05db\u05dd, when he brings himself close to G\u2019d by means of a confession of his sins and by humbling himself.

Our sages paraphrase this when pointing out that the Torah does not write here \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05dd, your entire selves, but \u05de\u05db\u05dd, something emanating from you, i.e. \u201cby excreting the spiritually unworthy parts of you.\u201d (compare Rashi)", "1": "\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05d4\u05de\u05d4, if he chooses to offer a 4-legged mammal, it must only be from either the category of cattle or sheep and goats. Wild roaming, undomesticated beasts, are not permitted to be offered as sacrifices on the altar. This needed to be spelled out as we were taught in Deuteronomy 14,4-5 that the wild roaming beasts with the distinguishing features that make them \u201cpure\u201d animals are permitted for consumption by Israelites provided they have been slaughtered in the appropriate manner. The animals discussed in these portions as candidates for sacrifices are only the ones mentioned in our verse here, i.e. \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8 or \u05e6\u05d0\u05df. The Torah indicates that such voluntary offerings as are under discussion at this time may even be offered by gentiles and accepted on the altar of the Temple or Tabernacle. When Leviticus 22,25 proscribes offerings tendered by the \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05db\u05e8 what are meant are not gentiles but Jews who have become estranged to their G\u2019d, have renounced their religion and become meshumadim. These are far worse that gentiles born as such, and that is why G\u2019d rejects their voluntary offerings on His altar. Included are Jews who publicly desecrate the Sabbath. [Eyruvin 69 states that desecrating the Sabbath publicly is equivalent to violating all of G\u2019d\u2019s commandments. Ed.] There are three categories of offerings which may sometimes be voluntary and other times mandatory. These comprise the burnt-offering, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, the peace-offering, \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, and the gift-offering (non-animal) \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4. When they are offered by the poor i.e. bird offerings, only pigeons and turtle doves qualify among all the birds. Complementary offerings known as \u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05ea-\u05e9\u05de\u05df-\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 are also part of voluntary offerings on occasion. The sin offerings \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea and \u05d0\u05e9\u05dd are invariably mandatory offerings. This helps to explain the offerings of Hevel and Kayin and why the offering of Kayin was not accepted by G\u2019d. (Genesis 4,5) It consisted of material which G\u2019d had not designated as fit to be offered as a gift to Him. The Torah did not simply state that G\u2019d did not turn to Kayin, but that \u201cHe did not turn to Kayin and His gift.\u201d In other words, the reason He did not accept Kayin\u2019s offering was that it consisted of matter rejected by G\u2019d as unfit to be an offering to Him. On the other hand, when Noach offered a sacrifice G\u2019d responded not only by accepting it, without further ado, but He reacted to it as if it were the most pleasant smelling fragrance, \u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d7, although burnt flesh and fat most certainly does not exude a pleasant fragrance. What the Torah meant to say there (Genesis 8,21) was that G\u2019d accepted the parts of the offering which were fit to please Him as if it were sweet smelling fragrance. (as a result of that offering not only did G\u2019d promise never to bring another deluge, but He permitted man to kill animals for food, something that had been forbidden since Adam\u2019s sin or earlier). Interestingly, the Torah does not say that G\u2019d accepted all of Noach\u2019s offerings, presumably seeing that some pure animals that were of the free roaming category are not acceptable although these animals are fit to be eaten by Jews, and all the more so by gentiles such as Noach. (the author speaks about this in Genesis 8,21 claiming that prior to the giving of the Torah all of the species of \u201cpure\u201d animals were fit as sacrifices.) In connection with the sin offerings it is mandatory for the person trying to obtain forgiveness by means of such mandatory offerings to place his hands on the animal with all his weight, as if attacking it, and praying that it be accepted as a substitute of his own person. Each individual\u2019s sin offering possesses an element of what we are familiar with from the legislation concerning the communal \u201cscapegoat\u201d upon which the High Priest placed his hands, symbolically transferring the many sins of the Jewish people to that animal. (Leviticus 16,21) By means of this symbolic act, the humility with which the owner of the sin offering is to approach G\u2019d prior to gaining a chance of acceptance and forgiveness, has been demonstrated. As a result,\n"}, "2": "\u05d5\u05e0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cG\u2019d will be in a mood to forgive such a person.\u201d Seeing that there are so many different kinds of sin, some of which are merely sinful thoughts, not involving sinful deeds, it is appropriate to ask G\u2019d\u2019s forgiveness also for such sinful thoughts. This is best accomplished as a by product of the voluntary burnt offering called \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 by the Torah, an offering of which the priests only receive the skin and hair of the animal. The burning of the fat parts of the animal or the parallel fistful of flour and oil of the gift offering \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4, which is burnt on the altar, are the instruments that bring about this atonement for sinful thoughts. Obtaining forgiveness for sinful deeds (all of them committed inadvertently, of course) other parts of the bodies of the offerings presented as \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea or \u05d0\u05e9\u05dd, \u201csin offering or guilt offering,\u201d are required. Peace offerings, \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, on the other hand, are viewed (based on Tzefaniah 3,9) as if the owner joins, becomes a partner with the angels, he and they serving their Lord jointly."}, "1": {"0": "seeing that sinners are always on different levels morally and ethically, some being more prone to sin than others, the Torah addresses these different groups of people in different ways, each one appropriate to their specific rating in society. The Torah begins with the High Priest, the one who is least likely to commit a sin, and writes: \u05d0\u05dd \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd, implying that a sin by the High Priest is most likely the outcome of guilt by the people, their conduct having contributed to his committing such an error. The Talmud (Berachot 34b:29) quotes that if someone makes an error in his private prayer this is a bad omen for him. If, however, the cantor, i.e. the person hired to pray on behalf of the people makes an error, not only he but all those on whose behalf he offered his prayers will suffer the consequences of his error. The sacrifice of a priest who committed an error must be burned and no one derives the slightest benefit from such an offering. Such considerations account for the fact that the Torah did not write here \u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05dd, \u201che sinned,\u201d which would have been a warning for the errant person to do teshuvah. Had the Torah phrased its address to the High Priest thus this would not have been appropriate as the error committed by the High Priest did not originate within his heart but his faulty prayer had been due to the sinfulness of the people he represented which had insidiously influenced the words he was uttering.

The Torah here warns of the need to do teshuvah, i.e. all those concerned, before proceeding with the sacrifice, as the sacrifice would be useless unless all the people had confessed their errors.

We pointed out already that different people who feel the need to offer this sacrifice are motivated by quite different considerations. The variety of sacrificial offerings provided for by the Torah corresponds roughly to the variety of human personalities and the considerations motivating their actions.  The Torah mentions as a salient feature of the burnt-offering, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, that the entire animal is offered on the altar for \u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d7, \u201csweet smelling fragrance,\u201d although only a small part of it is actually going up in flames. It is this small part which is truly the sacrifice called \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4. Further parts of that sacrifice (animal) [which burned to ash from the heat but did not go up in flames. Ed. ] are deposited \u05d0\u05e6\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7, next to the altar after having turned to ash. Those parts are referred to as \u05d3\u05e9\u05df, containing a certain degree of moisture which gives the fire a chance to smolder within them. This is meant by the words \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05d4\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4, some of it, when completely turned to ash is removed outside the camp while the priest carrying same wears garments of a lower rank. Even though these ashes are just that, ash, the place they are being consigned to cannot be just any dump but must be a site described by the Torah as \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8, ritually pure. [A significant ingredient of this \u201cTorah\u201d, (call it symbolism if you will) of the Olah is the \u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05d3, the burning center of the altar.

On a national rather than an individual level, the Purim story is an illustration of what the author means. Ed.] One of the reasons the Torah requires so many individual loaves of bread as part of the Todah sacrifice, is to enable as many people as possible to become aware of someone having been miraculously saved.

The main reason for the \u201cwaving\u201d is on account of that chest, to signal that actually it too belongs to G\u2019d. There was no need to wave the fat, seeing we all know that the fat of every sacrificial animal always belongs to G\u2019d via the altar on which it is burned up.", "5": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5 \u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05db\u05d4\u05df, from the part which belongs to the owners; we may view the priest in this instance as similar to the King\u2019s minister who, when someone who comes to offer a gift to the king, accepts a smaller gift meant for the king\u2019s servant in order to secure an audience with the king by the person bearing the larger gift.

(Pessachim 59) The reason is simple; how could the person offering the burnt offering expect it to be welcome in the eyes of G\u2019d if he still required atonement for a sin in order to be in G\u2019d\u2019s good graces? David paraphrases this in Psalms 40,7 \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d0\u05dc\u05ea, \u201cYou do not ask for burnt offerings and sin offerings.\u201d This bull became a \u201csin offering\u201d after having been anointed, a procedure similar to the anointing of the High Priest for his office.

Severe errors by the High Priest are the ones listed in Leviticus 4,3 or 4,13 by the Supreme Court. Such errors require that the blood of their sin offerings be brought into the sanctuary itself.

G\u2019d stated that the purpose of the Tabernacle was for Him to take up residence therein so that His essence should not feel disgust at the Jewish people. (Leviticus 26,11). Unfortunately, the golden calf episode had brought about a cardinal change in G\u2019d\u2019s relationship with the people so that He would not allow His Presence to dwell among them even briefly, refused to accompany them on their journey (Exodus 33,3) By means of his lengthy prayers Moses accomplished some improvement in this relationship of G\u2019d to the Israelites by means of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, the priests  performing service there, etc. Finally, the people attained the state of grace described as \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd, \u201cthe glory of the Lord appeared to the whole people.\u201d (Leviticus 9,23.) This manifestation of the \u201cglory of the Lord\u201d was the descent of fire from heaven to devour the offerings of the people in the Tabernacle. A way had now been found to refine the character of the people in attitudes and by application of their intelligence so that they would qualify for eternal life (life after death of the body). The method chosen for this was the refinement of the foods eaten by the people. G\u2019d forbade consumption of the kinds of foodstuffs which exert \u2013over a period of time- a negative influence on the people\u2019s character and their intelligence. This is spelled out by the Torah in verse 43 of our chapter where the rationale of the legislation is \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e9\u05e7\u05e6\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, another way of saying \u201cdo not contaminate your souls.\u201d This is only the effect of observing the negative commandment not to eat forbidden things. There is a positive aspect to this legislation also called \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05ea\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea\u05dd \u05e7\u05d3\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u201cif you will sanctify yourselves you will remain holy.\u201d (Leviticus 15,31). When G\u2019d added \u05db\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d3\u05d5\u05e9 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9, this was an incentive to attain the dimension of eternal life similar to G\u2019d. In addition to legislation involving our physical foodstuffs, the Torah introduced legislation designed to refine our body\u2019s other appetites, that of the libido. Legislation governing a husband\u2019s marital relation with a woman who is a menstruant, or who suffers diseases of her sexual organs, or experiencing childbirth (\u05e0\u05d3\u05d4, \u05d6\u05d1\u05d4, \u05d9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea) are intended to sanctify human sperm and to cleanse if from all spiritual contamination, \u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05d5\u05e3. Compare Leviticus 15,31 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d6\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05ea\u05dd, \u201ccaution the Children of Israel to abstain from their pollutants.\u201d If they would fail to do so they would forfeit this claim to eternal life. Here the Torah introduces this subject of ritual impurity in connection with animals. In this whole paragraph \u201cdefilement\u201d is brought about either by direct touch, indirect touch such a carrying or moving the object by pushing it. Only such animals a are liable to confer contamination of our souls are capable of conferring immediate ritual impurity. Fish, birds, locusts and other creeping things are not capable of conferring such ritual contamination of a person by means of contact other than by means of ingesting them.. The Torah uses the expression \u05e9\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e5 to describe their negative fallout when dead instead of the expression \u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4.

We base ourselves on the oral tradition as spelled out in Nega-im 1,1. None of these phenomena correspond to the skin diseases we read about in medical text books. Such phenomena as are mentioned in these textbooks do not result in the afflicted person being considered ritually impure, nor are they subject to the priest deciding if indeed the symptoms require isolation of the afflicted person and when such symptoms can be declared as having disappeared.  According to Berachot 5 the only skin afflictions which may be viewed as G\u2019d\u2019s reminder to improve our lifestyle are the four kinds mentioned in our chapter. While they are not classified as afflictions revealing G\u2019d\u2019s love for the person thus afflicted, they are however, described as \u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 \u05db\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4, as \u201can altar serving as stepping stone to atonement for the character weakness that the afflicted person has to overcome.\u201d G\u2019d does not employ any other medically well known skin diseases as His instrument to call us to order for various sins committed. \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0, anyone who goes to a place to be attended to is not referred to as \u201ccoming,\u201d \u05d1\u05d0, but as being brought, i.e. \u05d4\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0.  Compare Psalms 45,15.

The Torah repeats this same expression twice in successive verses, and also the expression \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 is repeated both in verse 8 and verse 11. Sometimes, as here and as in verse 22, the word \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 is added. The reason may be that this affliction, in common with other afflictions, is something that develops in stages. Just as the affliction intensifies gradually in its early stages, so it gradually becomes weaker on the way to healing. When it is already a long-standing affliction it is referred to as \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e9\u05e0\u05ea, whereas when it is in its opening stages it is called simply \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2. When it is a fully fledged affliction it is called \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea. When it is in the process of waning it is already referred to as \u05e0\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea, an affliction which has healed. When it has healed completely it is referred to as \u05e0\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7. Seeing that this type of affliction is perceived as a warning signal from G\u2019d to the individual experiencing it, i.e. he is reminded to get rid of negative characteristics, the Talmud refers to it as \u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 \u05db\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4 \u201can altar serving as atonement.\u201d The period of isolation serves to remind the afflicted person to review what he may have been guilty of. This concept has been spelled out in Job 36,10 as \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05e1\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05df, \u201cHe opens their understanding by discipline, and orders them back from mischief.\u201d", "2": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8, even though the sages (Shevuot 6) have said that everything which looks white is described a looking deep, recessed, as the sun appears as if deeper than the shadow, so that the wording of our verse appears to be incompatible with the statement of the sages, seeing that the skin itself is a form of something whitish the Torah means that the relationship of the normal skin to the whiteness of the tzoraat is comparable to the appearance of the shadow to the sun. [a spot of shadow on a bright day, is after all not \u201cblack\u201d as is the darkness of the night. In fact, compared to the darkness of the night, it might be viewed as a weak \u201cwhite.\u201d Ed.]", "3": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df, it is a decree by the Torah that only a priest is qualified to determine what is ritually pure and what is ritually impure in all matters pertaining to these skin afflictions. The prophet Maleachi 2,7 echoes this concept when he says that \u05db\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9 \u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d3\u05ea, \u201cthat the lips (pronouncements) of the priest will preserve the Jewish religion.\u201d The priest is also required to counsel the afflicted person to examine his lifestyle so that he himself will become the key to his rehabilitation. At the same time the Priest will add his own prayer when asking G\u2019d to heal the afflicted. Apart from his prayer his expertise will tell him when the stage has been reached when the affliction has waned so that the count toward rehabilitation and the presentation of offerings can begin.", "4": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05df \u05e9\u05d0\u05ea \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4, this spot is not being judged by the same criteria as listed earlier which were inflammations of skin on the flesh; similarly, inflammations caused by fire burning the skin. When ordinary \u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05df destroys the tissue on top of the skin it never grows back to look as it did originally. What grows on the afflicted area is tissue which resembles the original skin, so that no skin graft is needed. Original skin is medically irreplaceable. [opinions in those days.] When someone suffers from a \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea the skin, when healed, looks indistinguishable from the original.", "5": "\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7, a skin affliction in a part of the skin normally covered with hair is called a \u05e0\u05ea\u05e7. The word implies that the affliction uproots the hair follicles with the hair. This hair was not pulled out by human hands or by some kind of chemical or medication. The fact that some black hair remains in the skin proves that notwithstanding the other symptoms suggesting that the person suffering the affliction is ritually impure, the black hair\u2019s presence saves him from such a determination by the priest.", "6": "\u05db\u05d4\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea, below that which appears like the skin of an egg concerning which the sages taught us  (Maimonides Tum\u2019at Tzoraat 1,11", "7": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d1\u05d2\u05d3 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea, when it is quite clear that this is not the kind of stain familiar to science and responsive to removing by chemical detergents. Discolouration of a garment in colours other than the ones that are work related due to the vocation of the wearer, are usually caused deliberately by the owner. What occurred here is due to some sin the owner was guilty of. <br> At any rate, our tradition has taught that the only discolouration of garments or cloths that are considered from a halachic point of view are garments which themselves are white and not coloured. Any coloured garment is not subject to this legislation at all, is not within the parameter of what is called \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea. The phenomenon of white garments or exterior walls of houses which are normally whitewashed breaking out in different colours is by itself a warning to the owner to examine his lifestyle and what he might have done wrong to rate such a warning. <br> Our sages in Kidushin 20 tell about how seriously a violation of a rule which is only peripheral to the Sh\u2019mittah legislation is viewed. [the basic rules of sh\u2019mittah relate to working the soil during that year. What I described here as \u201cperipheral,\u201d i.e. in Talmudic parlance as \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e9\u05de\u05d8\u05d4, is the dealing in produce grown in violation of the sh\u2019mittah laws. Ed.] The Talmud explains that violating the \u201cperipheral\u201d aspects of that legislation my result in the guilty party becoming impoverished. The process is gradual so that the guilty party had ample opportunity to ask himself why G\u2019d had singled him out for this kind of punishment.<br> The same is true of the \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea  legislation. Proof of the fact that this affliction is due to a well meaning Creator, One Who is concerned with the welfare of His Jewish subjects, is the fact that if the symptoms we know as \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea surface on the garments of gentile or houses of gentiles, these are not declared as ritually impure. Seeing that the gentiles as a rule do not have life in the hereafter to look forward to, G\u2019d is not at such pains to warn them not to risk losing something they doe not to look forward to in any event. When a Jew is in danger of losing his claim to eternal life this is a far more serious matter, and G\u2019d goes out of His way to afford the person potentially endangering his claim to eternal life an opportunity to repent and change his lifestyle before it is too late. In referring to this concept, Solomon in Proverbs 10,25 describes the \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7, the Just, as the foundation of the universe. The whole idea of man having been created in G\u2019d\u2019s image, and G\u2019d\u2019s desire for man to become as much like Him as it is possible for a creature to become, lies at the source of this concern by G\u2019d not to let man waste his opportunity to live up to his destiny. <br> Once man becomes aware of G\u2019d\u2019s concern for him he will have little difficulty in making his own will correspond to the revealed will of His Maker. He will begin to realise that by \u201clistening\u201d to the urgings of his body-dominated desires he risks losing his eternal life and the death of his body would also signal the death of his life force \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, just as that of all the animals. &gt;br&gt; Even though we see many people defy G\u2019d in their lifestyles, we can be sure in the words of G\u2019d in Exodus 23,7 \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7 \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2, \u201cthat I will not allow the wicked to appear as if he were a just person for ever.\u201d [the author, in continuing this sermon, describes all the gentiles and most of the Jews of his time, as so oblivious to all this that they may be compared as existing in a permanent state of spiritual coma. Ed.] Nonetheless, if G\u2019d chose the Jewish people as His special people it is because He entertains the fond hope that out of this nation there will emerge a nucleus of people who are aware of their destiny. When the Jewish people are predominantly in the state of spiritual coma the author just described, the symptoms described in our portion will not appear as it would be a waste of time to hope that the people thus afflicted would see in these symptoms a message from their G\u2019d."}, "11": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df, to a site near the boundary of the encampment where the priest can come to inspect the afflicted person easily without having to subject himself to special effort.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5, similar as in 13,45 \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4, baring something, tearing it, removing the offending part.", "2": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, part of the general theme \u201che will make his residence outside the camp\u201d (as long as he is afflicted) (compare 13,46)", "3": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05e5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, in line with the previously mentioned instruction \u201che must pitch his tent outside the camp.\u201d (verse 8)", "4": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e9\u05dd.  It has already been explained in 7,1 as well as in my commentary on Leviticus 1,2 that the guilt offering, \u05d0\u05e9\u05dd in the main applies to inadvertent sins committed involving misuse of sacred matters, or misuse of the sacred domain of the Temple, such as unauthorised persons entering it, or ritually unclean persons entering it, etc. Just as in the case of the sin offering, \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea, if that sin had been committed deliberately it would have resulted in the karet penalty, and if not atoned for through teshuvah would have resulted in the guilty person\u2019s eternally being cut off from the collective soul of the Jewish people. <br>Our sages in Erchin 15 and 16 have already stated that the principal sins for which a person is afflicted with the \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea, are bad-mouthing people and haughtiness, both of which are perceived by the sages as direct trespass against G\u2019d\u2019s Holiness. Even though badmouthing is generally perpetrated in secret not affording the victim a chance to defend himself against the accusation and character assassination, the prophet Isaiah 29,15 views it as the perpetrators saying \u201cwho sees us, who takes note of us?\u201d In other words, the prophet considers the \u201csecrecy\u201d as worse than the sin itself, as it suggests that G\u2019d is unable to see it, and therefore represents a gross insult directed at G\u2019d.<br> Concerning arrogant, haughty behaviour. We read in Psalms 101,5 \u201cHe who slanders his friend in secret I will destroy; I cannot endure the haughty and proud man.\u201d G\u2019d is portrayed as if the sinner is \u201ctrying to steal part of G\u2019d\u2019s \u201cclothing.\u201d G\u2019d declares that such people cannot co-exist with Him in the same universe. (Sotah 5).<br> We have evidence in our scriptures (Chronicles II 26, 16-19) that King Uzziah\u2019s arrogance was punished with tzoraat for his haughtiness, as this sin was considered a trespass against G\u2019d Himself.\n", "5": "\u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05df \u05d5\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, he will have attained a sufficient level of ritual purity to be allowed to partake in sacrificial meats, and entering holy precincts (if he is otherwise qualified to do so).

Simultaneous to this the priest will announce the period of isolation.

The author speculates that the cause may be overly frequent indulgence in the sex act, which in turns leads to insufficient time for the seminal fluid being replaced properly, etc. If that were the cause, a cause brought about by fantasizing about the sex act too often, the remedy, in part, would be the seven days during which the afflicted person counts towards his being healed, reflecting on the part his lifestyle played in causing the symptoms from which he suffered.

[the ritual impurity of the zav was induced by a diseased body, as opposed to menstruation which is a natural state ever since the original sin. Ed.] There appears to be a dichotomy there. The Torah teaches that when a man is violating sexual mores he causes more spiritually negative fallout to himself than when a woman does the same thing in reverse. At least, there appears to be a difference between sickness induced by individual sin, such as zav and zavah as well as in the case of tzoraat, which we explained as also a sickness due to individual sin, not to the spiritual state of man, the species, since the original sin.

They even used to employ such demons for errands to distant countries. We have documented proof of this in the case of Joseph Shida [the demon named Joseph].(Sanhedrin 59, compare Nachmanides) and about the demon who was prominent in the household of Rav bar Rav Ashi (Chulin 105). Had such demons been considered deities it is inconceivable that people of Rav Ashi\u2019s stature or Rav Pappa\u2019s stature would have had any track with them whatsoever.<br> It is reported in the Talmud that whereas little is known about the manner of these demons\u2019 creation, they are known to eat and drink just as human beings. It is further worthy of mention that the sages, collectively, referred to the phenomenon of the demons as \u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, destructive, harmful phenomena. They multiply in a manner similar to humans and they die a regular death. They see without being seen themselves.<br> Apparently, although they are composed of composite material, their bones are extremely thin and transparent. The author speculates that just as ordinary human beings in common with the animals possess a \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u201cintangible life-force\u201d which, seeing that it dies with the body it inhabits, as distinct from the human \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 which is an intangible spirit emanating in the celestial regions, is basically terrestrial in nature, these demons are \u201cpowered\u201d by such a life-force. The reason we find that \u201clife-force\u201d referred to on occasion as \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 is the fact that it cannot exist without its tangible partner, the one which feeds on food and drink secured from what is available in our terrestrial universe.<br> Consider the very fact that the Torah describes \u201cblood as the life-force\u201d (Deuteronomy 12,23). If someone were to sacrifice blood to such a creature, especially, seeing that it is powerful enough to sustain the life of such creatures, the blood sacrificed to such creatures would be equivalent to keeping these demons alive. (compare Maimonides, Moreh Nevuchim,3,46 on the subject).<br> This would be a violation of the statement in Chulin 105  \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d3\u05e6\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d7\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05db\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc \u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05df \u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d0 \u05dc\u05de\u05e9\u05e7\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e2\u05d4. This is a conversation between the \u201cowner\u201d of a demon, Mar bar Rav Ashi, according to which the demon who had not paid back a loan on time to the \u201cowner\u201d claimed that his power to collect objects in this world did not include objects which were clearly defined and visible. From this Tossaphot Taanit 8 divrey hamatchil \u05d0\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 concludes that if clearly defined and visible phenomena in this world were out of bounds to the demons unless they were definitely ownerless, phenomena which are not visible to us humans belonged to the category of phenomena over which such demons did have control.<br> At any rate, when a situation exists when many people find such demons useful and pliable to their wishes, people indulged in offering them blood so as to endear themselves to these creatures and to get them to perform their wishes. The people offering these gifts of blood used to eat it themselves also, in order to share more common ground with these creatures. Some people even made a point of consuming the blood of such \u201cgifts\u201d to the demons in the vicinity of the Temple. They were under the impression that these demons were performing their dances in that vicinity. They hoped to ingratiate themselves with these creatures by showing them this kind of \u201crespect.\u201d<br> When G\u2019d decided to sanctify us and He separated His people from dependence on such demons and taught us not to pursue such ultimately useless phenomena and put our trust in them, seeing that contrary to a superficial perception they are really mazikim, destructive forces, as our sages correctly described them, He levied a severe penalty on people who continue such relationships as they used to entertain with demons. The penalty of karet means severance from one\u2019s own people\u2019s eternal future. (verse 10)<br> G\u2019d levied a similar penalty on eating blood and offering gifts to these demons as He had levied at the time in Gan Eden when he forbade eating from the tree of knowledge on pain of man becoming mortal, i.e. losing an aspect of his infinity on this earth. (Genesis 2,17). The Torah rationalized its prohibition and the severity of the penalty by stating: \u201cfor the soul (intangible life-force) of the flesh is in the blood.\u201d This is the Torah\u2019s way of referring to the almost invisible essence of these creatures. On the one hand, this essence is called nefesh \u201clife-force,\u201d on the other hand it is referred to as blood, as once the blood stops coursing through the veins of the body it feeds it is the end of the existence of both the body and life force of such creatures. G\u2019d added (verse 11) \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05db\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 \u05dc\u05db\u05e4\u05e8, \u201cI have given you an opportunity to present this blood on My altar in order to facilitate your atonement for your life-force.<br> The point G\u2019d is making is that as opposed to these demons for whom such blood is an essential part of their nutrients, enabling them to stay alive, I, the Lord, do not need anything like this for Myself; on the contrary, I have provided you My people with an opportunity to remain alive yourselves by achieving atonement for your sins by means of sacrifices involving the life blood of the animal you are offering.<br> Sacrifices, offerings, in order to be meaningful as expiation, must be in a certain reciprocal relationship to the donor. If the donor had been guilty of forfeiting his life, only someone else\u2019s life, in this instance the blood of the sacrificial animal, can possibly achieve this kind of atonement in lieu of the sinner\u2019s lifeblood himself. Other parts of the sacrificial animal being burned up on the altar, similarly, correspond to the parts of the body of the donor which had been guilty of committing the sin for which the donor hopes to atone.

We know that this is so from the Torah\u2019s prohibition of trying to derive spiritual inspiration from the dead or parts of them.

In fact, the Talmud Yevamot 62,63 praises someone who marries his niece by quoting Isaiah 58,9 who calls down a special blessing from heaven on such a person. [\u201cThen when you call, the Lord will answer, when you cry, He will say: \u2018Here I am.\u2019\u201d] <br> The considerations I have just mentioned are valid only if both parties to such a marital union are motivated exclusively  by the desire to carry out G\u2019d\u2019s will as they perceive it. However, truth to tell, this occurs in only rare cases. The vast majority of people, when choosing their mate, are driven by the desire to gratify their libido. Compare Psalms 51,7 \u05d4\u05df \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05d5\u05df \u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05de\u05d9, \u201cIndeed, I was born with iniquity; with sin my mother conceived me.\u201d <br>Seeing that genetically close relatives, usually living under the same roof, provide ample opportunity for the males and females of that family to engage in illegitimate sexual relations, and not only do they find it enjoyable but they do not consider it at all sinful, such pairings will hardly ever be for the purpose of marriage, but merely for the purpose of mutual physical indulgence. As a result, allowing marital relations of an incestuous nature would result in sexual promiscuity of major dimensions. This is why the Torah wrote \u05dc\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05d4, in most instances the very baring of flesh, and especially private parts, is the physical gratification desired in the first instance. This is why the Torah, in order to nip incest in the bud, addresses itself again and again to this phenomenon by using the expression \u05dc\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05d4, the titillation provided by feasting one\u2019s eyes on the flesh of the opposite sex. When listing degrees of blood relationship, the Torah proceeds from the man\u2019s vantage point, and in the case of the woman from the perspective of her husband. This is why in order of sequence the Torah first forbids the sister of one\u2019s father who is a first degree blood relation to one\u2019s father. On the other hand, the Torah permits the daughter of such father who is a relative of the second degree to the party. The Torah then prohibits the wife of one\u2019s father and the wife of one\u2019s brother and the wife of one\u2019s uncle, even after their respective husbands have already died. This is in spite of the fact that no genetic connection exists between the people forbidden to one another as man and wife. The reason is simply that they Torah views them all from the perspective of how they are related to their husbands. This appears to be the guideline for all incest-related legislation.\n", "1": "\u05d6\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0, it is sexual union based only on lust and sinful intent.", "2": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e7\u05d7 \u05dc\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8, the Torah means that were it not for the competitive hostility which would result by the two sisters competing for the love of the same man, there would not have been a biological, genetic reason for forbidding such a union.

Our sages spelled this out in Kidushin 31 where they said: \u201csometimes someone feeds his father the most delicious and expensive dishes while the manner in which he does this contributes to the son\u2019s losing his share in the hereafter, whereas on the other hand, a son could earn his share in the hereafter even by expecting his father to perform physically hard labour.\u201d In the latter case, the son explains to the father lovingly why he cannot offer him luxuries but he treats him with love and concern and listens to his father\u2019s words of advice.

Al these types of \u201cSabbath\u201d legislation are testimony to the fact that the Creator Who legislates such laws was the originator of the universe, hence His right to demand such obeisances from His creatures.\n"}, "2": "When the Torah now continues with the second of the Ten Commandments by warning us \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e4\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, the Torah elaborates that it is not only forbidden to make oneself such deities in order to worship them, etc., but that it is equally prohibited to display respect for such deities worshipped by other peoples as their gods.

We are to perform acts of charity and righteousness. Part of such acts of charity are the providing for the underprivileged out of the bounty G\u2019d has seen fit to grant us.

Do not allow one litigant to sit down while his opponent is required to remain standing upright. This is followed by admonitions applicable to different levels of leadership in the people and the spirit of jealousy which often prevails between competing layers of the bureaucracy. Examples are: Doeg badmouthing David so as to gain favour with the king. (Samuel I 22,9) From such admonitions it is only a small step to warn against badmouthing people generally, especially when it even involves slander. The sin of slandering is considered so serious by the prophet Ezekiel that he describes it as being equal to bloodshed (Ezekiel 22,9)", "9": "There follows a general, all inclusive rule to be observed in relations towards one\u2019s fellow, phrased as \u05d5\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea \u05dc\u05e8\u05e2\u05da \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05da, telling us to apply the same yardstick to our concern for our fellow that we would want applied to ourselves if we were in his shoes in similar situations.\n", "10": "One of the foremost ways in which to demonstrate our fear/reverence of the Lord is not by observing commandments which we find reasonable and useful, but by observing those commandments which we fail to understand, or worse, which run counter too what our intelligence dictates to our mind as being useful.  Hence the Torah urges: \u05d0\u05ea \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5, you must make a special point of meticulously observing G\u2019d\u2019s statutes. The motivation for doing so must not be merely fear of punishment, but blanket recognition that \u201cFather knows best,\u201d that the fact it was G\u2019d Who legislated these statutes proves that they are intelligent and beneficial for us even if we fail to understand this. It is interesting that the Torah enumerates examples of such chukkim in areas which have nothing to do with \u201creligion\u201d as such, but with the most mundane of our activities. Examples are: the efforts to produce better strains of domesticated animals, better strains of agricultural products, etc. In each of these situations, even though scientific research may lead us to conclusions other than the ones indicated by the Torah, we must ignore such results of our own research. [I am updating the wording of the author to make them more relevant to our century. Ed.] Clearly, He Who created this universe would not legislate something that would endanger its existence. What applies in the field of agriculture, our economic base, applies equally in the sexual mores we are to observe [including such matters as \u201ccloning\u201d Ed.] as well as our foods, [maybe outlawing certain kinds of additives, in addition to such matters as mixing milk and meat. Ed.] Even in such apparently unrelated matters as trying to divine the future, the Torah is on record with a variety of statutes limiting our methods of enquiry. All of these laws, of course, come under the heading of chukkim, statutes.\n", "11": "It is a fact that most of the statutes listed appear to forbid only things which appear opposed to what we are familiar with as \u201claws of nature.\u201d The prominent exception to this is the legislation involving the \u05e9\u05e4\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d7\u05e8\u05e4\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9. Surely, the fact that the male partner does not become subject to the penalty of 39 strokes whereas the female partner does, appears hard to understand and to reconcile with what logic dictates. Furthermore, the fact that the male partner in the sin is required to offer a guilt offering, \u05d0\u05d9\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05dd, although he committed the sin knowingly, seems completely at variance with what we know about the function of such offerings.<br> Nonetheless, the Torah herself provides a partial answer to this unusual legislation by writing \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d5\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4, his sin is viewed as somewhat less serious seeing that she had not been legally capable of entering a binding marriage, the requisite financial token signifying her betrothal to the man being legally meaningless as she could not \u201cown\u201d anything, still being enslaved to one of her former masters. His principal sin consists of desecrating the institution of marriage, a Divine institution, hence a desecration of G\u2019d\u2019s name when ignored. Engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman who is still partially a slave is a form of practicing promiscuity. [my words. Ed.] The scenario described by the Torah denigrates in the first instance the dignity of the active partner, the male, not that of the passive partner the female. It is most likely, that she, the \u201cpassive\u201d partner had seduced him and is therefore deserving of the penalty decreed for her by the Torah. The deliberate nature of the sin, as far as the male is concerned, is the fact that he knowingly demeaned himself. This makes it akin to an inadvertent sin, qualifying for the guilt offering decreed. \n", "12": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d3\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e0\u05d7\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5, all of these practices were commonplace also among the Israelites who were desperate to gain advance knowledge of what was in store for them individually.

Neither are we to make incisions on our skin, something that is customary amongst pagans as an expression of their grief for family members who have died. Excessive mourning of this kind could be interpreted as questioning G\u2019d Who allowed the departed to die. The same applies to a well known method of tattooing one\u2019s skin with indelible ink below the skin, a permanent defacing of one\u2019s body, described as \u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05ea \u05e7\u05e2\u05e7\u05e2.

Allowing or encouraging one\u2019s unmarried daughter to devote her life to one of harlotry is a major desecration of one\u2019s purpose on earth.

We might therefore have thought that seeing that in the donor\u2019s eyes he presents a superior gift to G\u2019d this would be acceptable; the Torah takes a dim view of castrating animals which were created to proliferate.

If the owner of said animal, or the priest offering it on his behalf, intends to consume it or part of it outside the holy precincts allocated for such eating by the Torah, or said owner plans to eat it past the deadline set by the Torah for consumption of such sacrificial meat, the sacrifice not only becomes disqualified but the penalty is extremely harsh.

On some of these days one has to abstain from such activities completely, on others only partially. For instance, on the Sabbath as well as on the Day of Atonement there is a total cessation of everything which is called \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d4, work, in the sense of a productive activity. These days are meant for us to occupy ourselves exclusively with Torah and other sacred tasks. To this effect the Torah wrote (Exodus 20,9-10) \u201cyou shall labour for six days and conduct all your activities, whereas the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your G\u2019d.\u201d On that day your activities should concern spiritual matters. On some of the days described as holy convocations there is a partial prohibition of work, desisting basically from the kind of activity related to the kind of labour involved in earning one\u2019s livelihood. One is to enjoy these days. Concerning such days, our sages coined the phrase \u05d7\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4' \u05d5\u05d7\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05db\u05dd, \u201chalf for G\u2019d and half for you.\u201d (Pessachim 68) There is no doubt that when the Jewish people conduct themselves in this fashion that the Divine Presence will be at home among them. Assaph expressed this thought in Psalms 82,1 which commences with the words \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e6\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0-\u05dc \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5', \u201cG\u2019d stands in the divine assembly.

The reason this is spelled out is that we might have thought that just as days and nights are not constant, being longer in the summer than in the winter respectively, so that the hours of the first Sabbath in history might serve as the model for all future Sabbaths, and Jews over the world ought to observe the 24 hours which Jews in the land of Israel observe as their Sabbath. The Torah, by writing \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, indicates that the commencement and conclusion of the Sabbath depends on the local times of day and night, not on a central location.

The sages are empowered to see to it that the annual calendar date which the Torah legislated for this sacrifice to be offered coincides with the month in which the spring equinox occurs, so as to ensure that we do not violate the concept of \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1, \u201con this day you left (Egypt) it was during the month of spring.\u201d The concept of \u201cspring\u201d and its message of resurrection of nature which had hibernated during the winter is so strong that it is part of the \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d4' concept.

The whole matter of the mussaph, additional communal offerings, has not been gone into in detail here as this is a subject treated in Numbers when this legislation appears in detail in chapters 28-29. The reason why in connection with the New Year\u2019s day the Torah does mention the offering of an \u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4', is that this day already qualified for a mussaph offering, it being not only the first day of the new year but also the first day of the month of Tishrey. In Numbers 29,6 the Torah once more draws our attention to this fact, [presumably to tell us that New Year\u2019s day does not replace the significance of the date of the new moon. Ed.] If you were to counter that \u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4' is also mentioned in this chapter in connection with the day of Atonement, remember that what is referred to there are  burnt offerings and sin offerings, both on behalf of the High Priest and the people but not by each individual member of the people as are sin offerings generally, not mussaph offerings which are mandatory communal offerings.", "4": "The reason why the Torah listed the Sabbath and the festival of matzot in a single paragraph is that both were legislated prior to the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Each of the other festivals has been accorded a paragraph of its own.", "5": "The Torah commences its reference to the festival of weeks by speaking of the Omer, and the counting of the seven weeks from the Passover until that festival, seeing that the festival of weeks is also known as the harvest festival,\u05d7\u05d2 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8 and we thank the Lord for the \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05d3, \u201cwho keeps for our benefit the weeks appointed for harvest\u201d (Jeremiah 5,24). The principal reason for the festivals is to afford us an opportunity to express our gratitude in prayer and in deed. For instance, an example is the appointed time for the festival during spring when we pray to G\u2019d giving thanks for His having given us our freedom at the time of the Exodus from Egypt. The Omer was an expression of gratitude for the barley harvest, the earliest opportunity to fulfill part of the bikkurim legislation, presenting the first of the ripened crop to G\u2019d. This prayer also contains a request concerning the future. The counting of the 49 days between Passover and the festival of weeks reminds us of the need to offer such prayers on a daily basis. On the festival of Sukkot, the festival of ingathering, we thank the Lord for having enabled us to bring the year\u2019s major harvest under our roofs.", "6": "\u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, the prohibition to eat from the new barley harvest before the 16th of Nissan applies even when there is no Temple and no Omer offering can be brought to G\u2019d.", "7": "\u05d7\u05de\u05e5 \u05ea\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, the Omer was the first ripened barley; the offering mentioned in our verse here represented the first ripened stalks of the wheat harvest.

This is why the Talmud in Rosh Hashanah 8 calls on us to recite verse 4 in the above mentioned chapter of Psalms which reads \u05ea\u05e7\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05e9\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d1\u05db\u05e1\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d7\u05d2\u05e0\u05d5, \u05db\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, \u201cblow the horn on the new moon on the day the moon is veiled, on our feast day, for it is a statute for Israel a ruling of the G\u2019d of Yaakov.\u201d On such days we have additional reason to rejoice in the fact that He is our King, who inclines toward leniency, and is likely to find us as possessing sufficient merit to pass this examination of the way we led our lives in the year just concluded. Isaiah  expresses these sentiments in referring to G\u2019d as \u05db\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05e9\u05d5\u05e4\u05d8\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d4' \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e7\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d4' \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cfor the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King\u201d (Isaiah 33,22)", "11": "\u05d0\u05da \u05d1\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9, even though on all the other days described in this chapter as \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 it is proper to express our joy on these days by means of food and drink, as we know from Nechemyah 8,10 where Ezra asks the people on New Year\u2019s day \u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05e9\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05e9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05de\u05de\u05ea\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, \u201ceat choice foods and drink sweet drinks,\u201d the tenth of this month the day known as Yom Hakippurim, Day of Atonement, is a day devoted to confession of our sins and a day when a person comes to grips with the sins he has been guilty of. On this day it is not in order to  preoccupy oneself with anything other than the quest to obtain G\u2019d\u2019s forgiveness and to achieve expiation of one\u2019s sins. Instead of eating and drinking, the order of the day has been best expressed by Isaiah 58,3 \u05d4\u05df \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e6\u05d5\u05de\u05db\u05dd \u05ea\u05de\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d7\u05e4\u05e5 \u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05ea\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5\u05e9\u05d5, \u201cbecause on your fast day you see to your business and you oppress your labourers!\u201d [the prophet sarcastically chastises the people who, while technically fasting, expect G\u2019d to listen to their requests while they continue in their wicked ways, going only through the motions in their religious observance.

The latter pertains to abstaining from ordinary secular activities, whereas the former entails spending a certain amount of time performing holy tasks, studying Torah, engaging in communal prayer, etc. The expression \u05e0\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8 occurs in this context in Samuel I 21,8 \u05d5\u05e9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05de\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e0\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4', \u201cand there was a man, one of Saul\u2019s officials detained before the Lord, etc.\u201d  In Yoel 1,14 we find the line \u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd, \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05d4, \u201csolemnize a fast, proclaim an assembly!\u201d In Kings II 10,20 we find that Yehu proclaimed an assembly in honour of the Baal, [he meant to make sure that he could kill all those who would worship the Baal, which he succeeded in doing, eradicating this cult from Israel.

The joy on that day was to be a Torah inspired and oriented joy, akin to when David says in Psalms 149,2 \u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05d7 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cIsrael rejoices in its Maker.\u201d<br>We find that the description of the family dinners held in the home of Job\u2019s children, his seven sons and three daughters, at set intervals such festive get togethers were held. On the day after the completion of these festivities their father would send word to them to sanctify themselves and rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings to atone for the possibility that they might have been remiss and committed some misdemeanour which would have displeased their G\u2019d. (Job 1,4-5)<br> On the seventh day after the Exodus from Egypt the Israelites took time out to sing a song of thanksgiving to G\u2019d for their final delivery from the pursuing Egyptians. Subsequently, in commemoration of that occasion, the Torah decreed that this day become an \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea, a day devoted to contemplation of the great miracle on that first occasion. (Compare Exodus 15,1 and Deuteronomy 16,8).<br> Again, on the fiftieth day after the Exodus when the Israelites in a great assembly at Mount Sinai spent the day contemplating their elevation to an almost supernatural people, this day was also subsequently observed as an \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea, although in the Torah this day is never referred to as such. The reason why the Torah itself does not refer to this day as an \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea may be the fact that shortly thereafter all the accomplishments of this day were lost and the Jewish people were even commanded to divest themselves of the \u201cjewelry\u201d they had worn in commemoration of that wonderful day.

Such a concept does not exist as a special, day in the \u201cweek,\u201d nor on the festival of matzot, neither in connection with months or years. In respect of all of these only the number seven has a connotation of holiness, not the number eight.<br> 2) This is the only festival in which the Jew is required to change his home, move out of his regular home, as stated clearly in verse 42. <br>3) it requires that every Jew take four plants of specific categories and wave them in the 6 directions on earth.

This is especially so since we are all aware that blaspheming against G\u2019d does not harm Him in any way, is an exercise of man\u2019s frustration, not something harmful to the object of his blasphemy. The Torah explains that the reason why this blasphemy is treated as if something of substance, G\u2019d forbid, must be seen in a different context. We know from Torah legislation that each deliberate act of disobedience against G\u2019d is basically an act of insurrection, mutiny, and we could expect it to be treated as such, i.e. as equivalent to forfeiting one\u2019s life.<br>Nonetheless, the Torah has demonstrated that some deliberate sins rate quite different punishments than others. Basically, the Torah provides for financial penalties, physical punishment, and the death penalty. Clearly, this proves that G\u2019d views different sins as differing in degree of insurrection, or due to different degrees of provocation experienced by the sinner. Killing a human being, basically deserves the death penalty, i.e. anything less would mean that the killer\u2019s life is worth more than that of his victim. When someone kills an animal, this is not comparable, so that the penalty is financial, restitution to the owner for what he lost.<br> When someone causes injury (deliberately), if the injury was caused to a fellow human being, by rights, the offender should be punished by bodily punishment, unless he were physically too weak to endure such punishment. Seeing that it is impossible to impose an exact equivalent for the injury caused, the sages decided to substitute a financial penalty instead. We must not think that the offender thereby gets off lightly, as the financial compensation comprises five different categories of harm suffered by the injured party, including even his injured pride. (compare Baba Kamma 83)<br>When someone injures an animal the financial penalty is considerably milder. When someone causes injury to a human being we also distinguish between one human being and another. If he injured his father or mother, he is guilty of the death penalty, whereas an injury of similar severity to someone else draws only a financial penalty; when he injures an animal it is obvious that the penalty would only be financial. Cursing father or mother is not mentioned in the Torah here as it is in a different category altogether, seeing that this cannot be compared to blaspheming, words which by themselves have no effect, since what can man possibly do to harm G\u2019d?. Parents may be harmed by their children\u2019s curses though not necessarily visibly. [some of the wording is my own.

The only time such locations are mentioned is when a new element of that commandment is added. We have heard about the principle of the sh\u2019mittah legislation in Exodus 23,11 where the general outline was presented, the Torah writing that the produce of the land during the seventh year should be left untouched by the farmer and is intended for the poor of the nation.<br>Now the Torah reverts to present this legislation in greater detail. This is the reason why we are told where these details were first spelled out. What we read here is only a prototype. The principle does not apply only to the sh\u2019mittah legislation, but wherever some legislation had been mentioned in a general manner only, when the details were filled in this took place at Mount Sinai, just as it did in the case of the sh\u2019mittah legislation.

The meaning of this reflexive conjugation is as if the Torah had written: \u201cI will walk with you in whatever direction you are going, back and forth and sideways.\u201d In other words, G\u2019d says that He will not limit His benevolent presence to a single location or route of His choosing as it was as long as the Temple or Tabernacle stood, and only these locations were holy domains, the people having to come there if they wanted to experience sanctity and holiness. While it is true that this had been the primary objective in Exodus chapter 25 when the command to build the Tabernacle had first been issued, this was only an initial step in regaining the closeness between G\u2019d and Israel which had been shattered due to the sin of the golden calf.

This intention had been briefly realised again at the revelation at Mount Sinai, only to have again been aborted when the golden calf was made and the people danced around it. When G\u2019d said in Exodus 6,7 \u201cI will take you to be My people and to be your G\u2019d, He had meant the restoration of man\u2019s original perfection as he had been when first created, becoming the gift of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai. <br>On the other hand, Deuteronomy 29,12 when G\u2019d also speaks of the result of the covenant being that He will be the G\u2019d of the Jewish people, He did not refer to such lofty ideals at that time. At that point the Torah was satisfied with ensuring the uninterrupted function of the Tabernacle as the home of the Shechinah on earth. This was the reduced objective we had heard about in Exodus 29,45 when G\u2019d spoke about making His residence among the Jewish people in that Tabernacle, not wherever they would be in areas beyond the Tabernacle. G\u2019d would indeed be the Jewish people\u2019s G\u2019d, with all that this entails in terms of His personal providence, but He would not be described as dwelling \u201camong\u201d them, or \u201cwithin\u201d them, depending on how we want to understand the word \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05db\u05dd.
