And R. Adonim [=Dunash] says that if that were the case, it should have a hiriq under the lamed [i.e. libah], as in \"el ginat egoz\" [Song of Songs 6:11]. But he has forgotten \"ukheganah zro'eha tatzmiah\" [Isaiah 61:11]. \"The bush\": the sage says this was a sort of thorn bush."}, "2": {"0": "This was told to him in Midian...", "1": "And it happened in the way - They had a tradition that an eight-day son should not be circumcised if he was sick or traveling since there wasn't a possibility for delaying the travel. And this was because Moses could not be delayed in his Divine mission. He saw by his own counsel not to circumcise, since the youngster would be in danger if he was put to travel. And behold, HaShem sent an angel to remind Moses to pause himself and circumcise the child and go on his way on his own. And the youngster would stay with his mother until he healed, and behold the reason of \"he met him\" is that sickness from HaShem came to Moses that he didn't think of it. And this is \"he sought to kill him\" if he didn't circumcise his son. And due to the trembling that seized him he wasn't able to circumcise his son, and Tzipporah circumcised him, because he revealed to her the secret. And do not be surprise to read \"HaShem met him\" because it was an angel/messenger of HaShem. And like [this verse, we have] \"And HaShem walks in front of them during the day\" (Exodus 13:21) and there it is written \"And God's angel traveled\" (Exodus 14:19). And Rav Shmuel ben Chofni says God forbid that God would want to kill Moses, who goes in a Divine mission to save his people! He just wanted to kill Eliezer. And the sign is that \"he met him\" and \"he wanted to kill him\", and after \"him\" is explained to be Eliezer, because it is written \"the foreskin of her son\", and this is not explicit in the beginning, since his name had not been given yet. And like [this verse, we have] \"And it was on her giving birth, and he put his hand\" (Genesis 38:28)", "2": "And he went- The Elders were the advisors in in every generation.

The answer is that Hashem gave wisdom to man, and placed insight into his heart to be able to draw additional power to increasegood, or to detract from his evil, as i will explain later .......But the reason for the hardening of his heart is to increase My miracles.
