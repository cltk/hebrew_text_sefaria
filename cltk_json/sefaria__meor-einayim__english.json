We find that every thing was created by way of the Torah and the power of the actor is in that which is acted upon, in which case the power of the Torah is in each thing and in all the worlds, and also in the person as is written, <i>This is the Torah: A person</i> (Num.\u00a019:14) as we will clarify. And the Torah and the Holy Blessed One are one (Zohar\u00a01:24a), so we find in all things the life-force of the Holy Blessed One. <i>And you give life to them all</i> (Nehemiah\u00a09:6), you contract, as if it were possible, down to the lowest levels; and a portion of Divinity from above is placed within the darkness of materiality. For the whole essence of the intention is so that the lowest levels can rise above and have <i>the advantage of light over darkness</i> (Ecclesiastes\u00a02:13).", "And this is the meaning of Joseph\u2019s descent to Egypt, the lowest levels, \u201cthe ocean strait;\u201d for through this enjoyment is increased as is written, <i>the advantage of light</i>, that enjoyment advances when it is lifted <i>over darkness</i>, and therefore he is called Joseph, connoting addition [<i>tosefet</i>]. And that is [the meaning of the verse (Gen.\u00a042:1)] <i>when Jacob saw that there was grain</i> [<i>shever</i>] \u2014 connoting breakage [<i>shvirah</i>], which are the degenerations of Heavenly Wisdom, Torah that has fallen and broken; all that descends from its level is called \u201cbroken.\u201d  <i>In Egypt</i>, in the ocean strait: for he saw there degenerations of Torah that fell there and needed to be clarified and elevated. And he said, <i>Go down there</i> (Gen.\u00a042:2) to elevate and descend to bring [them] to the life-force of the root and the self. And that is the meaning of <i>Joseph died</i> (Gen.\u00a050:26), for the fact that the Torah descended until the final level is called \u201cdeath,\u201d for whatever descends from its level is called \u201cdeath\u201d (Zohar\u00a03:135b). <i>And they embalmed him</i> (Gen.\u00a050:26): for the Torah is called \u201cTree of Life,\u201d and with trees we go according to the ripening of fruit, which is to say even though he descended to the final level he bore fruit. <i>And he was put in a coffin</i> (Gen. 50:26), as in the statement [of our Sages] of Blessed Memory, \u201cThe Tablets and the Broken Tablets were placed in the ark\u201d (Bava\u00a0Batra\u00a014b): even the degenerations have elevation to be in the ark just like the Tablets, which are the Torah itself. And we will return to the matter at hand: since in every thing it is the Torah that gives that thing life, one should not look at any thing in its materiality, only at the internality of the thing in the secret of <i>The wise person has his eyes in his head</i> (Ecclesiastes\u00a02:14); and in the Zohar they said, \u201cAnd where else should a person\u2019s eyes be? Rather, a wise person gazes to see who stands above his head\u201d (Zohar\u00a03:187a), which is to say that in every thing he should gaze toward the beginning of that thing: from where it evolved and who is that thing\u2019s root.", "And that is [the meaning of] <i>With the beginning created</i> etc., with the Torah were created <i>the heavens and the earth</i>, which are the collective of everything and all things within them. And as was stated by our Sages of Blessed Memory, \u201c\u05d0\u05ea includes the derivatives;\u201d <i>and the earth</i>, which is to say one who is immersed in worldliness, <i>was chaos and void</i>, since he does not gaze at the life-force and of their own accord they are <i>chaos and void</i> [<i>tohu va-vohu</i>]. And Rashi explained that a person is astonished [<i>toheh</i>] and amazed at the emptiness [<i>bohu</i>] within it, which is to say that someone who is \u201ca person\u201d is astonished at the fool who is immersed in worldliness: for \u201cit is within him\u201d [<i>bo hu</i>], which is to say that the Holy Blessed One\u2019s life-force is within him, yet he does not understand and distances himself from [God]! But when a person looks in all things toward the life-force he fulfills <i>I have set YHVH before me always</i> (Psalm\u00a016:8), that in every matter he sets before him \u201cExistence,\u201d the one who forms all existence.", "And our Sages of Blessed Memory said, \u201cAnyone who learns not for its own sake, it would have been better for him if his placenta had been overturned\u201d etc. (Kallah\u00a0Rabbati\u00a05.1); but another time they said, \u201cA person should always engage in Torah and mitzvot, even if not for their own sake, since through [the performance of mitzvot] not for their own sake, [one] comes [to perform them] for their own sake\u201d (Pesahim\u00a050b). And we can understand this along these lines: for we can ask, how can you find the aspect of \u201cnot for its own sake\u201d in the world, when the life-force of all things is the Torah \u2014 and who is it that gives life-force to the aspect of \u201cnot for its own sake?\u201d But is it not the case that one learns not for its own sake on account of some evil characteristic, or because of human self-glorification or self-aggrandizement, or an account of desire for money and the like? And that is a characteristic of glorification that fell into brokenness; but its essence is glorification of the Creator and [God\u2019s] desire. And this [person] took the glorification and desire for himself; but when he understands that this evolved from the Creator\u2019s glorification, and from his love grasps onto the thing\u2019s root and beginning \u2014 for <i>The wise person has his eyes in his head</i> as we have stated \u2014 we find that when he gathers the thought of desire and glorification into himself, he returns through it to its root, we find that he comes from the aspect of \u201cnot for its own sake\u201d immediately to the aspect of \u201cfor its own sake.\u201d And that means a person should always engage and teach himself that through \u201cnot for its own sake\u201d he brings himself into \u201cfor its own sake.\u201d But when he does not do this and remains in \u201cnot for its own sake\u201d \u2014 that is when they said, \u201cIt would have been better for him\u201d etc.", "Now, the Torah is called \u201clight,\u201d <i>but the fool walks in darkness</i> (Ecclesiastes\u00a02:14), for he engages not for its own sake; but one who sites in darkness must kindle a light. And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>and darkness over the face of the deep</i>, because he is immersed in worldliness and does not kindle the light of Torah; and on accont of this we find the aspect of \u201cnot for its own sake\u201d in the world. Regarding this it says, <i>And the Spirit of God hovers over the face of the waters</i>, that through this one can return and bring oneself to the essential life-force and [God\u2019s] Divinity as we have said.", "<i>And God said, \u201cLet there be light.\u201d</i> When a person engages for its own sake, for God\u2019s sake, his speaking then kindles light. Initially, light and darkness served in mixture; for the Torah is called \u201clight\u201d and the foreign turning is called \u201cdarkness.\u201d But now <i>God separated the light from the darkness</i>.", "And that is [the meaning of the Sages] of Blessed Memory\u2019s statement, \u201cWhy do goats [<i>izzim</i>] walk in front?\u201d (Shabbat 77b), which is to say Israel, who are called \u201cstrongest\u201d [<i>azzim</i>] of the nations as in [the Sages] of Blessed Memory\u2019s statement (Beitzah\u00a025b). What is the reason they have the power to go and attach themselves to the Head, which is the beginning of everything? And they said that \u201cat first [it] was dark,\u201d they are in the darkness of the levels, and they return from there to light, attaching themselves and elevating themselves from there to light, and sweetening the small mind with greatness; therefore they have this power. But this is not true of the Nations of the World, who remain in smallness and materiality; and therefore our Sages of Blessed Memory said about Balaam, \u201cHe does not even know how to divine the mind of his animal!\u201d (Berakhot 7a), and it is understood.", "A person is created small \u2014 in small mind \u2014 and yet the Holy Blessed One\u2019s intention in creating humanity was to serve [God], so why did [God] create him initially without mind, without awareness to serve [God]? But this is also for the previously stated reason, for <i>wisdom has the advantage over folly</i> (Ecclesiastes\u00a02:13), and darkness yearns to merge into light (Zohar\u00a01:17a). For smallness is considered \u201cfeminine\u201d with respect to greatness, <i>Your desire shall be for your husband</i> (Gen.\u00a03:16). The feminine awakens longing in the groom; the person is initially in the aspect of smallness and afterward, when he comes into great mind, he attaches everything \u2014 even the smallness \u2014 to greatness and he has the aspect of \u201ccoupling.\u201d And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you</i> (Isaiah\u00a062:5), and it will be clarified elsewhere. And it is impossible to come to the light of greatness immediately, therefore smallness comes first. And that is the second interpretation [of the question], \u201cWhy do goats [<i>izzim</i>],\u201d which means a person\u2019s arrogance [<i>azzut</i>], \u201cwalk in front.\u201d That is to say, smallness comes to a person first; and the answer is \u201cAccording to the creation of the world, which at first was dark\u201d etc. as was stated.", "And that is [the meaning of the verse] <i>And God called the light Day</i> etc. \u2014 just as there is no day without night, just so <i>there was evening</i>, which is the smallness first, and afterward <i>there was morning</i>, the great mind that inspects his deeds. <i>One day</i>: they are made into a single unity. And this is the general order according to which every person should walk, that upon arriving at thirteen years awareness should enter him. \u201cAwareness\u201d connotes attachment from the lower level to the upper; and that is complete awareness along the lines of <i>Return, wayward children</i> (Jeremiah\u00a03:22), which is to say things that have been made <i>wayward</i> as in <i>he went wayward in the way of his heart</i> (Isaiah\u00a057:17), return and attach together. However, there are those who do not merit awareness even at thirteen years, and they are called \u201csmall.\u201d And a person who has no awareness is seduced after his Inclination; and that is the meaning of the seduction that is written in the Torah, in the incident of Potiphar and Joseph. And one must save oneself as Joseph saved himself.", "And my Teacher, may he be remembered for life in the World to Come, commented on what [our Sages] of Blessed Memory said, that he saw a vision of his father\u2019s image (Sotah\u00a036b) and the clothes that she wore for him in the morning she did not wear for him in the evening (Yoma\u00a035b): but Joseph gazed at the source of beauty and glorification \u2014 from where does it come? For the essence of glorification is God\u2019s life-force, which is the characteristic of Jacob, Splendor. And that is [the meaning of] \u201ca vision of his father\u2019s image;\u201d and we find that each person needs to do so."], "1": {"0": {"0": "<i>Noah walked with God</i> (Gen. 6:9) Rashi explained: \u201cBut regarding Abraham it says, [<i>Walk before me</i> (Gen. 17:1)], <i>Before whom I have walked</i> (Gen. 24:40); Noah needed assistance to support him, but Abraham strengthened himself with his righteousness and walked independently.\u201d But this is difficult to understand as well, for does the verse not say <i>[Noah was a] completely righteous [man]</i> (Gen. 6:9)?  And if [Rashi\u2019s comment is correct,] then he is not \u201ccomplete\u201d since he lacks the level of Abraham!", "1": "But it is known that everything depends on Arousal from Below, which is the aspect of Feminine Water like the Desire of the Feminine for the Masculine.  And we, the Nation of the Children of Israel, have the aspect of Feminine with respect to the Holy Blessed One; and when we arouse ourselves to attach to our Blessed Creator from Below to Above, we arouse (as if it were possible) Desire in our Blessed Creator to channel us all Good, <i>selah</i>!  And the flow descends from Above to Below with abundance and blessing and compassion and life and peace. So we, the Assembly of Israel, along with the Holy Blessed One are a single complete entity, when we are attached to Blessed God.  And one without the other (as if it were possible) is not called \u201ccomplete,\u201d as in the statement \u201cThe Name is not complete nor is the Throne complete\u201d (Tanhuma, Ki Tetze 11).  For we are called the Blessed Creator\u2019s Throne, since (as if it were possible) without us the Blessed Creator is not called \u201ccomplete\u201d and obviously without Blessed God we [are not called \u201ccomplete\u201d]. Only when we first arouse the Feminine Waters, meaning our Desire from Below to Above to attach to Blessed God, through this we arouse Blessed God\u2019s Desire from Above to Below.  And then, when the two Desires come together then it is one complete entity.  And this is the meaning of the verse <i>You shall be complete with Adonai your God</i> (Deut. 18:13), which is to say you with Blessed God are called a complete entity. And so the essence of Creation was on this condition, that we would walk to Blessed God by way of Arousal from Below initially.  And if not, God forbid, meaning when we do not arouse ourselves through Arousal from Below and need Blessed God to arouse us from Above, then we have done nothing. And so regarding Noah there was no Arousal from Below, [and Noah was saved] only because Blessed God wanted the preservation of the world, which would be preserved through Noah.  Therefore Blessed Good needed to arouse him from Above, and needed to channel onto Noah the Desire to attach to Blessed God.  And this is [what Rashi meant by] \u201cNoah needed assistance to support him.\u201d  But Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, \u201cstrengthened himself with his righteousness and walked independently\u201d through Arousal from Below. And now it makes sense that [Noah] was called <i>completely righteous</i>, since he was attached to Blessed God but not through Arousal from Below; and therefore it is written, <i>These are the records of the skies and the earth in their creation</i> [<i>be-hibar\u2019am</i>] (Gen. 2:4), the letters of \u201cAbraham\u201d \u2013 meaning, as we have explained, that the Essence of Creation is through this: that the way of walking is like the walk of Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, through Arousal from Below as we have explained.\n"}}, "2": {"0": {"0": "<i>Go yourself</i> (Gen. 12:1): Rashi explained, \u201cFor your pleasure and your benefit.\u201d Now, our Sages of Blessed Memory said, regarding the verse, <i>Do you indeed, who are mute, speak righteousness?</i> (Psalm 58:2): \u201cHow should a person act in this world? Let him make himself as a mute. Could this even apply to words of Torah? The verse teaches, speak righteousness\u201d (Hullin 89a). For it is known that it is written, <i>Lord, open my lips</i> (Psalm 51:17), because the Blessed Creator, <i>the whole earth is full of [God\u2019s] glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3), no place is void of [God]; but [God\u2019s] glory connotes cloaking as is known, that Blessed [God] is cloaked in each thing. And this aspect is called Shekhinah because it dwells [<i>shokhein</i>] in each thing; and that is the Blessed Name <i>Lord</i>. And it is also called the world of speech since <i>By the word of YHVH the heavens were made</i> (Psalm 33:6) and \u201cthe Holy Blessed One created the world through Torah\u201d (Zohar 1:5a), meaning through the twenty-two letters of the Torah \u2013 the world of speech \u2013 all the creations were created. And it is stated in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>,  \u201cThey were set in the human mouth\u201d (<i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> [Luria ver.] 2.3), and that is the meaning of Lord, open my lips. And therefore our Sages of Blessed Memory said that \u201cEvil speech is equivalent to idolatry\u201d etc. (Arakhin 15b), for a person who speaks evil speech does not believe that his words are the world of speech, the charateristic of Lordship. And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?</i> (Psalm 12:5), as we have explained elsewhere.", "1": "And that is [the meaning of the Talmud\u2019s statement], \u201cMake himself as a mute,\u201d meaning his essence. That is, he should not speak any speech unless he believes that of his own account he is mute, and his only speech is the world of speech, the characteristic of \u201cLord\u201d as we have explained. And they ask: \u201cCould this even apply to words of Torah,\u201d that a person should not learn unless he believes as we have explained? \u201cThe verse teaches, <i>speak righteousness</i>,\u201d it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to learn even if it is not for its own sake. And that is [the meaning of] what our Sages of Blessed Memory said, \u201cSomeone who converses meaningless conversation transgresses a positive commandment, as it says, <i>you shall speak of them</i> (Deut. 6:7) and not of meaningless things\u201d (Yoma 19b). And it would seem, how could it be possible that a person should speak no speech other than words of Torah as is implied by the language of <i>you shall speak of them</i> etc.? But the explanation is this: <i>you shall speak of them</i> means to say that whatever you speak, you should believe that you speak with the Torah, whose speech is the world of speech, the twenty-two letters of the Torah as we have explained. And when you speak through world-guiding, do not worry, for the Holy Blessed One created the world through Torah and guides the world through Torah; all the world are led by the twenty-two letters of Torah, the world of speech, but only if you believe this as we have explained. But if you speak not for the sake of world-guiding, that is called \u201cmeaningless things.\u201d", "2": "And that is also [the meaning of] what our Sages of Blessed Memory said, \u201cLet all your deeds be for the Name of Heaven\u201d (Avot 2.12). For this aspect that dwells in the lower things, which we call Shekhinah, which is the Blessed Name \u201cLord,\u201d which is cloaked in every thing, is called \u201cName;\u201d and the Blessed Name YHWH is called \u201cHeaven,\u201d connoting clarity. And that is [the meaning of] \u201cfor the Name of Heaven,\u201d meaning to unite these two aspects as we have explained many times.  And that is [the meaning of] <i>Go yourself</i> as Rashi explained, \u201cFor your pleasure and your benefit.\u201d For it would seem difficult [to understand] \u2013 why would Blessed God open with [the idea that] he should do this on account of a turning toward his own pleasure and benefit? For even without this he certainly would have done Blessed God\u2019s will! But Blessed God teaches us how to serve [God], and said to him: <i>Go yourself</i>, meaning even a thing that you do for yourself, for your pleasure and benefit, in this you should also find a pathway to Blessed God, in that \u201cAll your deeds be for the Name of Heaven\u201d as mentioned above.\n"}}, "3": {"0": {"0": "<i>And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three [men were standing in front of him]. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the earth</i> (Gen. 18:1-2). It is written in the Holy Zohar, \u201cWho were these three men? Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\u201d (Zohar 1:98a). Now, it is known that the Holy Torah must be in every person and in every time, since it is eternal; but the truth is that the Blessed Creator is found in each Jew, and even in the most wicked person and in the worst sinner, God forbid. And the proof is that every wicked person has notions of teshuvah each day,  and that is [the meaning of] Blessed God\u2019s appearing to him.  And when he goes with this, when he elevates his mind, then he begins to ask, \u201cWhen will my actions arrive at the actions of my Ancestors?\u201d (cf. <i>Tanna D\u2019Vei Eliyahu Rabbah</i> [Friedmann ed.] ch. 23). For the Ancestors are themselves the chariot; and what is the chariot? It is written in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>, \u201cThe horse is secondary to the rider, but the rider is not secondary to the horse\u201d (Tikkun 70, 134a) such that the horse could go any place it wants, leading him into the river and to filthy places; instead, it must go to the place where the rider wills it to go. And when a person is a chariot for [God\u2019s] Great Name, he goes only to the place where Blessed God wants [him to go], he does only Blessed God\u2019s will and not the Evil Inclination\u2019s will.", "1": "And that is [the meaning of] <i>And the LORD appeared to him</i> written plain instead of being written \u201cto Abraham,\u201d for it applies to each Jew that Blessed God will appear to him. <i>By the oaks of Mamre</i>: <i>oaks</i> connote strength; <i>Mamre</i> connotes rebellion [<i>hamra\u2019ah</i>], meaning even in the strength of rebellion, when a person rebels [<i>mamre</i>] against Blessed God\u2019s word.  That is, even a very wicked person, God forbid \u2013 Blessed God appears to him, which are the notions of <i>teshuvah</i> that come to him as we have explained above. <i>As he sat at the door of his tent</i>, meaning that this opens a door for him in the heat of the day, when the passion of notions of teshuvah come to him. <i>He lifted up his eyes</i>, meaning that when he elevates his mind <i>and looked, and behold, three men [were standing in front of him]</i> \u2013 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which is to say that it is the level of the Ancestors, who were a chariot for [God\u2019s] Great Name. <i>When he saw them, he ran to meet them</i>, that he said, \u201cWhen will my actions arrive at the actions of my Ancestors?\u201d  And he also wants to arrive at this level, to be a chariot for Blessed [God], to go only to the place where Blessed [God] wants [him to go]. <i>From the tent door</i>, from that door which they opened for him as we have explained above. Then he <i>bowed</i> on his face: this bowing is a channeling [of divine energy], meaning he channels [divine energy] into the aspect of Earthliness \u2013 and understand this."}, "1": {"0": "In the Talmud of Shabbat (127a): Rav Yehudah quoted Rav: Welcoming guests is more important than receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, as it says, <i>do not pass by your servant</i> (Gen. 18:3).  Rabbi Elazar said: Come and see that the character of the Holy Blessed One is not like the character of flesh and blood \u2013 the character of flesh and blood, the lesser can not say to the greater, \u201cWait until I come to you;\u201d but regarding the Holy Blessed One, [Abraham] says, <i>do not pass by your servant</i> etc.", "1": "Now we must understand the language of the verse, do not pass by etc.  For it is impossible to say this about the Blessed Shekhinah since <i>all the earth is full of God\u2019s glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and no place is void of Him; and how could he say, <i>do not pass by</i> etc., which implies that place (as if it were possible) is not a place of God\u2019s glory, which is impossible. And, according to this, we must also understand the interpretation of Rav Yehudah, quoting Rav, who said, \u201cWelcoming guests is more important\u201d etc. \u2013 how can he prove from this verse that welcoming guests is more important?  Perhaps [Abraham acted this way] because in fulfilling the <i>mitzvah</i> of welcoming guests he will also receive the Face of the Shekhinah.  As is known, that is why they are called <i>mitzvot</i> \u2013 <i>mitzvah</i> on account of the Attachment with which the person attaches the Godly part that dwells within him to the collective Blessed Endless, from the terminology of Fellowship [<i>tzavvta</i>].  And if so, then it is possible that the <i>mitzvah</i> itself is not more important than receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, but only in [Abraham\u2019s] case there was also receiving the Face of the Shekhinah and he could fulfill both of them. And regarding the interpretation of Rabbi Elazar as well, who said, \u201cthe character of the Holy Blessed One is not like \u2026 the lesser can not say to the greater, \u2018Wait\u2026\u2019 but regarding Abraham\u201d etc., it is difficult as we have explained \u2013 in [Abraham\u2019s] case, was there not also receiving the Face of the Shekhinah [as well as welcoming guests]?  And specifically, since <i>tzaddikim</i> are called Faces of the Shekhinah because the Blessed Shekhinah dwells within them as is known from the Book of the Zohar, when he received the guests, i.e., angels who appeared like people, he was certainly receiving the Face of the Shekhinah.", "2": "But the truth is as follows: the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i> is primarily based on the aspect of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, which is the Attachment, from the terminology of Fellowship which is implied by the terminology of <i>mitzvah</i>.  Just as [the Sages] said in [Pirkei] Avot, \u201cThe reward of <i>mitzvah</i> is <i>mitzvah</i>\u201d (Mishnah, Avot 4.2), the essential reward from the <i>mitzvah</i> is the <i>mitzvah</i>, i.e., the Godly Attachment and the Spiritual Enjoyment that is in the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i> in the aspect of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah.  For without this, the <i>mitzvah</i> is called \u201cempty,\u201d meaning it is without life-force and soul, and is merely the body of the <i>mitzvah</i> as is known.  It is only called <i>mitzvah</i> through the Desire and Attachment of the Godly part that dwells within him to the Blessed Root along with all the parts of Israel, as is known.  For all Godly Service, whether in speech or action, has the aspect of Body and Soul, which gives life to that speech or action and without which it is without life-force.  And therefore \u201cthe wicked are called \u2018dead\u2019 in their lifetime\u201d (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 18b) because their actions are without life-force. But in truth the request made by Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, was this: <i>do not pass by</i> etc., because he was engaged in receiving the Face of the Shekhinah with certainty as is explicit in the verse <i>And the LORD appeared to him</i> (Gen. 18:1).  And at the moment he saw the guests he asked Blessed God that even when he went to fulfill [the <i>mitzvah</i> of] welcoming guests <i>do not pass by your servant</i>: let the <i>mitzvah</i> not be empty, God forbid, but may You be with me even there, so that I can fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> with Attachment, which is the aspect of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah. And the proof of Rav Yehudah\u2019s [interpretation], that welcoming guests is greater than receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, is that if welcoming guests were not greater, Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, certainly would not have set aside the certainty of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah and gone to welcome guests, which is in doubt [as to whether it will or will not include receiving the Face of the Shekhinah].  For [Abraham] needed to request, regarding [welcoming guests], that there would also be receiving the Face of the Shekhinah and Attachment to Blessed God.  And specifically it is known what our Sages of Blessed Memory said, \u201cThey appeared to him as Arabs\u201d (i.e., ordinary passersby; Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 32b), and so as far as he could tell they were not called \u201cFaces of the Shekhinah.\u201d  Rather, certainly the <i>mitzvah</i> itself is much greater, even if \u2013 God forbid \u2013 it would not include receiving the Face of the Shekhinah; but [Abraham] requested to do this <i>mitzvah</i> in complete wholeness, as he said, do not pass by etc., and understand this.", "3": "And this is also the meaning of the statement of Rabbi Elazar: \u201cthe character of the Holy Blessed One is not like the character of flesh and blood \u2013 the character of flesh and blood, the lesser can not say to the greater, \u2018Wait,\u2019\u201d because in a place where he walks away his honor is no longer there; if he is here, he can\u2019t be there.  But regarding the Holy Blessed One it is written, <i>all the earth is full of God\u2019s glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and therefore [Abraham] requested, <i>do not pass by</i> etc. because Blessed God\u2019s Glory is there also, and there too may I not be divided from my Attachment to You.  And [Abraham] could say this because he does not walk away from God no matter where he walks; his only request was not to be divided from Blessed God, because Blessed God is there, too, as He is here, and understand this."}}, "4": {"0": {"0": "<i>[Now Abraham was old, well advanced in days;] and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things</i> (Gen. 24:1), and it is stated in the Midrash, \u201cBy what merit?

For it is known that regarding the <i>mitzvah</i> of tithing it is said, <i>[Bring the full tithes into the storehouse\u2026] and thereby put me to the test, [says the LORD of hosts,] if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need</i> (Malakhi 3:10).", "1": "The meaning is that there are many channels of abundance through which the abundance travels by any means until it arrived below to the person. But the person\u2019s corruption below causes blockage in the channels; and that is how he comes, by way of his corruption, to the place of the judgments. The judgments stand and accuse and do not allow the life-force, the abundance, to travel to this person; and this is called \u201cblocking the channels.\u201d The virtue of tithing is to transcend the judgments and sweeten the judgments until the judgments consent to the influence of the blessing below, on account of their having been sweetened. And we must understand why this is: for it is known that \u201cIn the measure with which a man measures, so is he measured\u201d (Sotah 8b); however a person behaves below, in a certain characteristic,  so is it aroused above. If he arouses [in himself] the characteristic of compassion, the same is aroused above as well; and through this he causes sweetening of the judgment. But if, God forbid, the opposite, etc.", "2": "And therefore through tithing \u2013 which is <i>tzedakah</i> \u2013 this also causes compassion above on account of his arousing the characteristic of compassion below. And so it is for all the characteristics: a person must offer himself to the Good and imitate his Creator as our Sages of Blessed Memory said, \u201cJust as [God] is compassionate, etc.\u201d (Massekhet Soferim 3.13). Now, regarding Abraham it says, <i>Abraham was old, well advanced in days</i>, which is duplicative language. But it is known that the upper characteristics are called the \u201cthirteen arrangements of seniority;\u201d and that is the connotation of <i>old</i>, that he had arrived at all the \u201carrangements of seniority,\u201d which are called <i>old</i>. <i>In</i> upper <i>days</i>, he offered himself, with all the characteristics and days, to the upper Good \u2013 the place where there are no judgments at all. And that is [the meaning of] \u201cBy what merit:\u201d \u201cmerit\u201d [<i>z\u2019khut</i>] connotes success as in, \u201cI did not succeed [<i>zakhiti</i>] etc.\u201d (Mishnah, Berakhot 1.5). <i>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth [who does good and never sins]</i> (Ecclesiastes 7:20), but here it is written, <i>and the LORD</i>, \u201cHe and His house of judgment,\u201d  implying that [the judgments] consented to bless [Abraham]! And is it possible that there would not be a single judgment to obstruct the descending of abundance? So they taught, \u201cBy the merit of tithing\u201d as it is written, <i>And Abram gave him a tenth of everything</i> (Gen. 14:20); as is stated above, that this sweetened the judgments until they consented, \u201cHe and His house of judgment\u201d all together, to a complete blessing as we have explained."}}, "5": {"0": {"0": "In the verse, <i>Isaac's servants came</i> (Gen. 26:32): It is stated in the Midrash, \u201cWe do not know if they found water or not; when it says, <i>We have found water</i> (Gen. 26:32), we see they found water\u201d (Genesis Rabbah 64.10).", "1": "To understand this matter we will begin with the verse, <i>they have forsaken me, the source of living waters</i> (Jeremiah 2:13). Its meaning is that Blessed God is the source from whom comes the flow of life-force to all living things in all manners, <i>there is no other besides [God]</i> (Deut. 4:35); and anyone who is attached to [God] is attached to the root of life-force <i>whose waters do not fail</i> (Isaiah 58:11) \u2013 but only so long as there is no blockage from his side. For if, God forbid, on account of his sins he blocks himself from the source, his life-force will become absent; but from Blessed [God\u2019s] side there is no blockage as the verse says, <i>but your iniquities have made a separation [between you and your God]</i> (Isaiah 59:2). But one whose life-force is from the Other Side, who are called <i>broken cisterns</i> (Jeremiah 2:13) since they are gathered waters into which fell sparks of life-force at the moment of breaking, and for this reason they are called <i>broken cisterns</i> \u2013 such a person is blocked from his Upper Root and is called <i>separator of close friends</i> (Proverbs 16:28, 17:9).  And therefore the Ancestors of the World, who opened the pipelines of intelligence in the world and taught awareness to all people, how to dig himself into the aspect of <i>a well of living water</i> (Gen. 26:19), to be attached to the source from which comes the root of his life-force. And [the Ancestors\u2019] disciples are called by the name \u201cservants,\u201d as the verse says, <i>Isaac\u2019s servants</i> (Gen. 26:32), since their service of the Blessed Creator came by way of the Ancestors.", "2": "But after Abraham\u2019s death, these springs of wisdom were stopped up, because they <i>were stopped by the Philistines</i> (Gen. 26:18) who are the aspect of evil which is set in a person, who had overpowered the world; and the element of Earth had overpowered [the others] and in proportion the spiritual and intellectual powers weakened. But when Isaac, his son, came and held to his father\u2019s path, he taught this awareness to the people of his generation as well \u2013 to return and dig to the aspect of a well of living water through many types of intelligences and great and concealed counsels \u2013 until <i>Isaac dug again the wells of water</i> (Gen. 26:18). All this comes by way of faith, which is the precursor to this: that one believes with complete faith that Blessed God, <i>the whole earth is filled with [God\u2019s] Glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and no place is void of [God], <i>there is no other besides [God]</i> (Deut. 4:35). And then, by way of this faith, he yearns for [God] and desires to hold to and attach himself to Blessed God, who has the aspect of <i>valley</i> [<i>nahal</i>] (Gen. 26:19), which is an acronym for <i>Our soul waits for the LORD</i> [<i>nafsheynu hiktah la-ADONAI</i>] (Psalm 33:20), which [means] by way of faith. And then, through this, he comes to his root, which is the spring of the <i>well of living waters</i> that we have described. And that is [the meaning of] <i>when Isaac's servants dug in the valley</i> (Gen. 26:19) \u2013 the aspect of <i>valley</i> as we have stated \u2013 <i>and found there a well of living water</i> (Gen. 26:19), etc., <i>The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled \u2026 so he called the name of the well Esek</i> etc. (Gen. 26:20), <i>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah</i> (Gen. 26:21), <i>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, \u201cFor now [the LORD has made room for us]\u201d</i> etc. (Gen. 26:22).", "3": "And now I must give awareness, education, and understanding regarding the matter of the three wells and their names, for the Ancestors looked through their great mind\u2019s eye to the end of all the generations, with the tribulations that would befall them. It is known that during the time that the Temple stood there was an expansion of true awareness, how to draw close to the boundary in order to attach themselves to the aspect of <i>a well of living water</i>, more and more than in a time of exile; and even the Nations of the World would recognize a slight recognition, and would bring sacrifices as is written in the prayer of King Solomon, peace be upon him, <i>And when the foreigner shall come</i> etc. (1 Kings 8:41),  and as we find that even just before the Destruction the Caesar sent them a sacrifice, as is known (cf. Gittin 55b-56a). However, even in the time of the Temple the aspect of Good and Evil was still in the world, until on account of Israel\u2019s sins Evil overpowered [Good] and the Temple was destroyed. And therefore the aspect of the well was called <i>Esek</i>. And afterward <i>they dug another well</i> (Gen. 26:21), which is the Second Temple of Ezra\u2019s days, when this awareness again expanded until they knew how to dig to the aspect of \u201cwell.\u201d <i>And they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah</i> (Gen. 26:21) on account of the Satan\u2019s accusation, for the power of materiality had overcome the awareness until <i>he moved from there</i> (Gen. 26:22) in the aspect of the passage of time,  which is the lengthy exile, <i>and dug another well<i> (Gen. 26:22), which is the coming of our Righteous Messiah, speedily in our days, when there will be no Evil accusation at all as is written, <i>I will remove from the land \u2026 the spirit of uncleanness<i> (Zechariah 13:2), for then the world will be entirely Good. <i>So he called its name Rehoboth</i> (Gen. 26:22), for then will be expansion of awareness as the verse says, <i>for the earth shall be full of awareness of the LORD<i> (Isaiah 11:9). And we will merit to attach to the light of Blessed Infinity, to comprehend Blessed [God\u2019s] Nature and to attach to Blessed God with eternal attachment. And that is [the meaning of] what is written after this, <i>From there he went up to Beersheba<i> (Gen. 26:23); for the Shekhinah is called \u201cBeersheba,\u201d we will merit to be on a high level, and understand this.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i>", "4": "However, every person must strengthen himself even in the times when Evil obstructs him and does not allow him to rise up to the aspect of \u201cwell;\u201d nevertheless he should see through his mind\u2019s eye that even in that place is a contraction of Blessed [God\u2019s] Divinity, as we have said in a different place. And he should look at the obstruction and understand from it what is the root of his life-force, from which characteristic it is, whether from the aspect of Mercy [<i><u>h</u>esed</i>] or Strength [<i>gevurah</i>]. And he should see to bring it to its root, for through this characteristic, which he arouses to bring it close, through it he begins to serve the Blessed Creator, whether in thought or in word or in deed;  for these characteristics are Divinity, but they fell from their place in the breaking. And then Good will be made out of them as well. And similarly, if obstructions come to him from the side of judgments \u2013 coming to him from his root Above, the characteristic of Strength [<i>gevurah</i>], which is the characteristic of Isaac \u2013 he should understand through his awareness that these judgments are from the Upper Holy Place, except that they fell through the descent of the levels to the place of judgments, which is the place of <i>broken cisterns</i> (Jeremiah 2:13). And he should hold to the characteristic of Strength [<i>gevurah</i>], to revere Blessed God and to serve Blessed God immediately through this [characteristic], and to bring them to their roots and sweeten the judgments. For this is the secret: the judgments can only be sweetened at their roots, which is the characteristic of Isaac. For immediately when, through these judgments that came on account of his sins, he strengthens himself and serves with them at the root of their hold until they arrive at their root; for in that place is only absolute Divinity, the judgments are nullified and sweetened."}}, "6": {"0": {"0": "<i>Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran</i> (Gen. 28:10).

But when this aspect in which he [resided] leaves him, then certainly <i>the tzaddik will hold his path</i> (Job 17:9) to attach to his root.

For that is the nature of Holiness: that even after it leaves an imprint remains behind, as our Sages of Blessed memory said, \u201cThe Shekhinah has never moved from the Western Wall\u201d (Exodus Rabbah 2.2).

And based on our way we should pay attention to read precisely the word these in [God\u2019s] statement, <i>that I may show these signs of mine among them</i> (Ex. 9:1) \u2013 it is as if [God] points with a finger at the signs, that here they are before [Moses\u2019] eyes; but in truth they were not visible to his eyes. However, the point of the Exodus from Egypt was that Awareness was in exile with Pharaoh; and that meant that the nation, although they were the Children of Israel, did not know God even though they had a tradition from the mouth of their holy ancestors, the fathers of the world. Nevertheless, since they were the fourth generation they had forgotten the true Awareness about which King David, peace be upon him, said to his son Solomon, <i>know the God of your father</i> (1 Chron. 28:9). And that is the essence of the exile, that Awareness was in exile in Egypt. And therefore wicked Pharaoh said <i>Who is the LORD?</i> etc. (Ex. 5:2), that he denied the essential principle and believed only in sorcery. For he was a great sorcerer and did not know God or that it is written, \u201c<i>there is none but [God]</i> (Deut. 4:35), even sorcery,\u201d \u201cwhich contradicts the power of Heaven\u201d (Sanhedrin 67b);  they have no ability to act beyond Blessed God\u2019s will, as is explained in the Talmud in the incident of Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa.

That is to say, it was with [Pharaoh] in exile, and through this combination the word \u201c<i>Elohim</i>\u201d will be in wholeness and, and it will be known that <i>the LORD is God</i>, [God] is powerful and master of ability, and <i>there is none but [God]</i>, even sorcery as we have stated.", "1": "And through this we can explain the commentators\u2019 question mentioned above.

And how should a person choose good from evil, if not through Awareness? When a person has the Awareness to distinguish between good and evil, then he can choose good and despise evil. Now, in the Egyptian exile the Awareness was in exile, as we have stated, and then they did not have the full choice, with full awareness. For this is the essence of the Exodus from Egypt, that the Awareness should come out of exile and there can be Choice with Awareness \u2013 which is not the case in exile, when Awareness was with [Pharaoh] in Egypt. Then, even Choice could not be; in which case Choice was not taken from Pharaoh at all, since Choice [itself] did not yet exist, as we have explained. For it came into being afterward, in their Exodus from Egypt, when the Awareness came out of exile \u2013 then Choice had something on which to take effect, as we have stated.", "2": "And with this, we can further clarify Maimonides\u2019 question (Laws of Repentance 5.5), which is explained in <i>Zohar <u>H</u>adash</i> (Tikkunim 98a) in the name of the Ancient Ones, regarding the matter of Choice \u2013 which was given freely to Adam \u2013 and Blessed God\u2019s knowledge: how can the two of them be as one?", "3": "However, when we said that the essence of Choice is Awareness \u2013 that when a person knows God with whole Awareness, then Choice is relevant, whereas without Awareness Choice has no relevance \u2013 and if that is the case, Choice and Knowledge are one; for with what should a person choose, if not Awareness? And God\u2019s Awareness is Choice; if so, this is the essence of the Blessed Creator\u2019s Knowledge: that [God] Knows the Choice, and they are not contradictory but they are all one as we have explained, and understand this.", "4": "Indeed, regarding what is explained in the Talmud, \u201cA person does not commit a sin unless a spirit of nonsense has entered him\u201d (Sotah 3a), relates to another matter. For is it not known what is stated in the verse, <i>the tzaddik shall live through his faith</i> (Habakuk 2:4)? For sometimes a person falls from Awareness, and it is by way of a trial from the Blessed Creator, by taking from him the Awareness in order to see if he will stand by God\u2019s ways. Nevertheless <i>the righteous holds to his way</i> through his faith; and even though they take the Awareness from him, nevertheless he walks and strengthens himself in God\u2019s ways. But this is not true if he does not have the faith; then when he falls from Awareness and \u201ca spirit of nonsense enters him\u201d he might commit a sin, God forbid. And this is what our Sages of Blessed Memory intended in their saying, \u201cA person does not commit a sin unless a spirit of nonsense has entered him,\u201d which is to say that he fell from Awareness by way of a trial. But in the Egyptian exile they did not have Awareness at all, and then there was no relevance for Choice as we have stated. And that is because the Awareness was in smallness, which is to say that they were in Awareness like a minor who has no [legal] awareness; and therefore it was stated in the Talmud, \u201cA minor has no [legal] intention\u201d (Hullin 13a). And that is [the meaning of] the verse\u2019s further statement, <i>that you may tell \u2026 how I have toyed</i> [<i>hit\u2019allalti</i>] <i>with the Egyptians</i> (Ex. 10:2), from the idiom of <i>child</i> [<i>ollel</i>] <i>and infant</i> (Jeremiah 44:7) \u2013 as if [God was saying] \u201cLike I have made myself small in Egypt,\u201d which is to say that the Awareness was in smallness in Egypt. And after this it says <i>that you may know that I am the LORD</i> (Ex. 10:2), which is to say that they will have the whole Awareness in their Exodus from Egypt, to know God with Awareness."}, "1": {"0": "[Regarding] the statement in the Holy Zohar, \u201c<i>Come to Pharaoh</i> (Ex. 10:1) \u2013 it should have said \u2018<b>go</b> to Pharaoh!\u2019\u201d (cf. Zohar Bo, 2:34a), as well as the question posed by the commentators, which I wrote above \u2013 the miracle of the Exodus from Egypt was that the Awareness was in exile with wicked Pharaoh in Egypt; and therefore Israel was exiled there to bring the Awareness from there. And the difficulty of the servitude made it whole, as is stated in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>: \u201c<i>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve\u2026 in mortar</i> [<i>be-<u>h</u>omer</i>] (Ex. 1:13-14), that is [the logical argument of] \u2018\u2026and certainly\u2026\u2019 [<i>kal ve-homer</i>]; <i>and in brick</i> [<i>oo-vil\u2019venim</i>] (Ex. 1:14), that is the heating [<i>libbun</i>] of halakhah; <i>and in all manner of service in the field</i> (Ex. 1:14), that is the external sources; <i>in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor</i> [<i>b\u2019farekh</i>] (Ex. 1:14), <i>that is argumentation</i> [<i>pirkha</i>]\u201d (Tikkun 9, Supplement 147a), which is to say that all of this was in exile in Egypt. And through their servitude they took the Awareness, which is the Torah, out of the exile. When they served <i>in mortar</i> they brought [the logical argument of] \u201c\u2026and certainly\u2026\u201d out of the exile, and so on for all the other servitudes as we have stated. And therefore when Moses our Teacher, peace be upon him, said, <i>Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me [ \u2013 How then shall Pharaoh listen to me]</i> (Ex. 6:12), and Rashi explained, \u201cThis is one of ten \u2018\u2026and certainly\u2026\u2019 [arguments] in the Torah,\u201d that is to say that when [Moses] said this \u201c\u2026and certainly\u2026\u201d [argument] he brought the \u201c\u2026and certainly\u2026\u201d [argument] in the Torah out of the exile.

Because [if that were the case] the world would not be able to exist for even one hour, and would be nullified from existence because of the letter <i>aleph</i>\u2019s great brightness, since it alludes to the Champion [<i>aluf</i>] of the World, who is Blessed God in [God\u2019s] Glory and [God\u2019s] Essence, as if it were possible. But <i>because the LORD God is a sun and shield</i> (Psalm 84:12) \u2013 which is to say just like one can not look at the sun because of its great brightness, only by way of a shade or a shield can one look at the sun\u2019s light \u2013 so too, as if it were possible, with a thousand thousands of thousands of distinctions without end or boundary, would it be impossible to exist because of the letter <i>aleph</i>\u2019s great brightness, since it is the Champion of the World. Only by way of a shade or a shield, which is the letter <i>bet</i> \u2013 [only] through it does it become possible to constrain the letter <i>aleph</i> so that it can also be in the Torah. For after the letter <i>bet</i> in <i>bereshit</i> we find several <i>aleph</i>s, in the word <i>bereshit</i> and in the words <i>bara elohim</i>, once it was constrained by the letter bet.", "2": "And that is [the meaning of] <i>Come</i> [\u05d1\u05d0] <i>to Pharaoh</i>, which is to say through the <i>bet</i> the <i>aleph</i> will be in the Torah. And since now the Torah is in exile, therefore <i>I have hardened his heart and [the heart of his servants]</i> (Ex. 10:1) so that Israel will serve <i>in mortar and in brick</i> (Ex. 1:14) to bring the Torah out of exile. And as is stated in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>, \u201c<i>\u2026 in mortar</i> [<i>be-<u>h</u>omer</i>] (Ex. 1:13-14), that is [the logical argument of] \u2018\u2026and certainly\u2026\u2019 [<i>kal ve-<u>h</u>omer</i>],\u201d as we said above \u2013 through this they brought [the argument of] \u201c\u2026and certainly\u2026\u201d out of the exile, and so on for the other servitudes. And that is [the meaning of] <i>that I may show these signs</i> [<i>otot</i>] <i>of mine among them</i> (Ex. 10:1), that the letters [<i>otiot</i>], which belong to the Torah, must be taken out of exile. And the verse concludes, <i>that you may tell \u2026 how I have toyed</i> (Ex. 10:2), which is to say that I made Myself small since the Awareness was in smallness.  And now <i>you may know</i> (Ex. 10:2), as was stated above."}}, "10": {"0": {"0": "<i>Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, [and the people shall go out] and gather a day's portion every day</i> (Ex. 16:4). Now, the Torah is eternal since \u201cTorah and the Holy Blessed One are one\u201d (Zohar 1:24a), and it needs to be limitless in past, present, and future; but how is this relevant to every person and every time?", "1": "The matter is that when Israel was in Egypt, the iron furnace, they were so clarified that after fifty days they were able to receive the Torah because of their bodies\u2019 clarification. And because of this the Sea of Reeds needed to split for them so they could walk through the sea; this needed to be the order so that they could clarify more and more to the point that afterward, at the Giving of the Torah, our Sages of Blessed Memory said that their impurity ceased (Shabbat 146a). And they continued clarifying in this way, that the materiality continually diminished to the point that after the splitting of the Sea of Reeds they had clarified so much to the extent that they could receive Upper Life-Force without any garment, because of the clarification of their physical materiality. For the abundance flows from above according to the thickness or thinness of the recipient. And the life-force that comes from above is drawn by way of the speech that is fixed in a person\u2019s mouth, as is known. Therefore immediately after the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, the passage of manna is stated, <i>and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day</i>, that each person received Upper Life-Force without any garment, just <i>Man eating the bread of the angels</i> (Psalm 78:25). And by way of what will it be drawn? <i>A day's portion</i> [<i>davar</i>] <i>every day</i>, which is to say by way of the words [<i>dibburim</i>] that they speak from day to day in words of Truth and Torah, until after they have returned to their materiality and their physicality has thickened \u2013 therefore the flow descends from above garbed in several garments according to the power of the recipients. And if so, even today in the present there is the aspect of \u201cmanna,\u201d but it comes by way of garments; for each person, his life-force is garbed in a vessel, each person according to his aspect, meaning the thing from which his sustenance comes. And <i>the wise person has his eyes in his head</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:14) to understand that the Blessed Creator\u2019s life-force is what is garbed in that thing, and [God] has contracted [God\u2019s] self in that thing, and it is merely a vessel for the Upper Life-Force.", "2": "Therefore Blessed God said to Moses, <i>Take a jar, and put [an omer of manna in it,] and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations</i> (Ex. 16:33), which is to say that since in the coming generations their physicality will thicken until they can only receive the life-force through a vessel \u2013 it needs to garb itself in the material vessel according to the recipients. And that is [the meaning of] <i>Take a jar</i>, which is to say a vessel, <i>and put an omer of manna in it</i>,  which is to say manna, the life-force, is garbed within the vessel, which is the jar. And similarly today there is also the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, and afterward the manna comes; for every day we recite the Song of the Sea, and one must imagine in his awareness as if he is reciting the Song at the Sea as in that time. And then it will truly cause the aspect of the splitting of the Sea of Reeds above, as is known, when he recites it with whole intention as is stated regarding this in the Holy Zohar. And afterward he receives life-force as we have said, each according to his aspect. Therefore the <i>Shul<u>h</u>an Arukh</i> wrote, \u201cIt is good to recite the passage of Manna\u201d each day (<i>Orah <u>H</u>ayyim</i> 1.5), so that he will know that his sustenance comes from Upper Supervision, and understand this."}}, "11": {"0": {"0": "\u201cAt the moment when Israel put <i>we will do</i> before <i>we will listen</i>, a heavenly voice came out and said: \u2018Who revealed this secret to my children, the language the ministering angels use?\u2019\u201d etc. (Shabbat 88a).", "1": "Now, it is known that there is a world of pleasure, the world of Understanding; and when one speaks the speakings with joy and passion, with Love and Reverence, the pleasure comes to him afterward.

And contained in this are secrets of Torah, the reason why it is necessary to fall from his level; and one reason is so that he can arrive afterward at an even greater level, for in every thing there must be Absence before Presence.  When we want to rise to an even greater level there must be absence beforehand, therefore one must fall from the level at which one currently stands.

And this is [the meaning of the verse] <i>From the rising of the sun until it goes down [the LORD\u2019s name is to be praised]</i> (Psalm 113:3), for the <i>tzaddik</i> is called \u201cthe sun\u201d as in the teaching, \u201cBefore Eli\u2019s sun set, the sun of Samuel the Ramatite had risen etc.\u201d (Yoma 38b),  thus a <i>tzaddik</i> is called the sun.  And this is [the meaning of] <i>From the rising of the sun</i>, which is when one\u2019s mind is clear and pure and attached to Blessed God, <i>until it goes down</i>, which is when the clarity departs and he falls from his level.

And this is the essence of receiving the Torah that Israel received, and therefore Blessed God greatly praised them for this: that they accepted the Torah in the fullness of Truth and comprehended Truth, that they would forever be attached to Blessed God and would not separate from God even when they fell from their level. This is the essence of the Jewish journey and conduct, and this is how a person must walk.  And how can a person come to Blessed God once he has fallen from his level, since his mind-states and Awareness have been taken from him?  But Blessed God, <i>all the earth is full of God\u2019s glory</i>, that is, even in a place that is <i>all the earth</i>, which is entirely materialistic, which is only dense matter, nevertheless it is full of God\u2019s Blessed Glory.

For when a person was in his mother\u2019s belly, God\u2019s \u201ccandle burned over his head, and he saw from one end of the world to the other\u2026 and they taught him the entire Torah\u201d (Niddah 30b); for he was a dwelling-place [<i>mishkan</i>] for Blessed God, and this is [the meaning of] the candle that was over his head.  But after he came out of his mother\u2019s belly sin crouches at the door (Gen. 4:7), and an angel comes and slaps him on the mouth and makes him forget so that he will have free will, so he will have reward and punishment.

Now, the essence of <i>teshuvah</i> is abandoning sin with a full heart and regret.  For what is written in the Books, that fasts correct sin, is because it is impossible for him truly to abandon the sin and truly regret until after he has afflicted himself; and then his uncircumcised heart will surrender and he will be able to regret and abandon the sin truly.

But the matter is according to what is written, <i>When God began to create</i> etc. (Gen. 1:1), and our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted: \u201cFor the sake of Torah and for the sake of Israel\u201d (cf. Rashi, ad. loc.); so we find that Israel is something very important to Blessed God, since for their sake all of the Worlds and all the Creations were created.  And Blessed God takes pleasure from each one of Israel, even from a greatly wicked person: \u201c<i>Your temples</i> [<i>rakatekh</i>] <i>are like a pomegranate</i> (Song of Songs 6:7) \u2013 even the empty ones [<i>reykanim</i>] among you are as full of <i>mitzvot</i> as a pomegranate\u201d (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 57a).

But we must be precise: what connection does idolatry have to evil speech?  But the matter is according to what is written, <i>By the word of ADONAI were the heavens made</i> (Psalm 33:6), that all of the Worlds and all of the Creations were created through speech comprised of the 22 letters of the Torah, which is called Heavenly Sovereignty.  For when the Sovereign does not speak, no one knows how to do His Will; and when he speaks His Will is revealed, and that is Heavenly Sovereignty whose Sovereignty is in all jurisdictions.  And we find in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> that [the letters] are established in the mouth, that Blessed God established the 22 letters: the World of Speech, Heavenly Sovereignty, the Attribute of ADONAI-ness, <i>ADONAI, open my lips<i> (Psalm 51:17), were established in the human mouth.</i></i>", "So it is that Blessed God does not speak evil about Israel like the father does not speak [evil] about his son; so we find that when a person speaks evil he presents himself as someone who deny that his words are Heavenly Sovereignty, the Attribute of ADONAI-ness, and therefore he is like one who worships idolatry.  And this is the statement of King David, peace be upon him, <i>[May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks proud things!] Who have said: \u201cOur tongue will we make mighty\u201d</i> (Psalm 12:5), which is to say that the wicked say \u201cLet us make our tongues mighty to speak because our lips are ours, who is a Lord over us?\u201d  Which is to say they deny that the ADONAI-ness is in their mouths.  But one must have faith that his speech is Heavenly Sovereignty; and this is the statement of [our Sages] of Blessed Memory, \u201cWho rules over me? The <i>tzaddik</i>!\u201d (Babylonian Talmud, Moed Katan 16b), which is to say \u201cThe <i>tzaddik</i> rules with me, with My speech, which is Heavenly Sovereignty, ruling over all the Worlds and all the Creations.\u201d  And how do we arrive at this faith?  It is through engaging in the Torah, meaning when a person speaks words of Torah and connects his speech to the letters of the Torah, through that he brings about Heavenly Sovereignty.", "So it is that we find a disagreement in [Babylonian Talmud] Arakhin 15b, \u201cOne says that a person who told [evil speech] has no remedy, and one said he should engage in Torah as is stated, <i>the Tree of Life heals the tongue</i> (Proverbs 15:4).\u201d  And yet they certainly do not disagree, for this is a principle in all of Torah: \u201cThese and these are the words of the Living God\u201d (Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 14a), so too here when a person engages in Torah not for its own sake he has no remedy, but when he engages [in Torah] for its own sake and connects his speech to the letters of the Torah he thereby brings about Heavenly Sovereignty; and this is [the meaning of] <i>the Tree of Life heals the tongue</i>.", "And this is [the meaning of] <i>This shall be the Torah concerning the one struck with skin blanch</i> [<i>metzora</i>], which is to say the Torah and learning of the one who speaks evil [<i>motzi ra</i>] <i>on the day he becomes clean</i> will be in order to elevate and connect his speech, which is Heavenly Sovereignty, called <i>this</i>, to connect with the Torah; and then <i>He shall be brought to the priest</i>, which is to say to Blessed God who is called \u201cPriest.\u201d"], "14": ["<i>And Adonai spoke to Moses, saying: \u201cLift up the head of the children of Gershon, them as well, by their fathers\u2019 house [by their families]</i> etc. (Num.\u00a04:21-22).  And we must understand what is meant by <i>saying</i>: it presents no problem with respect to <i>mitzvot</i>, since it makes sense to say that the explanation is that Moses should <i>say</i> to Israel; but here, [God\u2019s instruction] is for Moses alone!  And furthermore the Torah is eternal and relevant in every time, for otherwise it would be, God forbid, merely stories from past times; and if that were the case why would it be called \u201cTorah\u201d which connotes Instruction and Guidance [<i>hora\u2019at derekh</i>], since it instructs [<i>morah</i>] and teaches us the way of God \u2014 but what Instruction and Guidance is here?", "But it is written, <i>attach to Him</i> (Deut.\u00a011:22), which our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted: \u201cHow is it possible to attach to Blessed God, when He is a Consuming Fire?\u201d and it is written in the Holy Zohar, \u201cA Fire which consumes all the fires in the world\u201d (III:62a); and if so, how is it possible for Flesh and Blood to attach to such a God?  Rather, [the verse means] attach to God\u2019s attributes: just as He is merciful, so you should be merciful, etc. (cf.\u00a0Rashi,\u00a0loc.\u00a0cit.).  And we must understand: How does this answer his question?  While it is true that a person could attach to God\u2019s attributes, in the verse it says, <i>attach to <b>Him</b></i>!  But in truth the answer is that Blessed God gave us the Torah so a person would be able to attach to Blessed God; for how [else] would it be possible for a person who is bounded and limited to attach to Blessed God, who is without limit, since He has no beginning and no end?  Therefore Blessed God gave us the Torah and contracted himself (as if it were possible) into our Holy Torah so that in his  attaching to the Torah, it happens that he is attached to Blessed God who dwells within the Torah.  And this is the statement of our Sages of Blessed Memory, \u201cAttach to God\u2019s attributes,\u201d meaning to the Torah; for the Torah is interpreted through thirteen [methodological] attributes, such as \u201cfrom one premise to another,\u201d \u201cfrom a similar phrase,\u201d etc.,1 and these are precisely the thirteen attributes [of God], \u201cmerciful and compassionate\u201d etc.  So when a person attaches to the Torah he attaches to Blessed God who dwells within the Torah.", "And so according to this it would be very easy for a person to attach to Blessed God, meaning through his attaching to the letters of the Torah and Prayer which are the Capabilities of the Blessed Creator who dwells within them; but there are Foreign Thoughts which come and confuse him at the time when he is engaged in Torah and Prayer.  So what can one do about this?  One must ask the advice of the Torah, since the Torah gives us advice about this.  For a person must understand the matter of the Foreign Thoughts: are they not Letters which have fallen?  For no thought could exist without Letters, and the Foreign Thoughts are also Letters, but they have fallen because of his own actions.  And therefore when he comes to attach to Blessed God, they also come so that he can elevate them.  But a Foreign Thought does not come, God forbid, to confuse him, and he must elevate them to their Root.", "And this is what the Torah tells us in pleasant words: <i>Lift up the head</i>, which is to say that your should lift up and elevate \u05d0\"\u05ea, which are the twenty-two letters from <i>aleph</i> to <i>tav</i>; elevate them to the Head and the First who is the Blessed Creator.  For all the words of the Torah and Prayer, they are all combinations of Letters: when you join together <i>vav-yud-dalet-bet-resh</i> it makes the word <i>vayedaber</i>; all the words are all combinations of Letters and one must elevate the Letters to their Roots.  And if you do this then <i>the children of Gershon</i>, the Letters which fell and were banished [<i>nitgarshu</i>], <i>they too</i> will rise <i>to their fathers\u2019 house</i>, they being Abraham who was the attribute of Mercy and Love; and the Fear of Isaac, who was the attribute of Reverence; and <i>Israel, in whom I will be glorified</i> (Isaiah\u00a049:3) who was the attribute of Glory.  That is, when a person leans and prays with Reverence and Love in order to Glorify his Creator by the Name of His Glorious Sovereignty, then the Letters go up there Above to the Fathers as has been explained.  <i>To their families</i>, to their Attachments as in <i>put me, please</i> (1\u00a0Sam.\u00a02:36).  But how does one do all this?  King Solomon, peace be upon him, explained it as <i>Whatever your hand is capable of doing</i> (Ecclesiastes\u00a09:10) which is to say in whatever way you want to do Blessed God\u2019s Will, do it with strength, you must <i>do it with strength</i>; meaning that when you put all your strength and your life-force into the Letters of the Torah and Prayer, through this you will elevate them to their Root, to the Blessed Creator."], "15": ["<i>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, \u201cPinhas the son of Eleazar\u2026 [has settled my wrath\u2026] Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace\u201d</i> (Num. 25:10-12), and the Sages of Blessed Memory, in the Talmud (Zevachim 101b) interpreted that Pinhas only became a priest after he had killed Zimri.  We must understand the phrasing of <i>saying</i>, which must be to Israel since the statement to Pinhas is stated explicitly in the verse, <i>Therefore say (to him), \u2018Behold, I give to him\u2019</i> etc. \u2013 but what was the statement to Israel? We must also understand the phrasing of <i>settled</i> rather than saying \u201cremoved\u201d <i>my wrath<i> etc.</i></i>", "\u2026", "To understand the matter further, we will precede it with the <i>mishnah</i> from <i>Pirkei Avot 5:1</i>: \u201cThe world was created through ten statements, and what does that mean to teach\u2026 except to collect from the wicked etc.\u201d  We must understand the fact that the world was created through ten statements in order to augment the punishment of the wicked, who destroy a world as great as this that was created through ten statements \u2013 which makes no sense since the world could have been created through a single statement; it is inconceivable that the Blessed Creator, who is a faithful God without wrongdoing, would create us through ten statements in order to augment the punishment of the wicked.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "But through this you can understand what they said, \u201c<i>The tzaddik rules [through] reverence for God</i> (2 Sam. 23:3) \u2026 [I rule over humans, but] who rules over Me? The <i>tzaddik</i>, [for I make a decree but he annuls it]\u201d (Moed Katan 16b). For at the hands of the wicked the world collapses and remains in contraction and judgment, God forbid; but at the hands of the <i>tzaddikim</i> the king\u2019s anger is settled, as if it were possible. This can be compared to the child of a king, who when he enters into his father\u2019s [presence] \u2013 even at the time of his anger \u2013 since the king\u2019s will is to draw very close to his precious child, the characteristic of love is awakened within [the king] toward his child; and then that characteristic expands to all those who are in the king\u2019s gate as well. So it is at the hands of the <i>tzaddikim</i>, who bring themselves closer \u2013 along with all things \u2013 to their Father in Heaven, giving [God] a restful spirit: [God\u2019s] mind settles, as if it were possible, and the judgments that were awakened at the hands of the wicked are sweetened. And that is [the meaning of] \u201cto collect from the wicked, who destroy [a world created] through ten statements\u201d \u2013 for even though the Creation happened through ten statements for their benefit, in order that even there in their lowly place they should be able to hold onto [God\u2019s] characteristics, and similarly [God\u2019s] characteristics and divinity were contracted for them in order that they should recognize [God\u2019s characteristics], as was stated above \u2013 and even still, on the contrary, on account of [all] this they distance themselves further. \u201cAnd to give good reward to the <i>tzaddikim</i>, who sustain a world created through ten statements\u201d \u2013 as we have stated above, by way of [the world] being created through ten statements, through contraction; for without this it would not have been possible, and understand this.", "\u2026", "Now, through the act of Zimri at Shittim, Israel began to whore after the daughters of Moab; and they seized the Blessed Creator\u2019s characteristic, the characteristic of love, and through this distanced themselves from Blessed [God] \u2013 whereas on the contrary, through this they could have drawn themselves closer. But they remained in contraction, a place where the Upper Love was contracted, and they drew it down to a place of the judgments and the contraction; and therefore the punishment, God save us, came upon them, wherein twenty-four thousand Israelites died. But Pinhas, on account of his holding onto the Omnipresent\u2019s zealousness, upheld and established the characteristic of mercy [<i>hesed</i>],  which the wicked had cast down; and therefore he deserved to be a priest. And that is [the meaning of] <i>settled my wrath</i> \u2013 from the idiom of <i>settling the soul</i> (Psalm 19:8), [meaning] that Pinhas settled [God\u2019s] spirit, as if it were possible, as we have stated above, through the beloved child at whose hands the judgments are sweetened and absorbed into mercy. And therefore <i>it shall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a perpetual priesthood</i> (Num 25:13), and therefore Pinhas only became a priest after he killed Zimri, for then he held onto and established the characteristic of mercy; and understand this, blessed is God forever, amen and amen."], "16": ["<i>When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof</i> etc. (Deut. 22:8).  Now, it is stated in the Talmud of [Tractate] Gittin (7a): \u201cHe sent to Mar Ookva, \u2018People are attacking...\u2019 he drew lines and wrote to him, \u2018<i>Be still before the LORD</i> and he will cast them down before you like so many corpses.\u2019\u201d", "The meaning is that when people sometimes afflict a certain person, it is because of the judgments against him Above; and [the judgments] clothe themselves in people Below to afflict him as is said about the verse, <i>The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall see through those who hate me</i> (Ps. 118:7).  The explanation: the fact that the judgments clothe themselves Below in people is helpful, since through this he can see what is also the case Above; which is to say, <i>I shall see</i> Above <i>through those who hate me</i>, meaning through the haters below. And the correction for this is to raise himself to the aspect of the world of Thought.  For there [in the world of Thought] are no judgments, as is written, <i>evil may not dwell with you</i> (Ps. 5:5).  And that means that through his remaining silent and accepting what comes to him, <i>waiting quietly</i> (Lam. 3:26) and elevating his thoughts as is written, <i>Be still before the LORD</i> etc.  The explanation is that a person should elevate the silence, meaning the thought, to the LORD; and then they will fall like corpses, meaning the judgments will fall through the attachment of his thoughts to the LORD. And just as the roof is the essence of the house, similarly Thought is the essence of a person and shelters over him.  For through Thought a person is preserved and knows how to settle himself as is known; and therefore Thought is called a \u201croof.\u201d", "Now, when a person builds a house it arouses the judgments, particularly outside the Land [of Israel] where it is full of all the emptiness  of the world, as is known, and it constricts their borders.  Therefore the Torah said, <i>When you build a new house, you shall make</i>, which is the idiom of correction, <i>a parapet</i> [<i>ma\u2019akeh</i>] from the idiom of irritations [<i>me\u2019ikim</i>]; the things that irritate you will be corrected through your attaching yourself Above to the place of Thought, which is your \u201croof\u201d as we have said.  And then, if you attach your Thought to the Blessed Creator, then <i>when the one who falls will fall</i> (Deut. 22:8) \u2013 as our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted, he was destined to fall \u2013 for the judgments were destined to fall since the six days of Creation as is known; all of which is to say that the judgments will fall away from you, and understand this."]}}
