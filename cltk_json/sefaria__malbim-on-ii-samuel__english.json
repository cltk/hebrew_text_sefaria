This was Jerusalem, which lay half in Yehudah and half in Benyamin as is written in the description of the borders of the land, and as the Sages taught \u201ca strip protruded from the portion of Yehudah into the portion of Benyamin and on it the altar was built.\u201d (Yoma 12a) We already explained (on Shoftim 1:8) that the children of Yehudah conquered their portion of Jerusalem while the children of Benyamin did not, and that is where the Jebusites dwelled: And the king and his men went \u2013 to drive out the Jebusites from the portion of Benyamin: who spoke to David, saying: 'you shall not come here \u2013 In order to understand the plain meaning of the verse, the words of the Ralbag are sweetest to me. He said that they placed statues in the form of the blind and the lame at the gates which were made in such a fashion that they swung extremely heavy iron rods. Thus no one was able to approach the gates because these statues would strike them down with their powerful motions (and it is possible that actual blind and lame people stood beneath them to help the rods move). The statues were close enough to the drainage channel that when it poured out water, its flow caused the statues and their rods to move just like a water mill \u2013 as we have seen such things with our own eyes. That is what he said. According to this, up against the gate of the city they erected a line of statues in the form of blind people and after this a line of statues in the form of lame people, and after this the drainage channel, while the citadel stood on the other side of the city. Between the city and the citadel stood the warriors, ready to fight o whichever side the enemy attempted to enter. At first David wanted to go in through the gate, and they said to him \u2018you shall not come here unless you remove the blind and the lame\u2019 meaning that it was impossible to enter unless he first removes the blind and then afterwards the lame who were driving the metal rods that prevented him from passing the gate. This is what it says \u2018you shall not come here,\u2019 that they are the one declaring that you shall not enter (that is, they will stop you.) (It is also possible that aside from this strategy, they considered these status to have godly powers as the ancient idolaters often did. They made their idols from wheels and hinges able to move and lift heavy things, and thus they deceived the foolish masses into believe that they were gods. This perspective combines with the opinion of our Sages that said the form of these idols hinted at the oath which Avraham or Yitzchak made to Avimelech.)"}, "1": "And David conquered \u2013 When he saw that it was not possible to conquer from the side of the city gate he went to the other side where the stronghold stood and conquered the stronghold of Zion. Therefore it was afterwards called the city of David, because he himself conquered it."}, "1": {"0": {"0": "AND DAVID sacrificed his own honor for the honor of Hashem in three ways:", "1": "A) In his body, that HE DANCED and ran WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BEFORE THE ARK OF HASHEM; B) in his dress, that he was WEARING A LINEN EPHOD, like the clothing of priests and servants of Hashem, and not the clothing of a king, so as not to show his pride before Hashem; and in these two, David was isolated from the people, for because of his status, he had to show his submission before the creator, as it is written, \"The king, once having bowed, does not straighten\" (BT Brachot 34b).  And on this, it is written AND DAVID, C) that all of Israel joined with him, as it is written, AND DAVID AND ALL OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF HASHEM, WITH TRUMPET-SOUNDS AND THE CALL OF THE SHOFAR, to awaken happiness and joy.  "}}, "2": {"0": "David arose after separating from the Ark of God, and he arrived at the Mount of Olives, for there he separated from God's city and began to cry and cover his head and remove his sandals like a mourner."}}}
