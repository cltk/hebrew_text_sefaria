(compare 5,2) \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8, before beginning with reviewing portions of the Torah, Moses explained the reason for the need to do this as being that they were about to cross into what would become their homeland where many commandments of the Torah would apply for the first time. Seeing that he could not do this at the time when they actually applied already, he had to do this now before his death.

As a result, such a repentance is not sufficient to cancel the punishment due in this life.

Seeing that this is so, we are commanded whenever faced with such choices to give preference to that which leads to spiritual righteousness at the expense of physical perfection or beauty. By the same token, we are to prefer spiritual qualities possessed by someone chosen as a judge to external features, impressive though they may be.  <br> The second item is \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d1\u05d4, even though such a kind of altar was welcomed by G\u2019d as an outlet for someone who wanted to bring an offering to G\u2019d, this was before the Torah had been given. Consider, for example, Exodus 24,4 where the Torah welcomed 12 such monuments erected by Moses, where these monuments symbolised the fact that the person offering a sacrifice considered himself as constantly in the presence of the divine. (compare Psalms 16,8 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05dc\u05e0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3, \u201cI feel myself constantly in the presence of the Lord.\u201d) The Jewish people had not been able to maintain this spiritual level after they had committed the sin of the golden calf. Even when such a \u05de\u05e6\u05d1\u05d4 is dedicated to heaven it had become hateful in the eyes of the Lord, i.e. G\u2019d had expressed His distaste in Exodus 33,3, after having provisionally \u201cforgiven\u201d the people by appointing an angel to lead them to the Holy Land, but refusing to lead their ascent by His presence being among them. We encounter a similar concept described as the difference between an old man whose beard proclaims his respectability, as opposed to the old man whose beard is disheveled, i.e. reveals traces of a youth which was spent irresponsibly.  We look for people whose exterior testifies to their blameless interior, character. [This metaphor is used by the Chazzan in his private introductory prayer on Yom Hakippurim. Ed.] <br> The third item, also reminding us of the rejection of an externally basically beautiful animal as a sacrifice, is a series of blemishes, some quite minor, not affecting the value of the animal in question in the market place at all. Such a blemish in an animal worth 1000 dollars disqualifies it as an offering, whereas another similar animal worth one single dollar, but without such a blemish, is given preference over the far more expensive animal, which is rejected. The Torah gives us three examples to teach us basically the same lesson. What is true of the blemished animal for presentation on the altar, is equally true for the venerable old scholar who is afflicted with some character fault.  We are to look further in order to find a less impressive individual not afflicted with such character fault."}, "3": {"0": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05da \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc\u05da \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, even though this was not a requirement on the original Passover in Egypt.", "1": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05e9\u05e8, so that you should not think that leftovers of the Passover sacrifice were forbidden only on the original occasion, seeing that on that occasion the people were in such a state of haste, that the Torah did not want leftover sacred meat to be at the disposal of the Egyptians.\n"}, "4": {"0": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05dc\u05d6\u05d1\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7, even though in Egypt there was no need to slaughter the Passover either on an altar or in a Temple (precincts), this is not the way it is to be observed in the future."}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea, on that day the Israelites are to be assembled together in communal worship of the Lord.

This is quite different from judges, each of whom is appointed for his lifetime, with his heirs having absolutely no claim to succeed their father. The people were commanded to appoint such a hereditary position of king after they had conquered and settled in the land of Israel, the principal reason being to ensure that the Jewish people would not be like a flock without a shepherd, (Moses\u2019 words in Numbers 27,17.)<br> The fact is that G\u2019d disapproved of a hereditary type of monarchy such as is customary among the gentile nations, so that He stipulated that if the people insisted on appointing a king who would start a dynasty, the initial king had to be approved not only by the people but by G\u2019d\u2019s representative on G\u2019d\u2019s behalf, as we know from Samuel I 8,18. The restrictions in appointing the original king were designed to ensure that such a king could not lead the people away from G\u2019d\u2019s Torah; on the contrary, they are meant for the people to see in him a shining example of Torah-observance, which in turn would inspire their own piety. Seeing that when the people asked Samuel for a king their purpose was far from what the Torah had legislated having a king for, the people were suitably punished as per the verse in Samuel I 8,18 that we referred to earlier. The prophet Hoseah 13,11 describes G\u2019d granting the people\u2019s wish as stemming from the fact that He was angry at them. Summing up, we may view the permission to appoint a king as being in the same category as the permission for a soldier to marry a physically attractive prisoner of war. G\u2019d, the master psychologist, knows that sometimes in order to become wise enough to appreciate the Torah\u2019s prohibitions, an individual, or even a whole nation, must find this out by having chosen in their own wisdom to ignore the Torah\u2019s preferences. David\u2019s experiences with his son Avshalom, born to such a prisoner of war whom he married because he was initially physically attracted to her, bears this out. In fact, his experience with his son Adoniah was not much better.

Whenever the Torah speaks about the Jewish people abandoning the laws of the Torah, the intention is not to make us think that they slid into anarchy, but worse, they slid into adopting the laws of the prevalent cultures and civilisations. Clearly, this is an even greater affront to G\u2019d the Lawgiver, than merely being passive and not carrying out Torah legislation. Social legislation involving tithes was largely ignored, leading to such great scholars as Hillel, and the High Priest Yochanan decreeing legalistic means of circumventing the legislation so that the people would not be guilty of violating such basic social laws as forgiving overdue debts at the end of the Sh\u2019mittah year. The Rabbis, in a number of instances, were forced to preserve the spirit of the law, sometimes at the expense of what may be termed \u201cthe letter of the law.\u201d The discontinuance of the examination by the priest of a woman suspected of marital infidelity, Sotah, is one such example, the Rabbis feeling that when infidelity had become the norm rather than the exception, it would not do to demand a miracle from G\u2019d every time such a situation arose. Moreover, the chances were that the husband\u2019s sexual life was not so free from blemish that he could point a finger at his wife. (Compare Shviit,1,3, Maasser Sheyni 5,15, Sotah 46,48,49) Other practices, such as referring disputes to pagan judges of the nation (Greeks or Romans) occupying Israel at the time, made it almost impossible for the Jewish judiciary, even when meaning to preside over Torah law, to be an effective legal instrument. All of these conditions became a self-fulfilling prophecy in the decline of the Jewish people as a holy nation and led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of Jewish independence on a land of their own."}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {}, "2": {}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {}, "23": {}, "24": {}, "25": {}, "26": {}, "27": {}, "28": {}, "29": {}, "3": {}, "30": {}, "31": {}, "32": {}, "33": {}, "34": {}, "35": {}, "36": {}, "37": {}, "38": {}, "39": {}, "4": {}, "40": {}, "41": {}, "42": {}, "43": {}, "44": {}, "45": {}, "46": {}, "47": {}, "48": {}, "49": {}, "5": {}, "50": {}, "51": {}, "52": {}, "53": {}, "54": {}, "55": {}, "56": {}, "57": {}, "58": {}, "59": {}, "6": {}, "60": {}, "61": {}, "62": {}, "63": {}, "64": {}, "65": {}, "66": {}, "67": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05ea\u05dd, you will begin to manufacture or make by hand all kinds of goods the host country lacks in order to secure your economic well being, but", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4, no one will buy these goods due to antisemitic reasons, as they do not want you to gain a foothold in their country.\n"}, "7": {}, "8": {}, "9": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05e2\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, as our sages told us on folio 69 in Yuma about Alexander the Great prostrating himself in front of that High Priest."}}, "28": {"0": {}, "1": {}, "10": {"0": "\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u05d1\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea, you are all arranged in this order in order to signal your acceptance of the forthcoming covenant.

This is basically what He will do at the end of \u201chistory,\u201d [history is perceived as a period of education for the people filling or making a brief appearance on the stage of history. Ed.]<br> Second, G\u2019d had provided the people with optimum conditions to serve Him joyfully while they enjoyed all the material advantages that life on earth has to offer. He gave them a beautiful country, one flowing with milk and honey, to do this in. Instead, they rebelled and repaid good with evil. There can be no question that the people responsible for frustrating G\u2019d\u2019s master plan deserve to be severely punished for this.<br> Third, due to the serious nature of their sin they deserve to be wiped out completely. If it were not for the desecration of the Lord\u2019s name that would be a by-product of the destruction of His chosen people, nothing would have prevented G\u2019d from administering this punishment.<br> Fourth, Moses reveals the reason why the redemption of the Jewish people will occur at the end of what we call \u201chistory,\u2019 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd.<br>  Fifth, Moses elaborates somewhat on the nature of this redemption and the retribution G\u2019d will wreak at that time on the other nations of the world. The nations will primarily be punished for what they did to the Jewish people throughout history. These then are the five sections into which the portion of Haazinu is divided, our sages having given us an easy way of reminding ourselves of this division by calling the portion \u05d4\u05d6\u05d9'\u05d5 \u05dc'\u05da. (Rosh Hashanah 31) Moses therefore commences with the words: \u05d6\u05db\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u201cstudy history and thereby learn to recognise how much G\u2019d had endeavoured to shower good upon you, starting already with first man whom He transferred to Gan Eden, the most exclusive environment on earth.", "1": "\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d3\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8, you will then understand what amount of goodness G\u2019d \u201csquandered\u201d on successive generations who did not deserve it.

(Shabbat 104) This statement also explains the rule that no Rabbinical assembly may invalidate a decree by another such Rabbinical assembly which had preceded it, unless it could be proven to be more competent and consisted of a greater number than the Rabbinical assembly which had originated said decree.

We have been told in Samuel I 10,6 that receiving even a small measure of prophetic insight makes the recipient an \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8, a different person. This is why the prophet Amos 2,11 when referring to the deeds of loving kindness performed by G\u2019d for the people lists the fact that G\u2019d gave many Israelites prophetic insights. The people, during Amos\u2019 time, instead of availing themselves of the spiritual inspiration thus accessible, forbade these prophets to impart their visions, etc., reversing and frustrating G\u2019d\u2019s purpose. Seeing that all of G\u2019d\u2019s activity stems exclusively from His own personal knowledge (cannot be evaluated properly by His creatures, seeing that they are \u201conly\u201d His creature) the Torah records G\u2019d as saying that  \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d4' \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, that in His communications with Moses and granting him insights into His ways, He did so exclusively for Moses\u2019 benefit. This expression \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 appears repeatedly in Scriptures in this sense of endowing someone with insights. One example is Psalms 144,3 \u05de\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05d5\u05ea\u05d3\u05e2\u05d4\u05d5, \u201cwhat did man do that You should take the trouble to grant him such insights?\u201d Another such example is found in Exodus 33,17 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d3\u05e2\u05da \u05d1\u05e9\u05dd, \u201cI granted you some insights about My essence, by making you familiar with some of My attributes.\u201d [my translation. Ed.] Compare also Exodus 2,25 Psalms1,6 and numerous other examples. [If I do not err, the author feels that seeing that G\u2019d\u2019s omniscience is axiomatic in Judaism, such phrases as the ones quoted cannot simply mean \u201cG\u2019d knew,\u201d for there would be no point in the Torah stating the obvious.
