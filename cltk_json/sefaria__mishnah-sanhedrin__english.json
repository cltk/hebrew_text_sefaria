And from where [do we derive that we] add three more? This is implied by the [verse], as it says, (Exodus 23:2) \"Do not follow the many to do evil.\" Should I learn to follow them to do good? If so, why does it say (Exodus 23:2) \"Following the many to distort [justice]\" - your following to do good is not like your following to do evil. Following to do good [i.e. acquittal] is by one, following to do evil [i.e. conviction] is by two. Since a court cannot [contain an] even [number of members], we add [to the number of judges] one more- behold this is twenty-three.

If so, why does it say, (Deuteronomy 17:17) \"He may not amass too many wives\"? [This condition applies even if she is] like Abigail. \"He may not amass too many horses\" (Deuteronomy 17:16), only enough for his chariots. \"And excessive silver and gold he may not amass\" (Deuteronomy 17:17), only enough to pay his soldiers' wages.

Rabbi Yose said, this is the teaching of Rabbi Akiva. But the original teaching [said]: his uncle, and the son of his uncle, all his potential heirs, and anyone related to him at that time. One who used to be related to him but is no longer- behold, he is acceptable. Rabbi Yehudah says, even if his daughter dies, and [his son-in-law] had children with her- behold, [the daughter's widowed husband] is a relation.", "4": "[These are also invalid]: the friend and the enemy.

Then they would send every man outside, but keep the eldest among them and say to him: \"Say how you know that the one owes the other.\" If he says, \"He told me, 'I owe him,'\" or, \"So-and-so told me that he owes him\" - this means nothing. Only if he says, \"In front of us, he told him that he owes him two hundred <i>zuz</i>\" [is his testimony meaningful]. After this, they would bring in the second [witness] and examine him.

[If] they said to him: \"All evidence that you have, bring it here within thirty days.\" If he finds [evidence] within thirty days, it overturns [the previous verdict]. After thirty days, it does not overturn. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what could he have done, for he did not find [evidence] within thirty days, but [only] after thirty days! [If] they said to him, \"Bring witnesses,\" and he says, \"I have no witnesses\"; [or] they say to him, \"Bring evidence,\" and he says, \"I have no evidence\"; and after a time he brings evidence or finds witnesses, behold this means nothing. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what could he have done, for he did not know that he had witnesses and [only later] found witnesses, [or] he did not know that he had evidence and [only later] found evidence! [If] they said to him, \"Bring witnesses\" and he says, \"I have no witnesses\"; or [they say,] \"Bring evidence,\" and he says, \"I have no evidence\"; and he sees that he will be convicted and says, \"Come near so-and-so and so-and-so, and testify for me,\" or he found evidence from his wallet, behold this means nothing."}, "3": {"0": "Both monetary and capital cases have examination and inquiry, as it is written (Leviticus 24:22) \"You shall have one justice.\" What is the difference between monetary cases  and capital cases: monetary cases[are tried] with three [judges], and capital cases, with twenty-three. Monetary cases are opened either [with arguments] to acquit or to convict, and capital cases open [with arguments] to acquit but do not open [with arguments] to convict. Monetary cases are decided by one either to acquit or to convict; capital cases are decided by one to acquit or by two to convict. In monetary cases, [the verdict] can change between acquittal and conviction; in capital cases [the verdict] can change to acquittal but cannot change to conviction. In monetary cases, all can rule for acquittal or conviction; in capital cases, all can rule for acquittal but all cannot rule for conviction. In monetary cases, one who convicts can acquit and one who acquits can convict; in capital cases, one who convicts can acquit, but one who acquits cannot turn and convict. Monetary cases can be tried in the day and can finish in the night; capital cases are tried in the day and must finish in the day.

It was comprised of 71 scholars who had received the full traditional rabbinical ordination, and its decisions fixed Jewish practice for subsequent generations.]was [organized like] half of a round granary, so that each (judge) could see each [judge]. Two court scribes stood before them, one on the right and one on the left, and they wrote the words of the acquitting [defense] and the words of the convicting [prosecution].

One from the second [row] comes to the first, and one from the third [row] comes to the second, and they choose for them one more [student] from the community who is seated in the third [row]. He didn't sit in the place of the first [student], but rather he sits in the place seen for him.", "4": "How do we press the witnesses in a capital case? We bring them in [to the court's chambers] and press them: \"Perhaps what you say [isn't eyewitness testimony] is but your own assessment, or from rumors, or your witnessing an actual witness testify, or your reporting what a trustworthy said. Or perhaps you were unaware that by the end we'd interrogate you, with examination and inquiry. Know that capital cases are not like monetary ones. In monetary cases, [a false witness] can return the money and achieve atonement. But in capital cases, the blood of [the victim [and all his future offspring hang upon you until the end of time. For thus we find in regard to Cain, who killed his brother, \"The bloods of your brother scream out!\" (Genesis 4:10) - the verse does not say blood of your brother, but bloods of your brother, because it was his blood and also the blood of his future offspring [screaming out]! [Another explanation of the verse: for his blood was splattered over the trees and rocks  [there was more than one pool of blood]. [The judges' speech continues] \"It was for this reason that man was first created as one person [Adam], to teach you that anyone who destroys a life  is considered by Scripture to have destroyed an entire world; and anyone who saves a life is as if he saved an entire world.\" And also, to promote peace among the creations, that no man would say to his friend, \"My ancestors are greater than yours.\" And also, so that heretics will not say, \"there are many rulers up in Heaven.\" And also, to express the grandeur of The Holy One [blessed be He]: For a man strikes many coins from the same die, and all the coins are alike. But the King, the King of Kings, The Holy One [blessed be He] strikes every man from the die of the First Man, and yet no man is quite like his friend. Therefore, every person must say, \u201cFor my sake \u200ethe world was created.\u201d\u200e [The judges' speech continues:] \"Maybe you [the witnesses] will now say, 'What do we need this, and all this anxiety for [let's not come forward even with true testimony]!' But Scripture has already spoken: \"If he be a witness - having seen or known - if he does not express it, he shall bear his sin.\" (Lev. 5:1) Maybe you will now say, 'What do we need this, to be responsible for another man's death?'

Once, Ben Zakkai examined regarding the stalks of figs. What is the difference between inquiries and examinations?

[If in response to] examinations one [witness] says, \"I do not know,\" and even if two say, \"We do not know,\" their testimony stands. Both [with respect to] inquiries and examinations, when [the two witnesses' responses] contradict one another, their testimony is nullified.", "2": "[If] one [witness] says, \"on the second of the month,\" and one says, \"on the third of the month,\" their testimony stands, since one is aware of the intercalation of the month, and the other is unaware of the intercalation of the month. [If] one says, \"on the third\" and one says, \"on the fifth,\" their testimony is nullified. [If] one says, \"at the second hour,\" and one says, \"at the third hour,\" their testimony stands. [If] one says, \"at the third hour\" and one says, \"at the fifth hour,\" their testimony is nullified. Rabbi Yehudah says, it stands. One says, \"at the fifth hour\" and one says, \"at the seventh hour,\" their testimony is nullified, since at the fifth [hour], the sun is in the east; whereas at the seventh [hour], the sun is in the west.", "3": "After, they bring in the second [witness] and examine him. If it is found that their words are aligned, they open with [arguments for] acquittal. If one of the witnesses says, \"I have something to say on acquittal,\" or one of the students says, \"I have something to say on conviction,\" they silence him. If one of the students says, \"I have something to say on acquittal,\" they raise him up and seat him among them; and he would not descend from there the whole day.

And even if [the accused] says, \"I have something to say on my own acquittal,\" they listen to him, but only if his words have substance.", "4": "If they found him innocent, they dismiss him. If not, they move his judgment to the next day. They would go together, pair by pair; and they would decrease [the amount of] food [they would eat]; and they would drink no wine all day; and they would deliberate all night; and on the morrow, early, they would rise and come to the court. The [judge arguing] to acquit says, \"I [argued to] acquit and my [opinion remains] in place\"; and the [judge arguing] to convict says, \"I [argued to] convict and my [opinion remains] in place.\" One who has offered an argument to convict may [subsequently] offer an argument to acquit, but one who has offered an argument to acquit may not retract [and subsequently] offer an argument to convict. If they had erred, the two judicial scribes remind them. If they found him innocent, they dismiss him. If not, they stand to vote. [If] twelve acquit and eleven convict, he is acquitted. If twelve convict and eleven acquit; and even if eleven acquit, eleven convict, and one says, \"I do not know\"; or even if twenty-two acquit or convict and one says \"I do not know,\" they add [more] judges.

The stoning site was outside of beth-din [far from beth-din, so that when they were conducting him there something might be found in his defense and he be exonerated], viz.

If someone says: \"I have something to say in his defense,\" the first waves the scarves and the rider runs and stops (the execution). And even if he says: \"I have something to say in my defense,\" he is returned, even four or five times, so long as there is substance in what he says. [And if there is no substance in what he says, he is returned only the first and second times, on the possibility that his fright had \"stopped up\" his defense and that he might regain his self-possession and formulate his claims. But he is not returned more than this. And he is provided with two Torah scholars to determine whether there is substance in his words, in which instance he is returned four or five times.] If they found something in his favor, he was acquitted. If not, he is taken out to be stoned. And a crier goes out before him, (proclaiming): \"This man is taken out to be stoned because he committed this and this transgression, and so and so are his witnesses\" [that he committed this and this transgression at this and this time at this and this place \u2014 this, to render them subject to hazamah.]", "1": "\tAt a distance of ten cubits from the stoning site he is told: \"Confess.\" [For when he is close to it, he might panic and not be able to confess.] For all who are to be put to death confess.

And if he does not know how to confess, he is told: \"Say: 'Let my death be an atonement for all of my sins.'\" R. Yehudah says: If he knows that he was falsely testified against, he says: \"Let my death be an atonement for all of my transgressions except this one.\" This was countered: If so, all men (sentenced to death) will say this in order to acquit themselves [in the eyes of their fellows and thus come to discredit the judges and the witnesses.

Yehudah.]", "2": "\tAt a distance of four cubits from the stoning site, they remove his clothing, [it being written (Leviticus 24:23): \"And they stoned him\" \u2014 without his garment.] A man is covered in front [i.e., a small section in front (his genitals)], and a woman (is covered) in front and in back.

Yehudah.] And the sages say: A man is stoned naked (except for that one region), but a woman is not stoned naked, (i.e., she must be fully clothed)].", "3": "\tThe stoning site [from which he was thrown to the ground] was two (men's) heights. If he turned over on his heart, (facing the ground), he is turned over on his back, [for lying prone is more demeaning.] If he dies from it (i.e., from the fall), the requirement (of stoning) is satisfied; and if not, the second (witness) takes the stone and casts it at his heart. If he dies from that, the requirement is satisfied. If not, he is stoned by all of Israel, viz. (Deuteronomy 17:7): \"The hand of the witnesses shall be against him first to kill him, and the hand of all the people afterwards.\" All of those who are stoned are (afterwards) hung up. These are the words of R. Eliezer. And the sages say: Only the blasphemer [of the L rd] and the idolator are hung up, [the idolator also being a blasphemer, viz. (Numbers 15:30): \"And the soul who acts with a high hand \u2026 it is the L rd whom he blasphemes.\" And that section speaks of idolatry.] A man is hung up facing the people, and a woman facing the wood. These are the words of R. Eliezer. The sages say: A man is hung up and a woman is not hung up. R. Eliezer countered: \"Did not Shimon b. Shetach hang up women in Ashkelon?\" They answered: He hung up eighty women, and two are not judged [in one beth-din] in one day. [For it is not possible to seek a defense for each of them (in one day). So that the hanging up of those women must have been dictated by the circumstances, and cannot serve as a precedent. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] How is he hung up (after he is executed)? A pole is sunk in the ground with a beam projecting from it, and his two hands are joined (and bound) together, and he is hung up [by his hands]. R. Yossi says: The beam is placed against the wall, and he is suspended upon it, as butchers do (with slaughtered animals). [It was not rooted in the ground, but one of its ends was on the ground, and the other inclined against the wall. The rationale of R. Yossi: The wood on which he was suspended was buried with him, and the Torah states (Deuteronomy 21:23): \"But bury shall you bury him\" \u2014 he who lacks only burying; to exclude that which lacks digging up, uprooting, and burying. And the (rationale of the) rabbis: Digging up is of no import. The Torah excluded only its being rooted from the beginning. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] And he is let down immediately. And if he is allowed to remain there overnight, he (the one who allows it) transgresses a negative commandment, viz.

And not only this [i.e., not only one who leaves an executed man hanging overnight transgresses], but whoever leaves his dead one (unburied) overnight transgresses a negative commandment. If he left him overnight for his honor, to bring a casket or shrouds for him, he does not transgress. And they would not bury him (one executed by beth-din) in the crypts of his forefathers, [for an evildoer is not buried next to a righteous man], but there were two burial grounds allotted to beth-din, one for those killed by the sword or by strangulation, and the other, for those killed by stoning or burning.

A man who lives with a male or with a beast, and a woman who brings a beast upon her: If the man sinned, how has the beast sinned?

A murderer: If one struck his neighbor with stone or iron, or pressed him down in water or fire, so that he could not rise [e.g., if he held his head underwater so that he could not raise it], and he died, he is liable. If he pressed him into water or fire, but he could have escaped, he is not liable. If he incited a dog or a snake against him, he is not liable. If he caused a snake to bite him, [i.e., if he held a snake in his hand and placed its teeth against another's body], R. Yehudah rules him liable [He holds that a snake's venom is in its teeth, so that when he places its teeth against one's body, it is as if he kills him, and he is liable], and the sages rule him not liable. [They hold that the snake brings up its venom of itself, so that it is not as if the man killed him directly but only indirectly, and he is not liable. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] If one struck his neighbor, whether with a stone or with his fist, and they predicted that he would die, [(but if they predicted that he would live, even the rabbis hold that he is not liable)], and his condition improved, [whereupon they predicted that he would live], and then it worsened and he died, he is liable.

Nechemiah says that he is not liable, for there are indications [that he did not die because of this blow.]", "1": "\tIf one's intent were to kill a beast and he killed a man; a gentile and he killed a Jew; a premature child (who would not survive) and he killed one who would have survived, he is not liable.

[For both must be satisfied: that he intend to kill and that the blow be sufficient to kill.] If his intent were to strike him a lethal blow on his heart, where it would be lethal, and it went to his hips, where it was not sufficient to kill, and he died, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike an adult, but the blow would not suffice to do so, and it went to a child, where it would suffice, and he died, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike a child, and the blow would suffice to kill him, and it went to an adult, whom it would not suffice to kill, and he died, he is not liable. But if his intent were to strike one on his hips, where the blow would suffice to kill him, and it went to his heart and he died, he is liable. If his intent were to strike an adult, whom the blow would suffice to kill, and it went to a child, who died, he is liable. R. Shimon says: Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, he is not liable. [This does not refer to the latter statement of the first tanna, viz.: \"If his intent were to strike an adult, whom the blow would suffice to kill, and it went to a child, who died, he is liable\"; for if it did, it should simply have been stated: \"R. Shimon says that he is not liable.\" And why repeat: \"Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, etc.\"? The first tanna states this explicitly. Why the \"Even\"? R. Shimon, rather, refers to the first statement, viz.: \"If one's intent were to kill a beast and he killed a man, he is not liable,\" the implication being that if it were his intent to kill a man and he killed another man, he is liable. It is in this regard that R. Shimon says: \"Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, he is not liable.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon.]", "2": "\tIf a murderer were mixed in with others, all are not liable. [e.g., If two men were standing and an arrow went out from between them and killed someone, both are not liable. And even if one of them were known for saintliness, so that it is certain that he did not shoot the arrow, still, the other is not made liable on this presumption.] R. Yehudah says: They are incarcerated. [Our Mishnah is defective. It was taught thus: \"And if an ox whose judgment (for killing a man) were pronounced became intermixed with other oxen, they are all stoned.\" For, perforce, it is forbidden to derive benefit from all of them \u2014 even if they were a thousand \u2014 because of the one intermixed with them. Therefore, they are all stoned, so that the mitzvah of stoning be satisfied with the one liable to it.] R. Yehudah says: They are incarcerated. It is not necessary to stone them, but they are all gathered into a room and they die of hunger. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] All those liable to judicial death penalty who became intermixed with one another are given the lesser penalty. If men sentenced to be stoned became intermixed with others sentenced to be burned, R. Shimon says: They are stoned, for burning is more severe. The sages say: They are burned, for stoning is more severe. R. Shimon said to them: \"If burning were not more severe, it would not be administered to a Cohein's daughter who committed adultery.\" They said to him: If stoning were not more severe, it would not be administered to a blasphemer and an idolator!\" If men sentenced to decapitation became intermixed with others sentenced to strangulation, R. Shimon says (they are to be decapitated) with the sword, [strangulation being more severe.] The sages say: They are to be strangled, [decapitation begin more severe].", "3": "\tIf one were liable to two judicial death penalties, he is given the more severe.

Yossi says: He is judged according to the first relationship [that he must shun, and not according to the latter, even if it is more severe. For R. Yossi holds that one prohibition does not \"take\" upon another, even one that is more severe upon one that is less severe. So that if he wed the daughter of a widow, who was first his mother-in-law when she was single, and then she married, he is sentenced to burning (if he lives with her). And if she were married and then she became his mother-in-law, he is sentenced to strangulation, the penalty for living with a married woman, which she was first (before she became his mother-in-law).

If one kills someone without witnesses, [i.e., in the absence of testimony that would make him liable to the death penalty \u2014 though it is known to beth-din that it is true, that he certainly killed; but the witnesses were refuted in cross-examination or sufficient warning was lacking], they place him in a cell and feed him scant bread and \"water of distress\" [first, and then they feed him barley until his stomach bursts.

In the absence of one of these conditions, it is forbidden to kill him. But his punishment is stated by the prophet (Malachi 2:12): \"The L rd will cut off from the man that commits this, etc.\" And he is given stripes four times by ordinance of the scribes: by reason of (cohabiting with) a niddah, by reason of a bondswoman, by reason of an idolatress, and by reason of a harlot.] If a Cohein officiates in a state of uncleanliness, his fellow Cohanim do not bring him to beth-din but the pirchei kehunah (the young priests) [whose beards have begun to sprout (lifroach)] take him outside of the azarah (the Temple court) and split his skull with clubs. If a zar (a non-priest) officiates in the Temple, R.

The halachah is in accordance with the sages. Death at the hands of Heaven is less severe than kareth. For with kareth, one bears transgression after death if he did not repent adequately, whereas with death at the hands of Heaven, he bears nothing after death. Rashi writes in Shabbath (25a) that with death at the hands of Heaven, his days are shortened, but he does not go childless, whereas with kareth, both obtain: his days are cut off and he goes childless. Those liable to death at the hands of Heaven for (abuse of) the sanctuary and of sanctified objects are eleven: one who eats tevel (untithed produce), an unclean Cohein who eats clean terumah, a non-priest who eats terumah, a non-priest, an unclean (priest), and a tvul yom (one who immersed in the daytime and did not wait until sunset) who officiates, one lacking atonement, one lacking (the full complement of priestly) garments, one who did not lave his hands and feet, one who is drunk, and one with disheveled hair.

For in the medrash of the scribes it is written: The word \"letotafoth\" is written three times (Exodus 13:16, Deuteronomy 6:8, and Deuteronomy 11:18), twice defective and once plene, giving a total of four sections (in the head phylactery)].", "3": "\tHe (a rebellious elder) is executed neither by the beth-din of his city nor by the beth-din in Yavneh [If they inquired of the beth-din in the chamber of hewn stone, and they ruled for him, and he returned to his city and remained there many days, until the great Sanhedrin was exiled to Yavneh, and then he ruled as at first, he is not executed in Yavneh, even though the great Sanhedrin is there, and even if the Temple still stands, the great Sanhedrin not sitting in its place in the chamber of hewn stone.], but he is brought up to the great beth-din in Jerusalem and kept there until the festival, it being written (Deuteronomy 17:13): \"And all the people shall hear and fear and not presume again.\" These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yehudah says: His judgment is not delayed, but he is executed immediately, and it is written, and messengers are sent (to proclaim) in all places: \"This man, the son of this man, was found liable to the death penalty by beth-din.\"", "4": "\tA false prophet \u2014 one who prophesies what he did not hear [i.e., what was not stated in prophecy to any prophet], and what was not said to him, [but to his colleague, from whom he heard it, and he came and said that it was said to him] \u2014 his death is at the hands of man. [Both of these are false prophets, and their death is by strangulation, it being written (Deuteronomy 18:20): \"But the prophet who shall presume to speak a thing in My name\" \u2014 this is one who prophesies what he never heard \u2014 \"which I did not command him\" \u2014 but which I commanded to his neighbor. This is one who prophesies what was not said to him but which was said to his neighbor \u2014 \"that prophet shall be put to death\"; and every death mentioned in the Torah, unqualified, is strangulation.] But if one suppresses his prophecy, or makes light of the words of a prophet, or transgresses his own prophecy, his death is at the hands of Heaven, it being written (Ibid. 19): \"I shall require it of him.\" [It is written (Ibid. 19): \"And it shall be, the man who shall not heed (lo yishma) My words.\" It can be read \"lo yishma\" (i.e., another) \"will not heed,\" and \"lo yashmia\" \"he will not make heard,\" and \"lo yishmah,\" i.e., he himself \"will not heed,\" so that all three are included, followed by \"I shall require it of him\" \u2014 at the hands of Heaven.]", "5": "\tOne who prophesies in the name of idolatry, saying: \"Thus did this idolatry say\" (is put to death by strangulation), even if he (i.e., what he said) coincided with the halachah, to declare the unclean unclean, and the clean, clean. One who lives with a married woman, once she enters the groom's domain for marriage, [as when the father hands her over to the groom's messengers and she is still on the way to him, in which instance she is no longer regarded as being in \"her father's house\"], is put to death by strangulation. And the zomemin of the daughter of a Cohein and her consort (are put to death by strangulation). For all zomemin \"come forward\" for that death [that they would make the adjudged liable to], except the zomemin of the daughter of a Cohein and her consort [i.e., All who live (illicitly) with a woman are subject to the same death as she, except for the consort of the daughter of a Cohein, she being subject to burning, and he, to strangulation.]"}}}
