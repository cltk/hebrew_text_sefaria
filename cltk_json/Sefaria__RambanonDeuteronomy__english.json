And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh; Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.\" Here it is explicit that they did not enter at all into the land of Edom nor into the land of Moab and if they had entered there they would have been sold bread and water since it is not the custom to allow a people's army to pass through the land and not have bread and water sold to them, and it seems to me that the pasuk distanced these two brothers who recieved kindness from Avraham who saved their father and mother from the sword and cativity (Gen. 14:16) and in whose merit God sent them from the destruction (Gen. 19:29) and they owed kindness to Israel, but they did them an ill turn, the one by hiring Bilam ben Be'or, and those are the Moabites, and the other who did not recieve them with bread and water when Israel approached them, as it says (Deut. 2:18-19) you are passing today the border of Moav, Ar, and approaching Bnei Ammon, and here the verse warns them (Deut. 2:19) Don't harass them and don't contend with them and they didn't welcome them at all, since then the verse would have said \"as the sons of Esau, the Moabites and the Ammonites did\", but the Ammonites are not mentioned since they did not welcome them, and thus Ammon was more wicked than the others, since the sons of Esau and the Moabites, when they knew that Israel would not contend with them, brought out bread and water outside their borders, and Ammon did not deign to do so, and this is the reason for |\"who did not welcome them\", that they did not go forth towards them with bread and water as the others did, and therefore the verse mentioned the \"Ammonite\" first, and mentioned his crime first, that they didn't welcome them, and only then mentioned the \"Moabite\" and their sin.
