Elazar said: \"Those who go on a religious mission, will not meet with evil either going to, or from, their duty.\" R. Elazar was in accord with the opinion of the Tanna, Issi b.

If, regarding the things which are exposed to injury, it is promised that no harm will occur, how much the more so regarding things that are usually not exposed to injury? This conclusion I could only arrive at with reference to protection while on the way to perform [a meritorious act]. Whence, however, do we infer that even on the return, no harm will occur? It is said (Deuteronomy 16:7) \u2018And thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents.\u2019 From this passage we may learn that Thou wilt go and find thy tents in peace. Since even on the return [he will meet no evil], wherefore is it necessary to mention [the protection] on the way going to perform the religious duty? We must therefore say this statement is necessary for the reference to what R. Ami said: \"Every man who has land is in duty bound to visit Jerusalem during the festivals, but a man who has no land need not visit Jerusalem during the festivals.\" R. Abin b. R. Adda said in the name of R. Isaac: \"Why was there not Gennesar-fruit in the land of Israel? Lest those who visit Jerusalem during the festivals should say, 'Had we come here merely to enjoy of the Gennesar-fruit: it would have been sufficient.' Hence their visit would become not as a matter of duty.\" The same said R. Dastoe b. Janai: \"Why are not the hot springs of Tiberias located in Jerusalem? For the simple reason that those who visit Jerusalem during the festivals, should not say, 'Were it for nothing else than to bathe ourselves in the hot springs of Tiberias that we visited Jerusalem, it would have been sufficient! Thus their visiting Jerusalem would turn out to be not as a matter of duty.\" \n"}, "5": {"0": "...Every moment that one is allowed to eat hametz, he is allowed to feed his domesticated animal, wild animal, and birds; and he could sell the hametz to a gentile, and he is allowed to derive benefit.
