Moses is to tell Pharaoh in G\u2019d\u2019s name that if He had delivered the Israelites under his control in order to discipline them somewhat this was not because He, their G\u2019d, had rejected them. We know this from Moses telling the people in Deuteronomy 8,8 that any discomfort they had ever been subjected to in their journey was due to the discipline administered by a loving father to miscreant children. The father does not enjoy punishing his children but it is necessary in order for them to learn that misconduct carries a price. Pharaoh had greatly exceeded the authority he had to be G\u2019d\u2019s agent in educating the Israelites. As a fitting retribution G\u2019d would kill Pharaoh\u2019s own firstborn during the last of the plagues.

Moses who had become exposed to these manifestations involving his own people even after G\u2019d had told him that He had taken note of the injustice done to them, did not understand all this. Moses also did not understand which afflictions have what purpose, as sometimes they appear to strike people who clearly are guilty of certain sins, as per Isaiah 57,17 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05e6\u05e2\u05d5 \u05e7\u05e6\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05db\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e7\u05e6\u05d5\u05e3, \u201cFor their sinful greed I was angry; I struck them and turned away in My wrath.\u201d On the other hand, Moses also realised that there is an affliction known as \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4, afflictions resulting from G\u2019d\u2019s love, such as the manna being described as \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e0\u05da \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05d1\u05da, \u201cHe afflicted you by letting you starve,\u201d (Deuteronomy 8,16) where the very affliction was the forerunner of acts of love such as the heavenly bread G\u2019d fed the Israelites for 40 years in the desert. Concerning such afflictions David has said in Psalms 94,12 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05ea\u05d9\u05e1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d9-\u05d4, \u201chail the man whom G\u2018d has seen fit to subject to such afflictions!\u201d When Moses noticed that from the day he had begun his mission and had confronted Pharaoh the workload of his brethren had been increased instead of decreased, he asked G\u2019d why He had permitted Pharaoh to get away with this when it was clearly within His power to save the Israelites altogether? Why had He not immediately saved the people seeing that it was His plan to do this, and he had appointed him to be His instrument in bringing this about? He could not understand that if even the midwives, who are only human beings, not possessing the power to give life or to kill, are being credited with \u201cgiving life to the babies whom they refused to murder\u201d (Exodus 1,17) why G\u2019d Who is surely able to grant such life, did not save the same Jews whom He credited the midwives with saving? We must surely understand the line \u05d5\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, as \u201cthey allowed the children to keep living,\u201d not as \u201cthey granted life to the children!\u201d Here too, the words \u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4 have to be understood as \u201cwhy did You allow the Egyptians to continue to do evil to the this people instead of Your having saved them?\u201d Moses\u2018 question expressed concern that Pharaoh would be allowed to continue in this vein and to make the lives of the Israelites still more miserable. Actually, Moses\u2019 question here is echoed by the prophet Jeremiah 12,1 when the prophet asked:\u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d5\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d2\u05d3,\u201dwhy does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are the workers of treachery at ease?\u201d The prophet did not criticise G\u2019d but wanted to know if the prosperity enjoyed by the wicked is in payment of the good deeds which most of them also have performed at one time or other and which G\u2019d cannot repay them in the hereafter seeing they have already forfeited their afterlife so that they have to enjoy their reward while on this earth. Alternatively, did G\u2019d grant these people an enjoyable life on earth in order to increase the punishment they would endure after their bodies had died? G\u2019d answered Moses that the apparent success of Pharaoh was only in order to make him suffer so much more in the end. The matter is similar to that described by David in Psalms 69,28 where he asks G\u2019d concerning the Gentile nations: \u05ea\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dc \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05dd \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05ea\u05da, \u201cadd that to their guilt; let them have no share of Your beneficence.\u201d In our verse G\u2019d\u2019s answer to Moses was given in Exodus 6,1 \u05e2\u05ea\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4, \u201cfrom now on you will see what I am going to do to Pharaoh.\u201d G\u2019d meant, that the afflictions which Israel had to suffer had as their purpose to double the reward they would reap. This is the meaning of: \u201cnow you will see.\u201d You, Moses, will see and realise shortly that the relative peace which Pharaoh has enjoyed up until now was only meant to enable Me to increase the afflictions which I will subject him to. I had already made ready all these plagues. It was necessary for him to impose even harder working conditions on the Israelites in order to trigger carrying out My program, something which I had made ready on the day that I appointed you even though you did not realise this at the time. Not only is the result of My plan increased suffering for Pharaoh, but it is also increased reward for the Jewish people. The fact that they were able to endure it and did not collapse under this burden is proof that these afflictions  were motivated by My love for that people."}, "5": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05db\u05df.

G\u2019d, i.e. Moses, commanded the people to ask for these trinkets, garments, etc., as outright gifts. G\u2019d would see to it that the Israelites asking for this would be considered by the Egyptians as deserving of this so that they would gladly part with the items in question. This did not involve any misrepresentation on the part of G\u2019d, the Egyptians being perfectly aware that nothing they would give their Israelite neighbours could even remotely compensate them for the wages these people had never received during all these years. In that connection, consider that a Jewish servant (for whose services his master paid six years\u2019 wages in advance to the servant\u2019s creditor) at the end of his 6 years of service must be given an ex gratia payment by his master so that he can establish himself economically.

The pillar of cloud did not depart from them to lead them the way by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to give them light in the way they were to go.\u201d How then were they possibly able to determine the times of the new moon and all the important elements of the calendar depending on this by visual observation? There is no question that the central commandment meant by our verse is to calculate the times of the new moon by astronomical means.<br>  We have an ancient tradition that of the 12 months of the year 5 have 30 days each, whereas another five have 29 days each. The remaining two months sometimes have 29 days and other times 30 days. Sometimes, one of the two months in question has 30 days, whereas the other one has 29 days. The two months referred to are always Marcheshvan and Kislev. We also have an ancient tradition that the first day of the month of Tishrey is at the same time the first day of the New year. Every single month, according to tradition handed down since the time of Moses, consists (astronomically speaking) of 29 days 12 hours and 793 parts of the 1080 parts into which I hour (60 minutes) is divided in Jewish law. <br> This tradition is spelled out in Chronicles I 12,32: \u05d5\u05de\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e9\u05db\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea \u05de\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05de\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd,\u201dand from the tribe of Issachar, men who knew how to interpret the signs of the times to determine how they should act, their chiefs were 200, and all their kinsmen followed them.\u201d There is no discipline that requires greater wisdom than the calculation of the mysteries connected to when the lunar cycle renews itself.<br> Once one has already seen the new moon, it is a well known fact that such a day is observed officially as the new moon and our festivals are calculated on that basis, for instances Passover on the 15th of the month of Nissan, etc. The calculation upon which the real renewal of the lunar cycle is based, known as \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 in our halachic literature, is something which is calculated not visually but astronomically by our sages, something which required special ordination for the people entrusted with that task [before the introduction of a permanent calendar. Ed.]  The people would be informed by the result of the sages\u2019 calculations when this still was required. They would accept this ruling without fail. This is the meaning of the words in Chronicles we have quoted: \u201cand all their kinsmen followed them.\u201d<br> You will find another reference to this subject in Samuel I 20,5 where David and Yonathan discussed the imminent celebration of the new moon, (2 days on that occasion). If the determination of the date of the new moon had depended on visual observation, how could David have known beforehand that the new moon would be observed both on the 30th of the month and the day following on that occasion, seeing the moon had not yet been sighted as yet? Clearly, the determination was made on the basis of astronomical data, and David was aware that in view of the previous month having been a month of 29 days that according to the astronomical data the new moon following would have to be observed on two days. The text there (verse 24-26) reads as follows: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05dc\u05d7\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05dc.. \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0, \u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0....\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05de\u05de\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05e7\u05d3 \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3. \u201cDavid hid in the field. On the new moon the king sat down to eat and he did not say a word (about David\u2019s absence) saying it is the result of seminal ejaculation, presumably he is ritually impure [and had no chance to immerse himself in a ritual bath. Ed.] so that he could not attend. It came to pass on the second new moon, etc.\u201d<br>  [There follows the famous altercation between Yonathan and his father, etc, which I do not bother to repeat here as it is not really necessary for the author\u2019s point to be made. Ed.]<br> From the context of the story, it is quite impossible to understand the last words as applying to the celebration of the new moon on the following month. It is clear therefore that even in the days of King Sha-ul arrangements had been made beforehand to observe 2 days of Rosh Chodesh. Such arrangements beforehand were based on the calculations of the Sanhedrin, Supreme Court. What was the custom in the days of King Sha-ul continued for a period of about 1100 years from the time of Moses until the days of Antignos the head of the Supreme Court during the early days of the Second Temple. When two of the students of this sage by the name of Tzadok and Beyssus heard their mentor say \u201cdo not be like the servants who serve their master because of the reward they expect to receive as compensation, but serve the master for altruistic considerations,\u201d they began to question the entire foundations of Judaism, the concept of reward and punishment. They concluded that based on their mentor\u2019s words there was no such concept in Judaism, and they began to live in a style which reflected their new found philosophical freedom. Once they had crossed this threshold they began to question the tradition of calculating the new moon astronomically rather than by visual observation, challenging the established authorities whose ruling was based on the oral Torah rather than on the written text as per our verse above i.e. the word \u05d6\u05d4, \u201cthis,\u201d which implies visual observation. This was the beginning of the schism in Judaism, the heretics being known as \u05e6\u05d3\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, based on the name of the originator Tzadok. Their basic argument was to challenge the tradition which did not clearly base itself on the written text of the Torah.<br> The Torah sages during that period saw themselves forced to counter the arguments of these people by proving that what they did based on tradition did not contravene the text of the written Torah, but that what had been the accepted manner in which the sages determined these dates was not only accurate but was always in harmony with the Torah.<br> Rabban Gamliel in Rosh Hashanah 25 already told his audience not to put too much stock into the need to actually see the new moon before the festival of the new moon could be observed, seeing that the astronomical data outweigh the importance of visual confirmation. He quoted a long family tradition to support his view. The calculation he referred to stated that the length of a lunar month is never shorter than 29 and a half days and 793 portions of the 1080 divisions into which the 13th hour is divided.<br> These words of Rabban Gamliel prove that he, who more than anyone else provided elaborate safeguards to prove if witnesses claiming to have sighted the new moon had spoken the truth, did not in fact base his decisions on the testimony of these eye-witnesses at all.<br> There is also an entire Mishnah on the same folio in the Talmud which reads: \u201cif the entire supreme Court as well as the people generally had come to testify to the sighting of the new moon, and the examination of the testimony had taken so much time that at the end it was already too late to declare that day as \u201cnew moon,\u201d the following day would be declared as new moon. This Mishnah is clear proof that the Court did not have a tradition according to which the actual sighting of the new moon was the decisive factor in determining the calendar. If they did have a tradition that the sighting determines the dates, how could they have bothered to examine more than the necessary number of two witnesses and allow the opportunity to declare that date as new moon to go by without sanctifying it?<br> An even more convincing proof is the following. The Talmud states there that if two witnesses arrived at the court and they testified: \u201cwe saw the new moon on the evening of what would have been the 30th of the month, and on the following evening we did not see it again,\u201d Rabban Gamliel accepted this testimony as believable. If the court had based their determination on the sighting of the moon rather than on the astronomical calculations, surely the fact that the moon, according to their testimony, had not been visible on the following night must have proved that the witnesses had been lying! Rabban Gamliel\u2019s acceptance then meant that he had calculated that the correct date was the date of the first sighting reported by the witnesses. Seeing that there was then a new month and the court had sanctified it this was the end of the matter.<br>  [the balance of their testimony was quite irrelevant. There are numerous other interpretations as to why Rabban Gamliel accepted these witnesses. All agree that Rabban Gamliel was not really interested in sightings when the sightings conflicted with his astronomical data. Ed.]<br> The Talmud reports that in Rabban Gamliel\u2019s study there were maps of the sky depicting different possible or impossible positions of the moon at the time of the new moon, which the Rabbi used to determine if the testimony of the witnesses could be relied on from an astronomical point of view. A major reason why Rabban Gamliel had these maps made was to prove to the followers of Tzadok and Beyssus that he was an expert of the orbit described by the moon at any time during the month. He would predict accordingly when the end of the cycle would occur after 29 days and when it would occur after 30 days. He taught his own students how to become thoroughly familiar with the position of the moon in the sky at any time of the month, allowing also for the variations of the moon\u2019s position in the sky due to the season of the year. When he proved himself invariably correct month after month, year after year, the arguments of the opponents gradually were silenced. He still kept up the regular examinations of witnesses and they were encouraged to come forward as a reminder of the period when the matter had been a clouded issue.<br> All our sages agree that the source of investing the Sanhedrin with the authority of determining changes in the calendar goes back to Moses at Sinai, and that this authority has been used by the Sanhedrin. Any changes in rulings made in the past would have to have been authorized by another larger court superior to the original one in numbers and wisdom. The beginning of our chapter is the authority granted to Moses to determine our calendar.\n", "1": "\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, we find in connection with the redemption from Egypt 3 different dates of termination all of which relate or appear to relate to the same event. The numbers are: \u201c400 years,\u201d i.e. the prediction in Genesis chapter 15 to Avraham; we find the number 430 years in our verse here. Finally, we have the number 210 years. In order to reconcile these numbers we must remember that the number 400 refers to the time from the birth of Yitzchok.. Seeing G\u2019d\u2019s promise to Avraham concerned \u201chis descendants,\u201d any count could not begin until Avraham had such descendants, i.e. Yitzchok. G\u2019d had told him that his descendants would be known through Yitzchok, (not through Ishmael or the sons of Keturah) The number 430 begins with the date when Avraham had been told about his future by G\u2019d at the covenant between the pieces in chapter 15 in Genesis. The number 210 were the years during which Avraham\u2019s descendants were not free men living in what would become their own country in the future. During the latter 86 years of these 210 years they were cruelly enslaved and abused. During the first 124 years of their stay in Egypt, until the death of the last surviving brother of Joseph they enjoyed freedom in Egypt.<br> It is interesting that we find three dates about the redemption in the future mentioned also in the Book of Daniel. There we are told about 1) 1150 years; 2) 1290 years; 3) 1335 years. I am quoting from the first mention of redemption in Daniel 8,13-14: \u201cThen I heard a holy being speaking, and another holy being said to whomever it was he was speaking to: \u2018how long will what was seen in the vision last- the regular offering be forsaken because of transgression, the sanctuary be surrendered and the heavenly host be trampled?\u2019 He answered me: \u201cfor twenty thee hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be cleansed.\u201d Seeing that mornings and evenings were counted as separate, what are meant are half this number i.e.1150 years.<br> It is further recorded there in chapter 12,11 that from the time the regular offering had been abolished and an appalling abomination had been set up in its place it will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. Immediately after this, in verse 12 we read: \u201chappy the one who waits and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty five days.\u201d<br> It had been G\u2019d\u2019s plan that the Exodus from Egypt would be described in terms of 3 separate conclusions, extremities. The reason was that G\u2019d wanted to offer us who are awaiting the final redemption increased hope that it will eventually materialize. Having known that all three dates (prophecies) concerning the date of the redemption had come true, we would be encouraged in our faith that the promise held out in the Book of Daniel will also come true even if we appear to be at a loss to understand these numbers in advance of their becoming history. <br> One thing we can be pretty sure about: G\u2019d allowed Himself fall back positions, as He has always done since the time He created man on earth, so that if we deserve to be redeemed earlier than G\u2019d\u2019s timetable foresaw He would be able to take advantage of that number. In the Torah too, G\u2019d had not irrevocably decided beforehand that the redemption could not occur until the date it did occur, or even earlier.

However, this verse is only meant to inform us that from this year onward they would know that the date of observing the Passover will always occur on the anniversary of the Exodus. This also again proves that the calculation of the new moon does not rely on actual sightings.", "1": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05e4\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd, He led them through the desert for a different reason, apart from the fact that the route through the land of the Philistines was the most convenient one. Had He led them in that direction, and He would have convinced the Philistines to allow the Israelites free passage, based on the longstanding treaty between Yitzchak and Avimelech, G\u2019d could not have performed even a fraction of the miracles He had in mind to perform in order to strengthen the people\u2019s confidence in Him.<br> Therefore, by making the Israelites take a circuitous route, G\u2019d would be able not only to provide the people with manna, meat in the form of the quail, water produced by striking a rock, etc., etc., but the further away the Israelites would be from inhabited areas the greater would be the miracle that G\u2019d could provide for several million people all of their needs. The lesson would also be taught that even in such inhospitable regions of the earth, the human species could survive if G\u2019d wanted it so.<br> When G\u2019d saved Chanayah, Mishael, and Azaryah from the fiery furnace, G\u2019d could have saved these people by performing a far lesser miracle. However, He wanted to demonstrate His power at that time. (compare Daniel 3,27) G\u2019d did not simply extinguish the flames in the furnace, for instance, but let it roar at its fiercest in order to show that if He wanted man to survive unharmed inside such a furnace it could be done, if only G\u2019d wanted it. Or, to take the example of Daniel in the lions\u2019 den. All G\u2019d had to do was to kill the lions and Daniel would have been saved. The reason why G\u2019d went to the trouble of preventing these starved lions from making a meal out of Daniel was to demonstrate to the onlookers the extent of His control over nature. (compare Daniel 6,23).<br> Another example of the same kind is found in Judges 7,2. If G\u2019d would have allowed Gideon with 10,000 men to defeat the many times larger army of the Midianites, this would have been miracle enough. Why did G\u2019d shrink the number of soldiers at Gideon\u2019s disposal to 300? For no other reason than to make the miracle so much greater.<br> G\u2019d wanted to teach the lesson that numbers did not matter at all; what counted was that the soldiers be G\u2019d fearing men who had never bowed their knee to an alien deity. Prowess with a sword was not what was required, but lapping up water by hand and bringing it to one\u2019s mouth is what distinguishes man from the beasts who lower themselves to the water."}, "9": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d4' \u05d5\u05d1\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5. Belief consists of 4 different parts. There is belief in the Lord, as we know from Chronicles II 20,20 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05d5\u05ea\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cbelieve absolutely in the Lord your G\u2019d and you will be able to stand firm!\u201d<br>  This is the kind of belief that our verse speaks of when it reports the Israelites as \u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d4' \u05d5\u05d1\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5, they believed in the Lord and in Moses His servant.\u201d The second type of belief is the belief in the authenticity of His prophets which implies the duty to accept the prophet\u2019s instructions. We find a direct reference to this in Isaiah 53,1 \u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5? \u201cWho does believe in our assurances?\u201d The prophet speaks about the promise of there being an hereafter, demanding that we must believe in this as well as the fact that the reward for performing good deeds in this life will be forthcoming in this afterlife.

They will not be granted life in the future. This is implied by the first part of the verse from Chabakuk 2,4 we quoted already in which the prophet states \u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d5,; \u201cLo his spirit is puffed up within him not upright; but the righteous man is rewarded with life for his fidelity.\u201d"}, "10": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05dd.

The Torah characterises the master\u2019s execution as an act of \u201cavenging the servant\u201d so that everyone will be aware that he had intended to kill deliberately and the execution is the avenging of an uncalled for murder.

The proof that this could not have been what the Torah meant is verse 19 in our chapter \u05e8\u05e7 \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d9\u05ea\u05df \u05d5\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0, \u201che must only pay for his loss of income and his medical expenses.\u201d<br> If we were to do to a person who has caused the loss of another\u2019s limb exactly as he had done, why would he have to pay something in addition to that? After all, he himself loses pay due to absence from work and he also incurs medical expenses for treatment of his severed limb!?<br> Furthermore, even assuming that the Torah\u2019s words here were to be interpreted literally, not all situations are alike so that the literal application would resemble any kind of \u201ctit for tat.\u201d If the eye which a healthy person gouged out belonged to a person who had only one good eye, how would the loss of one of two good eyes by the person who caused the injury even come close to \u201cfair retribution?\u201d Not only that. Some people\u2019s constitution would not be able to survive the loss of an organ whereas others would. If a person had had a kidney ruined beyond repair by someone who only had a single kidney left, taking that person\u2019s kidney would be equivalent to a death sentence!<br> Furthermore, in Leviticus 24,19-20 we read \u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05df \u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5, \u201cjust as he has done (to another), so shall be done to him.\u201d This verse cannot be applied in any other way than the way our sages have seen fit to understand it. The thrust of the verses is to indemnify the injured party in a manner commensurate to the injury he has sustained, not by depriving him of a limb of his own. It would be physically impossible to cause a person an exact duplicate of the injury he himself has suffered. If he were to cause either a lesser or a greater injury than the one he had sustained, he would be in violation of what the Torah wrote as he would not have complied with the Torah\u2019s demand \u201cas he had done so should be done to him.\u201d In the case of monetary compensation, experts can evaluate the precise amount of the value of the loss sustained. <br> It is possible to understand the line \u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05df \u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5, as meaning: \u201cjust as he has caused harm, harm shall be caused to him.\u201d Proof of this being the meaning of the words can be found in Judges 15,11 where Shimshon said: \u201cas they have done to me so I have done to them.\u201d The dispute had begun when the Philistines had taken Shimshon\u2019s wife and in retaliation he burned their crops. Seeing that the retaliation by Shimshon did not match the harm done to him by the Philistines, it is clear that the meaning of the line is merely that harm done will be requited. Any retaliation therefore would be considered as \u201cas he has done so shall be done to him.\u201d<br> We also find that the prophet Ovadiah 15-16 prophesies concerning the future of Esau \u201cas you did so shall be done to you. Your conduct shall be requited.\u201d He goes on to spell out what precisely this involves: \u201cthe same cup that you drank from on My Holy Mount shall all nations drink evermore; drink till their speech grows thick and they become as though they had never been.\u201d I have provided you with proof based both on logic and on verses from Scripture that it is impossible to translate the line \u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e2\u05d9\u05df, as meaning \u201can eye for an eye.\u201d"}, "14": ["\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05ea\u05e8\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d1, the expression \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05ea\u05e8\u05ea reflects the activity of the thief, i.e. that he makes a practice of digging or undermining houses in the dark of night. \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05db\u05d4 \u05d5\u05de\u05ea \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, the person who killed him is not guilty of murder.

The prophet Isaiah 43,25 underlines this point when he quotes G\u2019d as saying: \u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9, \u05d0\u05e0\u05db\u05d9, \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05de\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05da, \u201cIt is I, only I, Who wipes out your transgressions.\u201d"}, "16": {"0": "\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4' \u05e0\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4.

The Israelites are also reported to have divested themselves of these blood-stained garments in Exodus 33,6. The reason why G\u2019d had chosen blood to be the symbol of this covenant was to warn the people that if they would prove loyal to the covenant everything would be fine, whereas if they would violate it, G\u2019d on His part would also make the Israelites\u2019 blood something anyone could spill without fear of Divine reprisal."}, "17": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df, the ark is a symbol of the righteous and intelligent man who is described as such only if his character qualities reflect the external image he portrays, projects.

We know that a prophet is considered as \u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7, \u201ctotally righteous,\u201d from Proverbs 8,8 \u201call the words of my mouth are with righteousness.\u201d The cherubs above the kapporet are an allusion to the angels, beings on an even higher spiritual level than the prophets. They were spreading their wings heavenward as an allusion of their striving to be near the Shechinah, which is on a higher level spiritually than the angels, seeing that the angels are the throne, (foundation of) ever ready to welcome the attribute \u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3, i.e. the attribute which occupies the throne. This is the meaning of the words in verse 20: \u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05db\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthe faces of the cherubs will be turned toward the kapporet.\u201d They had to look downwards, towards the lid and were forbidden to gaze at the Shechinah. Above everything is G\u2019d Himself as is written in Samuel II 6,2 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dd \u05d4' \u05e6\u05d1-\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cto which the Name was attached, the name of the Lord of Hosts Enthroned on the cherubs.\u201d Solomon also constructed the cherubs in the Temple out of wood, as is written (Kings I 6,23) \u201che made in the sanctuary two cherubs out of olive wood.\u201d [these wooden cherubs, ten cubits high, are not to be confused with the cherubs which are an integral part of the lid of the Holy Ark, made of solid gold, and which were in the Holy of Holies. Ed.]", "1": "\u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05df, the table represented the kings of Israel who entertain the Torah scholars at their table This is what David told his son Solomon on his death-bed: \u201cBarzilai\u2019s sons shall be among the people who are regular guests at your table. (Kings I 2,7) We also have a verse in Kings I 5,2 describing the lavishness of King Solomon\u2019s table and the quantities of food consumed on a daily basis.<br> The Torah, in describing the table in the Tabernacle as overlaid with gold, illustrates that the function of Royalty was primarily to make a great impression on the outside world. After Samuel had told Saul that he would be replaced as king by someone more worthy, Saul still begged the prophet to honour him at least in public as he wanted to maintain the appearance although he realised that this was no longer his position. (compare Samuel I 15,30).<br> The reason that the length of the table was 21/2 cubits was in order to symbolize two requirements which every king has to meet. 1) He must be competent in meting out justice; 2) he must be competent in waging war.  This is what the people had told Samuel when they asked him to appoint a king for them (Samuel I 8,20).<br> The size and height of the walls [the table did not have legs like our tables, Ed.] which amount to nine cubits cumulatively, symbolise the 9 commandments in the Torah specifically addressed to a Jewish King. 1) \u201che shall not keep many horses;\u201d 2) \u201che shall not send the people back to Egypt in order to add to his supply of horses;\u201d 3) \u201che shall not have too many wives.\u201d 4) \u201che shall not become haughty;\u201d 5) \u201che must not turn away from G\u2019d\u2019s commandments either to the left or to the right.\u201d 6) \u201che shall write for himself two copies of the Torah;\u201d 7) he shall read from the Torah every day of his life;\u201d 8) he shall not amass too much silver and gold;\u201c 9) he shall not turn away from the commandments.\u201d (Deuteronomy 17,8-20).<br> The function of the border around the surface of the table was to prevent any of the show-breads from falling off the table for whatever reason. It was intended to protect the show-breads, just as the Levites and the priests are supposed to be on guard against the king deviating from the path of the Torah. We have an example of this in Chronicles II 24,2: \u201cYoash, the king, did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Yehoyadah the High Priest was alive.\u201d In connection with King Uzziah we read in Chronicles II 26,5: \u201che applied himself to the worship of G\u2019d during the time of Zecharyah, instructor of the visions of G\u2019d.\u201d<br> All the details that the Torah writes about in connection with all the vessels of the Tabernacle contain similar allusions of a moral-ethical nature. The Ark represents the righteous people. The table corresponds to the kings of Israel. The Menorah corresponds to the scholars of Israel. The golden altar corresponds to the priests, whereas the copper altar corresponds to the people at large.

As soon as the priest had bowed down in order to offer the libation, the deputy High Priest would wave the flag cloth to signal to the Levites to begin to chant their hymns. At the time of the Mishnah, a certain ben Arza would then strike the cymbal as a further signal and the Levites would commence reciting their hymns. All the people assembled would bow down, and after each section the tekiah blast of the shofar would be blown and the trumpets would be blown until the end of the offering of the olah, the burnt offering.<br> At the end of that procedure the King and all those present with him would prostrate themselves (Chronicles II 29,28-40; compare also Tamid, 7,3.) The Levites would follow this procedure every day, varying the hymn they would sing.<br> On Sundays they would recite Psalm 24,1, seeing that this psalm deals with aspects of the creation of the universe. It recalls that everything had been void and empty before that \u201cday.\u201d The psalm concludes with the words \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3, to commemorate the directive: \u201clet there be light.\u201d The attribute \u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3 also known as Shechinah, is a great light.<br> On Mondays the Levites chanted psalm 48. In verse four of that psalm the separation between different levels of sanctity is alluded to. In the Holy Temple there were different levels of sanctity such as the \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d4, vestibule, the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holies. On the second day of creation the Torah describes the separation between the \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d waters. (Genesis 1,6). These various levels of sanctity are referred to in verse four of our psalm by the word \u05d0\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d4, \u201cits various citadels, palaces.\u201d<br> On Tuesdays the Levites would chant psalm 82 which features a verse (3) speaking about judging the poor, etc. This corresponds to the directive that all the waters in the terrestrial world were to concentrate in one area so that the dry land could become visible. (Genesis 1,9) This was an allusion for the judges to congregate when they would sit in judgment and to pronounce judgment for each individual supplicant. On that day the Torah also directed that the earth should produce trees, etc., each according to its own kind (Genesis 1,12), an allusion to the individuality, which is to be preserved on earth. When we read in that psalm that alas, man had to die, unlike the angels, the reference is to the sin committed in that garden in which all these beautiful trees had grown. This is why the psalm recited by the Levites on the fourth day, i.e. psalm 94 which commences with the reminder that G\u2019d does take revenge on those who hate Him, is appropriate for Wednesday, the day the sun and the moon were placed in orbit. The psalmist refers to people worshipping sun and moon.<br> On Thursdays the Levites used to chant psalm 81, which, amongst other matters, deals with the Exodus from Egypt. Pharaoh was compared to a sea monster, \u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05df, and on that day the great sea-monsters had been created (Genesis 1,21) &gt;br&gt; On Fridays the Levites chanted psalm 93 describing how even G\u2019d robed Himself in splendour. It was the day that man, the most accomplished of all the creatures was created, a creature combining within himself some divine attributes (created in the image of G\u2019d). He had been assigned dominion over the animals and even over nature, i.e. he was liable to similarly regard himself as sovereign in his domain on earth. Chanting that psalm then was in keeping with the significance of the day. <br> On the Sabbath the Levites chanted psalm 92, a hymn in which the righteous are described as firmly planted in the House of the Lord, a reference to the Holy Temple. It is entirely possible that there are still more allusions in these various psalms chanted by the Levites on different days of the week."}, "19": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05df \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d4\u05e8. We learn from this word \u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05df, he turned around, that Moses descended while facing the cloud just as he had done when ascending the mountain. In other words, just as he had ascended facing the cloud, he now descended keeping his face toward the cloud, walking backwards. The High Priest, on the Day of Atonement, emulated this when withdrawing from the Holy of Holies by walking backwards after having offered the incense before the lid of the Holy Ark, the kapporet, as well as some of the blood of the two offerings on behalf of the people as well as sprinkling some on the dividing curtain. We have a similar verse in Chronicles II 1,13 describing Solomon\u2019s approach to the altar that was standing in Givon at that time. Even though one could say that the words \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05de\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d2\u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05df \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05ddmean: \u201cSolomon returned from the altar in Givon to Jerusalem,\u201d [seeing Givon at that time was certainly not part of Jerusalem Ed.] the correct interpretation is that he withdrew in the same way as he had approached. The point of all this was to conform to the principle of \u05e9\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05dc\u05e0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3, \u201cI am keeping Hashem in front of Me at all times.\u201d (Psalms 16,8) One does not turn one\u2019s back on G\u2019d. The Mishnah, Yuma 52 states: \u201cin the manner he had entered he also exited.\u201d This is also the way Leviticus 16,24 describes this, writing: \u201che exited and completed the ritual of his own burnt offering as well as that of the people.\u201d These words have been interpreted by our sages to mean that the word \u05dc\u05d1\u05de\u05d4 \u201cto the altar,\u201d must also be read as \u05de\u05d1\u05de\u05d4.\u201dfrom the altar,\u201d when he was headed back to Jerusalem (Yuma 53). There is a precedent for this in Numbers 31,21, where the words \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05d4, must also mean \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05d4, \u201cthe ones who were returning from the war.\u201d How do we know that indeed the Shechinah was on the mountain at the time Moses descended? In Deuteronomy 9,15 where Moses refers to his descent from the mountain, he adds the words: \u201cand the mountain was burning in fire while the two tablets of the covenant were on my hands.\u201d We learn from all of this that the student, when taking leave of his teacher, walks backwards until the face of his teacher is no longer directly visible to him. (Yuma 53)  This is also the reason why, at the end of the principal prayer the amidah, we step three steps backwards, as if to take leave of the G\u2019d Whom we had faced and addressed before. (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim section 123).", "1": "\u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d2\u05dc, there are many different forms of idolatrous cults. Some consist of the idol having the likeness of a human being, or at least the face of a human being. Other cults worship a symbol representing the appearance of a cherub, angel-like figure. Still others worship a force symbolised by the image of certain domestic beasts, free-roaming animals, or birds. This is what we read in Kings II 17,30-31. \u201cThe Babylonians made Sukoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nirgal, and the men of Chamass made Ashima, and the Avvites made Nivchaz and Tartak. The Sepharvides burned their children to Adramelech and Anamelech, the gods of the Sepharvaim.\u201d All of these names are names of different deities. The expression Sukoth-benoth refers to a hen and her chicks; the name Nirgal refers to the rooster. The name Ashima describes a cat, whereas the name Nivchaz describes a dog. The name Tartak refers to a donkey, whereas Adramelech refers to an ape, and Adamelech refers to a peacock. I am pretty certain that the many cast idols represent stars or groups of stars in the celestial regions. This would correspond to Amos 5,26 \u201cSikkuth and Kiyun your astral deity, the images you have made for yourselves.\u201d The words Sikkuth and Kiyyun are both names of stars and are what Jeremiah 44,19 refers to when he said: \u201cand when we make offerings to the queen of Heaven and pour libations for her.\u201d The people mentioned here referred to the stars as the \u201cqueen of Heaven.\u201d The expression \u201ckiyvun tzalmeychem\u00b4 in Amos 5,26 refers to Zachal, otherwise know as Shabtai, Saturn.
