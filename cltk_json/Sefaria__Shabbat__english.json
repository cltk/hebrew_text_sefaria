Said Rabha: Because a man is anxious for his possessions, he might, if allowed to save as much as possible, forget about the Sabbath and extinguish the fire altogether. Said Abayi to him: \"We have learned previously, that a man upon whose roof a barrel filled with victuals becomes broken, may bring another vessel and put it underneath the barrel in order that the contents of the barrel fall into the vessel, but may not bring another barrel and transfer the contents of the broken one into the new, nor may he place a new barrel alongside of the other and remove the contents of the broken one into the new one by keeling over the former and letting its contents drop into the latter. Why should he not be allowed to do this? (He is on private ground, and the barrel with its contents may be handled?) If it is prohibited as a precautionary measure in the manner of the previous case, where does the precaution arise?\" This latter case is also a precautionary measure; for were he allowed to remove the contents from one barrel into another, there is fear of his carrying it through public ground. The text of the Boraitha, how ever, teaches further, that if the man had guests in his house, he may remove the contents of the broken barrel into a new one, etc. But he may not first remove the contents and then call guests, but first call guests and then remove the things; nor may he pretend (to call guests), but must actually desire their company. In the name of R. Jose bar R.

One may also save enough on the Day of Atonement in the event of a fire (when that day is succeeded by Sabbath) to last him through the Sabbath also, but on a Sabbath it is not permitted to save enough for the Day of Atonement (if the Sabbath falls on the day before), and all the more so is it not allowed if the Sabbath precedes a feast-day; nor is it allowed to save on one Sabbath for the following Sabbath.", "3": "The rabbis taught: If one forgets bread in an oven, and in the meantime the Sabbath sets in, it is allowed to save enough bread to last for three meals; and one may say to bystanders, \"Come and take out as much as ye need\"; and when taking out the bread it should not be done with a baker's shovel, hut with some other utensil.

'Hidka holds that, day being mentioned three times, three meals should be eaten during the day and one at night, and the rabbis hold that the day includes the night and only three meals are required.

If he have, however, sufficient for fourteen meals (for the week) he must not even apply to the general charity fund!\" If the Mishna were of the opinion of R. 'Hidka, he should have had sufficient for sixteen meals, so as to afford him four meals on the Sabbath, and, according to the rabbis, for fifteen meals in order to have three meals on the Sabbath? It is therefore neither in accord with R. 'Hidka nor with the rabbis. Nay; it is in accord with the rabbis, and the poor man should eat his Sabbath-night meal on the Sabbath day, so with his Friday-night meal it will make three meals on the Sabbath. It may also be said that the Mishna holds with R. 'Hidka, and that the poor man should leave his Friday meal for the Sabbath. Shall we make the poor man then fast on Friday? It would therefore be better to hold the Mishna's opinion to be in accord with R. Aqiba, who says, that the poor man should make Sabbath equal to a weekday in order not to be forced to rely upon charity. Thus fourteen meals are sufficient, and he may eat only two on Sabbath.", "6": "But according to whose opinion is the Mishna (Tract Peah): \"If a wandering mendicant come to a town, he must be given a loaf which can be bought for a Pundian (one forty-eighth of a Sela) when the price of flour is one Sela for four Saahs (and the sages calculated that such a loaf is sufficient for two meals). If he remain over night he must be given lodging, and if he remain over Sabbath he must be given three meals for Sabbath.\" Shall we assume, that this Mishna holds with the rabbis and not with R. 'Hidka? It might also be in accord with R. 'Hidka if the mendicant happen to have one meal with him, he is told to eat the one he has and is given three more.

His sons and his household are within the reasoning of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav, for Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"One is permitted to lend to his sons and his household with interest, so that they can taste the [bitter] taste of interest.\" If [we allow prohibited actions for educational purposes], pitting a larger portion against a smaller portion [should be permitted] as well [to allow them to taste the bitter taste of gambling]! Yes, indeed [that is correct], and it is missing [words], and this is how it should be taught: One can raffle off [portions] with his sons and his household for the table, even to pit a larger portion against a smaller portion.\" What is the reason? It is like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav [that this is permitted for educational purposes]. With his sons and his household, yes, but with others, no. What it the reason? Like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, \"A larger portion against a smaller portion, it is prohibited [from being raffled off] to others even during the week.\" What is the reason? Because of [the prohibition of] gambling.", "1": "\"Priests can draw lots...\"", "2": "What does it mean, \"but not for portions\"? Rav Yaakov, son of the daughter of Yaakov, said: [It means] \"but not the portions of the [previous] week's [sacrifices] on the festival.\" That's obvious! [No,] what would you have said? Since it is written, \"For your nation is like the priests who fight,\" [Hosea 4:4] even the portions of the week [should be raffled off] as well [to prevent fights]. It teaches us [that this is not so.]", "3": "And Rav Yaakov, son of the daughter of Yaakov [also] said: Anyone whose fellow gets punished because of him, is not allowed in to the borders of the Holy One, blessed be He. How do we know this? If you'll say it's because of what's written, \"And God said, 'Who will entice Achav, so he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gilad?' and one said this and one said that, and a spirit went out and stood before God, and he said, 'I will entice him'... And he said, 'I will go out and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' And He said, 'You will entice, and you will be able. Go out and do it.'\" [I Kings 22:20-22]. And we say [on that], what is this \"spirit\"? The spirit of Navot [whom Achav had killed]. And what is this \"go out\"? Rav said: \"Go out from my borders\" [thus, the spirit was banned from God's borders because he caused Achav's downfall]. But perhaps over there, the reason was because of that which is written, \"He who is deceitful shall not dwell within\" [Psalms 101:7]? Rather, [the source of Rav Yaakov's statement is] from here, \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised....\" [Habakkuk 2:16]: \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor\": That is Nevuchadnezzar. \"You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised\": That is Tzidkiyah [and since he caused Nevuchadnezzar to be punished, he is considered \"uncircumcised\"]. First of all, the whole verse is referring to Nevuchadnezzar! And furthermore, what should the righteous Tzidkiyah have done for him? For Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man\" [and thus, he was forced to punish him]! Rather, [Rav Yaakov's source is] from here, \"Punishment to the righteous is not good\" [Proverbs 17:26], \"not good\" can only mean \"wicked\", [and this applies to the righteous who punish others], and it is written, \"For You are not a God Who desires wickedness; evil does not abide with You\" [Psalms 5:5]. [Meaning], God, You are righteous, and evil shall not live in Your abode.", "4": "How does \"Chalashim\" [in the mishnah] connote \"lots\"? As it is written, \"How have you fallen from heaven, morning star? You have been cut down to earth, you who cast lots [cholesh] on nations\" [Isaiah 14:12]. Rabbah bar Rav Huna said: This teaches that [Nevuchadnezzar] would cast lots on the royal staff to figure out which day was theirs for homosexual relations. And it is written, \"All of the kings of nations, all of them... [lay in honor, each man to his house]\" [Isaiah 14:18]. Rabbi Yochanan said, \"That they rested from homosexual relations.\"", "5": "And Rabbi Yochanan said, \"As long as that wicked man lived, not a single creature had joy in its mouth, as it says, \"All the land rested, became tranquil, they opened [their mouth] in song,\" [Isaiah 14:7] implying that until now, there had not been singing.", "6": "And Rav Yitzchak said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: It is forbidden to stand in the house of that wicked man, as it says, \"...and wild goats shall dance there\" [Isaiah 13:21].", "7": "And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man, he extended his foreskin 300 cubits, and would twist it around in front of the whole party, as it says, \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised....\" [Habakkuk 2:16], \"uncircumcised\" in numerical value is 300.", "8": "And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"When that wicked man went down to hell, all the descenders of hell  trembled. They said, 'Perhaps he has come to rule over them, or to be weak like them,' as it says, \"Have you too become weak like us? Have you come to rule over us?\" [Isaiah 14:10]. A heavenly voice came out and said, \"Whom do you surpass with beauty? Go down with, and you shall be laid with the uncircumcised\" [Ezekiel 32:19].", "9": "\"How the oppressor has ceased! [How] the fury has ceased!\" [Isaiah 14:4]. Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"This nation has ceased, which had said"}, "35": {"0": "'Measure it out and bring it [as taxes].'\" And some say, '[That nation] had said, 'Bring very much, without measure.'", "1": "\"Excessive greatness was added to me\" [Daniel 4:33]. Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav Yirmiya bar Abba, this teaches that he rode on a male lion, with a snake tied to its head, to fulfill that which is said, \"And also the beasts of the field I gave to him to serve him\" [Jeremiah 27:6]", "2": "Mishna: One may not hire workers on the Sabbath, nor ask his fellow to hire workers for him. One may not wait at the \"techum\" border for nightfall [at the end of the Sabbath] so that he can hire workers for himself, nor to gather fruits [as soon as the Sabbath ends]. But one may wait till sunset in order to guard [his field], and [then] to bring in fruits with his hands. Abbah Shaul said a rule: Whatever I can say [for others to do], I can wait til sunset to do.", "3": "Gemara: What's the difference between him and his fellow? [It's obvious that if he can't, he also cannot ask his fellow!] Rav Pappa said, \"A non-Jewish fellow.\" Rav Ashi challenged, \"Asking a non-Jew [to do work on the Sabbath] is a shvut [i.e. a protective prohibition, and so this is obvious that one cannot do this as well as well]!\" Rather, Rav Ashi said, \"Even if it is a Jewish fellow, this [Mishna] is teaching us that [although] one may not ask his fellow to hire workers for him, he can [hint and] say, 'Let us see if you will stand with me in the evening.'\"", "4": "And who is the Mishna [according to]? It is like that of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha, as it is taught [in a Baraita], \"One may not [hint and] say to his fellow [on the Sabbath to hire him as a worker], 'Let us see if you will stand with me in the evening.' Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, 'One may say to his fellow, 'Let us see if you will stand with me in the evening.'\" Rabba bar Bar Chana said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"The law is like Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha.\" And Rabba bar Bar Chana said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha? Because it is written, '...by not pursuing your affairs and speaking words' [Isaiah 58:13]. Speech is prohibited. Thoughts are permitted.\"", "5": "Rav Acha bar Rav Huna asked about a contradiction to Rava, \"Did Rabbi Yochanan really say that speech is prohibited but thoughts are permitted, showing that thought is not like speech? But didn't Rabba bar Bar Chana say in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, 'It is permitted to think [in learning] in any place except for in the bathhouse and in the bathroom, [showing that thoughts are like speech, by being forbidden in some areas].'\" It is different there, for we require \"and your camp shall be holy\" [Deuteronomy 23:15], and there is not [in the case of a bathroom].", "6": "But here too it is written, \"Forbidden speech [davar] shall not be seen in you\" [showing that it is only prohibited while speaking]! That [part of the verse] is needed for that of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda said, \"One may not say the Shema reading in front of a naked gentile.\" Why [specifically] a case of a gentile? Even if it were a Jew, it would also [be forbidden]! It was a \"not necessary\" statement: It's not necessary to state that [in front] of a Jew, it is forbidden. But for a gentile, since it is written, \"[lovers] whose members were like the members of donkeys,\" [Ezekiel 23:20] I would say it would be fine [to say Shema in front of them, like it is fine to say Shema in front of a donkey.] This is teaching us [that they are considered the same]. I'll say that is indeed so [that one can say the Shema because of the verse in Ezekiel]! [Why do we dismiss it?] Scripture says, \"They did not see the nakedness of their father\" [Genesis 9:23]. [This verse refers to Noah, a gentile.]", "7": "And is speech really forbidden? But Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna both said, \"Calculations for religious purposes is permitted to be calculated on the Sabbath.\" And Rabbi Elazar said, \"One can decide on charity monies for the poor on the Sabbath.\" And Rav Yaakov bar Idi said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"One may attend [discussion of] life and death matters, and communal emergencies, and one may go to the synagogue to attend to communal matters, on the Sabbath.\" And Rav Shmuel bar Nachmeni said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"One may go to theaters, circuses, and business/legal halls to attend to communal matters on the Sabbath.\" And the school of Menashe taught, \"One may arrange marriages of young girls for engagement on the Sabbath, and for the young boy to teach the book, and to teach a trade.\" [So we see, speaking about forbidden things is allowed on the Sabbath!] Scripture says, \"...by not pursuing your affairs and speaking words\" [Isaiah 58:13], it is your affairs that are prohibited, but heavenly affairs are permitted [to talk about].", "8": "Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel, \"Calculations of the guests, and of what something [would cost], it is permissible to calculate these on the Sabbath. It was also taught like this [in a Baraita], \"Calculations of past [costs], and of what future [costs] will be, it is forbidden from calculating these. Of the guests,"}, "36": {"0": "and of what something would [cost], it is permitted to calculate these.\" And they contradicted it [from this]: One may calculate costs of unnecessary expenditures, but one may not calculate expenditures that are needed on the Sabbath. How so? One may say to his fellow, \"I have hired such and such number of workers for the field.\" \"I have spent such and such amount of dinars for this house.\" However, one may not say, \"I have spent such and such amount, and such and such amount I will spend.\" [Thus, we see that one may talk about past expenditures!] According to your own reasoning [your own source] itself is difficult! Rather, this one is when one has the wages of the employer with him, and this one is where he does not have the wages of the employer with him.", "1": "One may not wait [at the edge of the techum until nightfall]:"}, "37": {"0": "Mishnah - One should not close the eyes of a dead person on shabbat, nor on a weekday while the soul is departing.
