If he says to her before two [witnesses]: \"Do not speak with a certain man,\" and she speaks with him, she is still permitted to her house [her husband] and permitted to eat <i>Terumah</i> [if she is married to a priest].  If she meets with him secretly in a house and stays with him long enough to become impure, she is forbidden to her house [her husband] and forbidden to eat <i>Terumah</i>.

And because he had relations with the ten concubines of his father, he was pierced by ten spears, as it says: \"And ten young men who bore the arms of Joab surrounded [and smote Absalom and killed him]\" (II Samuel 18:15). And because he stole three hearts, the heart of his father, the heart of the court, and the heart of Israel, as it says: \"And Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel\" (II Samuel 15:6); therefore three darts were thrust through him, as it says: \"And he took three darts in his hand and he thrust them into the heart of Absalom\" (II Samuel 18:14).", "8": "And so it is for good things; Miriam waited for Moses for one week, as it says, \"and his sister stood by him from far away\"  (Exodus 2:4), therefore the Jewish people waited for her for a week in the desert, as it says, \"and the nation did not travel until Miriam was gathered with them\" (Numbers 12:15). Joseph merited burying his father, and none of his brothers were greater than he, as it says, \"and Joseph went up (to Israel) to bury his father...and chariots and cavalry went up with him\"  (Genesis 50:7, Genesis 50:9). Who among us was greater than Joseph, that only Moses was permitted to attend to him? Moses merited [carrying] Joseph's bones [to Israel], and none of Israel is greater than him, as it says, \"and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him\"  (Exodus 13:19).

The meal-offering of the <i>omer</i>, though it comes from barley, comes from that which was sifted, but this one comes from unsifted.

But he does not write: \"and the woman shall say 'Amen Amen'\". R. Yosi said: he does not interrupt [the text]. R. Yehuda said: he only writes, \"May God give you as a curse and as an oath\" etc. \"that these curse-causing waters will come into your intestines\" etc. And he does not write, \"and the woman shall say 'Amen Amen'\".", "3": "He may not write upon the tablet and not upon the papyrus and not upon the [unprocessed] animal hide rather upon the scroll, as it says, \"in a book\"  (Numbers 5:23).

Amen to the curse, Amen to the oath. Amen with regard to this man, Amen with regard to another man. Amen that I did not commit adultery while betrothed, or while married, or while awaiting Levirate marriage, or after being taken [to his house]. Amen that I did not become impure.

Meir said: Amen that I did not become impure, Amen that I will not become impure.", "5": "Everyone agrees that he may not stipulate with her--not about before she was betrothed and not about after she is divorced. If she secluded herself after [she was divorced], became impure, and after that he remarried her, he may not stipulate with her [about that period]. This is the rule: whenever she engaged in sexual intercourse and she was not forbidden to him, he may not stipulate with her."}, "2": {"0": "He would take her meal-offering from within the twisted basket and place it into a service-vessel, and put it into her hand. And the priest placed his hand underneath hers and waved it.", "1": "He waved and brought it near, grabbed a handful and burned it, and the remainder was fed to the priests. He gives her to drink and after that sacrificed her meal-offering. R. Shimon said: He sacrificed her meal-offering and after that gave her to drink, as it says, \"and after he shall give the woman the water to drink \" (Numbers 5:26). If  he gave her to drink and after that sacrificed her meal-offering, it is valid.", "2": "If she said, \"I will not drink [it]\" before the scroll was erased, the scroll is archived, and her meal-offering is scattered on the ashes. Additionally, her scroll is not valid to be used with (lit. \"to make drink\") another suspected-adulteress.   If the scroll was erased and she [only then] said, \"I am impure,\" the water is spilled, and her meal-offering is scattered on the ashes. [However,] if the scroll was erased and she said, \"I will not drink [it],\" we force her mouth open and make her drink against her will.", "3": "She barely finishes drinking before her face becomes green, her eyes bulge, and she [seems] filled with sinews (or \"veins\"), and they [the priests] say, \"remove her, remove her!\" so she does not defile the courtyard.  If she has merit, it [the effects described above] would be suspended for her. There is merit that suspends for one year, there is merit that suspends for two years, there is merit that suspends for three years.   From here Ben Azai says: A man is obligated to teach his daughter Torah, for if she drinks [as a suspected-adulteress], she will know that the merit suspends it for her.   Rabbi Eli'ezer says: Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is considered as if he taught her foolishness. Rabbi Yehoshua says: A woman desires a kav and foolishness more than nine kavs and abstinence. He would say: A foolish pious man, a cunning evil man, an [excessively] abstinent woman, and the self-flagellations of ascetics, all these destroy the world.", "4": "Rabbi Shimon says: Merit does not suspend [the effects of] the bitter waters. If you were to say merit suspends [the effects of] the cursing waters, you are dulling the [power of] the water before all the women who [are to] drink, and you defame the pure women who drank, since people say, \"They are in fact impure, rather merit suspended for them.\"  Rebbi says: Merit does suspend [the effects of] the cursing waters. She does not give birth nor does she improve, rather, she continuously degenerates, and in the end she dies by that very death.", "5": "[If] her meal-offering became impure before it became sanctified in a vessel, behold it is like all other meal-offerings and is redeemed. But if [it became impure] once it was sanctified in a vessel, behold it is like all other meal-offerings and is burned. These are [the cases] whose meal-offerings are burnt: One who says \"I am impure to you,\" one who witnesses have come [and said] she is impure, one who says \"I will not drink [the bitter-waters,]\" one whose husband does not want to cause her to drink, and one whose husband cohabits with her along the way [to the Temple.] Additionally, all those who are married to priests have their meal-offerings burnt.", "6": "A daughter of an Israelite who married a priest has her meal-offering burnt. [However,] A priestess who married an Israelite has her meal-offering eaten. What is the difference between a priest and a priestess? The meal-offering of a priestess is eaten, and the meal-offering of a priest is not eaten. A priestess can become profaned [lose her priestly status through an invalid marriage] and a priest cannot become profaned. A priestess may defile herself to the dead, and a priest may not defile himself to the dead.

A man lets loose his hair and rips his clothes [as a <i>metzora</i>], and a woman does not let loose her hair or rip her clothes. A man makes a vow rendering his son a Nazirite, and a woman cannot make a vow rendering her son a Nazirite. A man shaves concerning the Nazirite status of his father [if his father dies], and a woman does not shave concerning the Nazirite status of her father. A man sells his daughter, and a woman cannot sell her daughter. A man betroths his daughter, and a woman cannot betroth her daughter. A man is stoned naked, and a woman is not stoned naked.

This teaches that a loaf of second-degree impurity can make impure a loaf to the third-degree. Rabbi Yehoshua said, who will remove the dirt from your eyes Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai? You used to say that in the future another generation will purify a third-degree loaf, because there is no verse from the Torah that makes it impure.

How does it work? One-thousand cubits is for the open land, and two thousand cubits is the Sabbath border [the distance one can travel from the city on Sabbath].\" Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosi the Galilian says, one thousand cubits is for the open land, and two thousand cubits is for fields and orchards.", "3": "On that day, Rabbi Akiva expounded [the verse] \"Then Moshe and the Children of Israel sang this song to God, and they spoke, saying...\" (Exodus 15:1) It was not necessary to state, 'saying,' so what is meant by 'saying?'

When Temple was destroyed, the shamir and nopheth zufim ceased.   And people of faith ceased, as it says, \u201cHelp, O Lord, for the faithful are no more\u201d (Psalms 12:2).    Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua:  from the day the Temple was destroyed, there is no day without a curse, the dew has not descended for a blessing, and the flavor has departed from produce.  Rabbi Yose says: the fatness was also removed from produce.

During the war with Quietus they decreed against crowns worn by brides and that nobody should teach their child Greek.

When Rabbi Yose Katnuta died, the pious men (hasidim) ceased\u2014and why was his name called Katnuta? Because he was the youngest of the pious men.    When Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai died, the splendor of wisdom ceased.    When Rabban Gamaliel the elder died, the glory of the torah ceased, and purity and separateness perished.  When Rabbi Ishmael ben Fabi died, the splendor of the priesthood died.  When Rabbi died, humility and fear of sin ceased.    Rabbi Phineas ben Yair says: when Temple was destroyed, scholars and freemen were ashamed and covered their head, men of wondrous deeds were disregarded, and violent men and big talkers grew powerful.  And nobody expounds, nobody seeks, and nobody asks.   Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven.  Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: from the day the Temple was destroyed, the sages began to be like scribes, scribes like synagogue-attendants, synagogue-attendants like common people, and the common people became more and more debased.  And nobody seeks. Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven.  In the footsteps of the Messiah insolence will increase and the cost of living will go up greatly; the vine will yield its fruit, but wine will be expensive; the government will turn to heresy, and there will be no one to rebuke; the meeting-place [of scholars] will be used for licentiousness; the Galilee will be destroyed, the Gablan will be desolated, and the dwellers on the frontier will go about [begging] from place to place without anyone to take pity on them; the wisdom of the learned will rot, those who fear sin will be despised, and the truth will be lacking; youths will put old men to shame, the old will stand up in the presence of the young, \u201cFor son spurns father, daughter rises up against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law\u2014a man\u2019s own household are his enemies\u201d (Micah 7:6).

Pinchas ben Yair says:  Quickness leads to cleanliness, cleanliness leads to purity, purity leads to separation, separation leads to sanctity, sanctity leads to humility, humility leads to fear of sin, fear of sin leads to piety, piety leads to the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit leads to the resuscitation of the dead, and the the resuscitation of the dead leads to the coming of Elijah, may he be remembered for good, Amen.

The elders of that city bring \u201ca heifer which has never been worked, which has never been yoked\u201d (Deuteronomy 21:3). And a blemish does not disqualify it.

But did we really think that the elders of the court are shedders of blood!  Rather, he did not come to us and we dismissed him without supplying him with food and we did not see him and let him go without escort.   Then the priests exclaim, \u201cAbsolve, O Lord, Your people Israel, whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among your people Israel\u201d (vs. 8).   They did not need to say, \u201cAnd they will be absolved of bloodguilt\u201d (ibid), rather the Holy Spirit announces to them, \u201cWhen you act in this way, the blood is forgiven you.\u201d ", "6": "If the murderer was discovered before the heifer\u2019s neck was broken, it goes free and grazes with the herd;  But if after the heifer\u2019s neck was broken, it is buried in that place because it came there from the outset in connection with a matter of doubt, and atoned for the doubt which is now gone.
