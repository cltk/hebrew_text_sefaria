Akiva holds that since he knew for a certainty that he had become unclean, even though the specific type of uncleanliness \u2014 sheretz or neveilah \u2014 is not known to him, he is liable. And both (R. Eliezer and R. Akiva) exempt him for hiddenness of sanctuary, and R. Yishmael holds him liable. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yishmael.]"}, "2": {"0": "\tOaths are two, which are four: I swear that I shall eat, or that I shall not eat [These are the two which are explicitly written. Viz.

These are the words of R. Akiva. They asked him: Where do we find that one who eats any amount is liable, that this one should be liable! He countered: And where do we find that one who speaks brings an offering [for breaking his word] that this one should speak and bring an offering! [And since it is because of breaking his word (that he is liable), this, too, is breaking his word. For when one says \"I shall not eat,\" he means any amount.] \"I swear that I shall not eat,\" and he ate and drank, he is liable only for one (offering). [Even though drinking is included in eating, he is liable only for one, for it is as if he eats, and eats again, in one act of forgetfulness.] \"I swear that I shall not eat and that I shall not drink,\" and he ate and drank, he is liable for two. [This constitutes two oaths. And even though when he said \"I shall not eat,\" drinking (too) was forbidden to him, drinking being included in eating, so that when he then said \"I shall not drink,\" there is reason to say that one oath does not \"take\" on another (of the same kind), it is different here. For since he first said \"I shall not eat,\" and then, \"I shall not drink,\" it is made manifest that by \"eat\" he meant eating alone.]", "1": "\t\"I swear that I shall not eat,\" and he ate a loaf of wheat, and a loaf of barley, and a loaf of spelt, he is liable only for one. \"I swear that I shall not eat a loaf of wheat, and a loaf of barley, and a loaf of spelt,\" and he ate, he is liable for each one. [His repeating \"loaf,\" \"loaf,\" indicates that he intended a distinct oath for each. For if he intended no more than to forbid these kinds to himself and no more, he would have said \"a loaf of wheat, and also of barley, and also of spelt.\"]", "2": "\t\"I swear that I shall not drink,\" and he drank many (different kinds of) drinks, he is liable only for one. \"I swear that I shall not drink wine, and oil, and honey,\" and he drank, he is liable for each one. [The Gemara construes this as an instance of one's urging him: \"Come and drink with me wine, oil, and honey.\" (If he intended one oath,) he would have said \"I swear I shall not drink with you,\" and no more, the oath applying to what was being urged upon him. Why \"wine, oil, and honey,\" if not to render them distinct?]", "3": "\t\"I swear that I shall not eat,\" and he ate things which are not fit for eating and drank things which are not fit for drinking, he is not liable. \"I swear that I shall not eat,\" and he ate carrion and treifoth, forbidden animals and reptiles, he is liable. [For they are fit for eating; it is just that the Torah forbids them.] R. Shimon rules not liable. [For he is already besworn (by the Torah) against them. And the dispute between R. Shimon and the first tanna obtains where he includes permitted things with forbidden ones, as where he says \"I swear that I shall not eat slaughtered meat and treifoth.\" The first tanna holds that since the oath \"takes\" with slaughtered meat, it also takes with treifoth, for one prohibition takes effect upon another in the instance of an inclusive prohibition. And R. Shimon holds that it does not. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] If one says: \"I bevow my wife benefit from me if I have eaten today,\" and he had eaten carrion and treifoth, forbidden animals and reptiles, his wife is forbidden (to benefit from him). [For he had eaten foods. And even R. Shimon (agrees in this.) For the reason he rules not liable in the first instance is not that they are unfit for eating but because an oath does not take on something forbidden.]", "4": "\t(He is liable) both for things that relate to himself and for things that relate to others, [as follows: \"I shall give to that man, etc.\"], both for things of substance and for things lacking substance. [Two types are implied: Things like sleeping and things devoid of benefit, e.g. \"I shall throw a stone into the sea.\"] How so? I swear that I shall give that man or that I shall not give. That I have given or that I have not given. That I shall sleep or that I shall not sleep. That I have slept or that I have not slept. That I shall throw a rock into the sea or that I shall not throw. That I have thrown or that I have not thrown. R. Yishmael says: He is liable only for the future, it being written (Leviticus 5:4): \"to do ill or to do good.\" R. Akiva said to him: If so (he should be liable) only for things involving ill or good. Whence do I derive (that he is also liable for) things not involving ill or good? He answered: From the amplification of the verse, [(Ibid.): \"\u2026for all that a man will pronounce.\"] R. Akiva: If the verse was amplified for this (i.e., all things), it was also amplified for that (i.e., to include the past). [The (rationale) of the dispute between R. Akiva and R. Yishmael: In all the Torah, R. Akiva expounds amplification and limitation, and R. Yishmael, general and particular. R. Akiva expounds: \"Or if a soul swear\" \u2014 amplification; \"to do ill or to do good\" \u2014 limitation; \"for all that a man will pronounce\" \u2014 reversion to amplification. Amplification - limitation - amplification \u2014 Everything is included. What is included? All past things are included (for oath liability) just as future (things are indicated.) And what is excluded? Oaths involving mitzvoth. And R. Yishmael expounds: \"Or if a soul swear\" \u2014 general; \"to do ill or to do good\" \u2014 particular; \"for all that a man will pronounce\" \u2014 reversion to general. General - particular - general \u2014 What is derived must accord with the nature of the particular. Just as the particular is explicitly in future state, so all must be in future state.

If he swore to fulfill it, but did not do so, he is not liable [by reason of an oath of pronouncement, but he is liable by reason of a vain oath.] For according to R. Yehudah b. Betheira he should be liable [by reason of an oath of pronouncement.] (For) R. Yehudah b. Betheira said: Now if with something optional, for which he is not besworn from Mount Sinai, he is liable for it \u2014 a mitzvah, for which he is besworn from Mount Sinai, does it not follow that he should be liable for it! They said to him: No, it is so with an oath for something optional, where not doing is equated with doing, [it being written \"to do ill or to do good,\" implying something which may either be done or not done], as opposed to an oath for a mitzvah, where not doing is not equated with doing, so that if he swears to refrain from doing and does not do so, he should not be liable.

I swear that I shall not eat it,\" and he ate it, he is liable only for one. [The reason that he is liable only for one is that the (second) oath does not \"take\" on the first. But if he first said: \"I shall not eat it,\" and then: \"I shall not eat,\" and he ate the whole thing, he is liable for two. For when he says: \"I shall not eat it,\" he is not liable until he eats the whole thing, and when he then says: \"I shall not eat,\" once he eats an olive-size of it, he is liable. Therefore, the second oath takes, and he is liable when he eats an olive-size of it. And when he then eats the whole thing, he is liable by reason of the first oath. (\"I swear that I shall not eat it. I swear that I shall not eat it\":) Even though the second oath, \"I shall not eat it,\" is enough to apprise us that one oath does not \"take\" on the other, the third is still taught to apprise us that even though there is no liability for the latter oaths, they are nonetheless oaths, and not vain words, and if they can \"find a place,\" they take effect. For if a sage absolves him of the first, the second takes effect and it is forbidden to him by reason of the second oath. Likewise, if he is absolved of the first two, the third takes effect. For the sage uproots the vow completely, so that it is as if he had never vowed, and the second \"takes\" retroactively, the first being regarded as non-existent once he has been absolved of it.] This is an oath of pronouncement, where for willful transgression one is liable to stripes, and for unwitting transgression, to an oleh veyored offering. With a vain oath, for willful transgression one is liable to stripes, and for unwitting transgression, he is not liable.", "7": "\tWhich is a vain oath?

If he does not eat it, he transgresses an oath of pronouncement as well. For when he swears \"I shall eat this loaf,\" he is obliged to eat it. So that when he then swears \"I shall not eat it,\" he is swearing not to perform a mitzvah, and he receives stripes by reason of a vain oath whether he does or does not eat it.

[Therefore, he is denying money. The (rationale of the) dispute between the rabbis and R. Shimon: R.

[For it is like one's claiming wheat and barley, and the other admitting one of them. The halachah is in accordance with Admon, but it is not in accordance with R. Gamliel, who rules that there is liability with a claim of wheat and an admission of barley.] The sages say that the admission is not of the \"kind\" of the claim. R. Gamliel said: \"I see (i.e., concur with) the words of Admon.\" If he claimed vessels and land, and the other admitted vessels and denied land, (or he admitted) land and denied vessels, he is exempt[from a Torah mandated oath.

[The Torah did not mandate that the claimant swear and take, but that the claimee swear and not pay, it being written (Exodus 22:10): \"And its master shall take it, and he shall not pay\" \u2014 He who is being asked to pay takes the oath.] And these swear and take [The sages ordained that they swear and take. They are all explained later in the Mishnah:] a hired laborer, one who has been robbed, one who has been struck, one whose opposite is not trusted to take an oath, and a shopkeeper over his ledger. A hired laborer \u2014 how so? [The sages ordained that a hired laborer swear and take; for the employer is busy with his workers and may not remember. This, when he claims within the prescribed time: a day-laborer, all of the night following, and a night-laborer, all of the day following. But if he claimed after his time, the employer takes a shvuath heseth that he paid him and he is exempt. Also, if he did not hire him in the presence of witnesses, the hired laborer does not swear and take. For since he can tell him: \"I never hired you,\" he can also tell him: \"I hired you and I paid you.\"] If he said to him: \"Give me the pay that you owe me\" \u2014 If the other said: \"I gave it to you,\" and he: \"I did not receive it,\" he (the hired laborer) swears and takes it. [But if the laborer said to him: \"You stipulated that you would give me two,\" and the employer: \"I stipulated only one,\" the employer swears a Torah mandated oath that it is as he says, and he gives him only one.] R. Yehudah says: (He does not swear) unless there is partial admission. How so? As when he said: \"Give me my pay, fifty dinars, that you owe me,\" and the other said: \"You received a golden dinar (twenty-five silver dinars).\" [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah, neither in the instance of a hired laborer, nor in that of one who has been robbed or beaten.]", "1": "\tOne who has been robbed \u2014 how so? If they testified against him that he entered the other's house to take a pledge from him without being authorized to do so, [as when witnesses saw him enter the other's house with nothing in his hand and he left with vessels projecting from the folds of his garment] \u2014 He says: \"You took my vessels\"; the other says: \"I did not,\" he (the claimant) swears and takes. [For the indications are (that he did steal). For the witnesses testify that he took a pledge without authorization. This, when he claims something which he is likely to own, but if he claims \"a silver chalice,\" or the like, which he is not likely to own, it is not for him to swear and take (in all instances), but the claimee swears and exempts himself.] R. Yehudah says: (He does not swear) unless there is partial admission. How so? As when he said: \"You took two vessels,\" and the other said: \"I took only one.\"", "2": "\tOne who has been struck \u2014 how so? If they testified that he went into him whole and came out with a wound, and he said: \"You struck me,\" and the other said: \"I did not,\" he (the claimant) swears and takes (compensation). [This, only where the wound is in a place where it could have been self-inflicted, for which reason an oath is required. But where this is not possible, and it is evident that another must have caused it, as when tooth marks appear on his back and no one else (but the accused) was there, he collects without an oath.] R. Yehudah says: (He does not swear) unless there is partial admission. How so? As when he said: \"You struck me twice,\" and the other said: \"I struck you only once.\"", "3": "\tOne whose opposite is not trusted to take an oath \u2014 how so? (The other swears) whether (his opposite had transgressed in) an oath of testimony, or in an oath over a pledge, or even with a vain oath. [i.e., Not only where he has transgressed in an oath of testimony or in an oath over a pledge, where there is denial of money \u2014 \"evil to Heaven and evil to man\" \u2014 but even with a vain oath, where there is only evil to Heaven, his opposite swears and takes. An oath of pronouncement is not included, for it may be future-directed, such as \"I shall eat\" or \"I shall not eat,\" where the oath is a truthful one, his intent being to fulfill it, so that even though he is overcome by his evil inclination and transgresses, this does not render him not trusted to take an oath. But an oath of pronouncement concerning the past, such as \"I ate\" or \"I did not eat,\" is like a vain oath, for he swears falsely.] If one of them were a gambler, or a lender on interest, or a pigeon-flyer, or a dealer in [the fruits of] the sabbatical year (shevi'ith), his opposite swears and takes. [(If one of them were, etc.\":) First those unfit by Torah law are taught, and then those who are unfit by rabbinical ordinance. (\"a pigeon-flyer\":) some understand this as: \"If your pigeon comes in before mine, I will give you so much and so much,\" i.e., gambling. Others understand it as training a pigeon to fly other pigeons to one's coop, this being \"theft in violation of the ways of peace.\" (\"a dealer in shevi'ith\":) It is written (Leviticus 25:6): \"to eat\" \u2014 and not for trade.] If both of them were suspect (i.e., not trusted to swear), the oath returns to its place. These are the words of R. Yossi. [In the Gemara, some explain this as \"it returns to Sinai,\" i.e., to the oath of Mount Sinai, where the Holy One Blessed be He beswore Israel: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" and He will exact payment from the one who denies it to his neighbor; but beth-din need not resort either to oath or to (enforcement of) payment. And others explain it as: \"it returns to the one who is liable to it,\" i.e., the one who admits part; and since he is not trusted to swear, he pays.] R. Meir says: They divide.", "4": "\tAnd a shopkeeper over his ledger \u2014 how so? Not that he says to him: \"Write in my ledger that you owe me a hundred zuz,\" but (we are speaking of an instance in which) he said to him (the shopkeeper): \"Give my son two sa'ah of wheat,\" or \"Give my workers change of a sela.\" He says: \"I gave,\" and they say: \"We did not receive,\" he swears and takes, and they swear and take (from the employer). [For the shopkeeper says to him: \"I do not trust the workers to take an oath. You trusted them for you did not tell me to give it to them in the presence of witnesses.\" And the workers, likewise, say to the shopkeeper: \"We do not trust you to swear.\" And when they both swear and take from the employer, they swear before each other, so that either the shopkeeper (will be deterred) by shame before the workers, or the workers before the shopkeeper.] Ben Naness said: How can this be done? These will utter a vain oath or those will utter a vain oath! [For, perforce, one will swear falsely, and the Name of Heaven will be desecrated.] Rather, he takes without an oath and they take without an oath. [The halachah is not in accordance with Ben Naness.]", "5": "\tIf he said to the shopkeeper: \"Give me fruits for a dinar,\" and he gave them to him, [and the fruits are piled in the public domain, with neither of them in possession] \u2014 If he said: \"Give me the dinar,\" and the other said: \"I gave it to you, and you put it in your money-bag,\" the customer swears, [an oath similar to that of the Torah, and he takes (the fruits). For since the shopkeeper admits that he made the sale and the fruits are outside his shop, the customer swears and takes.] If he gave him the dinar and said: \"Give me the fruits,\" and he said: \"I gave them to you and you took them home, [and these piled up fruits are mine; I put them here to sell.\" And the other: \"These are the fruits that you sold me for a dinar,\" since the buyer admits the sale, and the shopkeeper denies having sold these], the shopkeeper swears an oath similar to that of the Torah and he takes (the fruits). R. Yehudah says: Whoever has possession of the fruits has the upper hand. [R. Yehudah differs with the last ruling, saying that in both cases the customer swears and takes. For since the fruits are outside the shop, it is as if they are in the customer's hand. And whoever has possession of the fruits has the upper hand, and he swears and takes.] If he said to a moneychanger: \"Give me change of a dinar,\" and he gave it to him \u2014 If he said to him: \"Give me your dinar,\" and he said to him: \"I gave it to you and you put it in your money-bag,\" the customer swears. If he gave him the dinar and he said: \"Give me the change,\" and he said: \"I gave it to you and you threw it into your pouch,\" the moneychanger swears. R. Yehudah says: It is not the way of a moneychanger to give an issar (small coin) before he takes the dinar. [The tanna apprises us of the difference between R. Yehudah and the rabbis both in respect to the change of the moneychanger and the fruits of the shopkeeper. For if he apprised us only of the latter, I might think that it is only with fruits that the rabbis said that if he said: \"I gave them to you and you took them home,\" the shopkeeper swears and takes, for a shopkeeper is wont to give the fruits before he takes the dinar; but with a moneychanger, who is not wont to give issarin before he takes the dinar, perhaps they would concur with R. Yehudah that the customer always swears and takes. And if he apprised us only of the former, I might think that the customer always swears and takes because the moneychanger is not wont to give issarin before he takes the dinar; but with a shopkeeper, who is wont to give the fruit before he takes the money, I might say that he concurs with the rabbis. We must, therefore, be apprised of both. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]", "6": "\tJust as they said (Kethuvoth 9:7) that a woman who \"impairs\" her kethubah [i.e., who produces her kethubah and admits that she has received partial payment] exacts payment only with an oath [if her husband claims that she has received the whole], and that if one witness testifies that it has been paid, she exacts payment only with an oath, and (that if she came to claim her kethubah) from bound property or from the property of the orphans, she exacts payment only with an oath, or that if she is paid not in his (her husband's) presence, she exacts payment only with an oath [(All revert to \"Just as\" (above), i.e., Just as none of these exacts payment without an oath)], so the orphans exact payment only with an oath. That is, orphans who exact payment from other orphans do so only with an oath. Our Mishnah speaks of an instance where the orphans who are being asked to pay say: We do not know whether or not our father paid this debt. But if they claim: Our father told us that he never borrowed this money and had never incurred this debt, then the orphans who produce the bill against the others exact payment without an oath. For saying \"I did not borrow\" is tantamount to saying \"I did not pay,\" and they cannot refute the witnesses who testify that their father did borrow this money. And we are taught that with an oath these orphans do exact payment from the others only in an instance where the creditor died in the debtor's lifetime; but if the debtor died in the creditor's lifetime, the creditor is already obliged to swear to the sons of the debtor that he received nothing. For one who exacts payment from orphans, even with a bill (of indebtedness) must swear. And one does not bequeath to his sons money for which he is obliged to swear, the sons not being able to take an oath for which their father is liable. But though this is the halachah, if a judge ruled that the orphans swear \"Our father did not charge us, etc.\" in order to exact payment from the other orphans thereby, what is done is done.[ (What is the oath?) \"We swear that father did not charge us [at the time of his death], and did not inform us [before that time, that the bill was paid], and we did not find among our father's bills (any indication) that this bill was paid.\" R. Yochanan b. B'roka says: Even if the son was born after the father's death, he swears and takes. [He swears that he did not find among his father's bills (any indication) that this bill was paid. This is the halachah.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel said: If there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death: \"This bill has not been paid,\" he (the son) takes without swearing. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.]", "7": "\tAnd these swear without a [definite] claim(against them) [but only with a tentative one, i.e., \"Is it possible that you withheld something of mine?\" And because all of these (that follow) are inclined to rationalize (appropriating things for themselves) in that they exert themselves with the property, the rabbis imposed an oath upon them]: partners, tenant-farmers, caretakers, [who manage one's money for him. But with a caretaker of orphans \u2014 if beth-din appoints him he swears; if the father of the orphans appoints him, he does not swear.], a woman who carries on trade in the house, [her husband having made her a shopkeeper or a caretaker for his property], and a \"son of the house\" [one of the brothers, who deals with the property after the father's death.] If he asks: \"What are you claiming from me\"? (and the other replies:) \"I want you to swear to me,\" he is liable (to do so). If the partners or the tenant-farmers divided [and did not make him swear at the time of the division], they cannot make him swear [thereafter]. If an oath were \"rolled on\" to him [by them, afterwards], for something else, they can \"roll\" everything [including this] upon him. [And just as \"rolling on\" obtains with a Torah mandated oath, and with an oath similar to a Torah oath, so does it obtain with a shvuath heseth.] And shevi'ith (the sabbatical year) \"releases\" the oath.
