Our Rabbis, however, (taking this word in the sense of animals) gave the following explanation: they have been compared to the beasts of the field which do not require the help of midwives. And where are they compared to animals? (Genesis 49:9) \u201cJudah is a young lion\u201d; (Genesis 27) \u201cBenjamin is a wolf that leareth\u201d; (Deuteronomy 33:17) \u201cJoseph is the firstling of his ox\u201d; (Genesis 49:21) \u201cNaphtali is a hind sent forth\u201d. As for the ancestors of those tribes about whom such a comparison is not expressly written Scripture implicitly includes them in the several blessings bestowed upon their brothers, (and thus they also are compared, as their brothers, to animals), for Scripture states, (Genesis 49:28) \u201cAnd he blessed them etc.\u201d (cf. Rashi on these words). Then, again, it is written, (Ezekiel 19:2) \u201cHow was thy mother a lioness!\u201d (The prophet is addressing the princes of Israel as the representatives of the people, and by the term \u201cthy mother\u201d means the progenitors of the nation; the chapter proceeds to speak of the mother\u2019s offspring as \u201cwhelps\u201d)."}, "19": {"0": " \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05d9\u05d8\u05b8\u05d1 means HE DID GOOD TO THEM. \u2014 The following is the difference between certain forms in a word (verb) whose root is two letters when one prefixes \u05d5 and \u05d9 to them: when it intends to express the meaning \u201cand he caused someone or something to do a particular action\u201d (i. e. the 3rd masc. sing, imperf. Hiphil with Vau conversive), the \u05d9 has the vowel Tz\u00e9r\u00e9 which is what we call Kametz Katan, as, (in this verse) \u201cAnd God dealt well (\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b6\u05d9\u05d8\u05b8\u05d1) with the midwives\u201d (to Rashi the root it \u05d8\u05d1; we take it as \u05d9\u05d8\u05d1); (Lamentations 2:5) \u201c\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1 for the daughter of Judah [mourning]\u201d i. e. He increased (made great) the mourning; (root \u05e8\u05b9\u05d1; we take it as \u05e8\u05d1\u05d4). Similarly (II Chronicles 36:20) \u201c\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b8\u05d2\u05b8\u05dc the remnant\u201d which occurs in connection with Nebuzaradon, i. e. he caused the remnant to be exiled; (Judges 15:4) \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b8\u05e4\u05b8\u05df tail to tail\u201d, i. e. he turned the tails one towards the other (more lit., he caused one tail to turn to the other) \u2014 all these express the meaning \u201che caused others to do something\u201d (i. e. they are of the Hiphil conjugation). When, however, it speaks in the sense of \u201cand he did something\u201d (3rd masc. sing, imperf. Kal with Vau conv.), the \u05d9 has the vowel Chirik. For example, (Leviticus 10:20) \u201c\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b7\u05d1 in his eyes\u201d \u2014 this means, \u201cit was good\u201d. Similarly (in this verse) the people\u201d, i. e. the people became many; (2 Kings 25:21) \u201c\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05d2\u05b8\u05dc Judah\u201d, i. e. Judah became an exile; (2:12) \u201c\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05e4\u05b5\u05df this way and that way\u201d, i. e. he turned this way and that way.

This teaches regarding the seventh day of the Passover that it is not obligatory to eat unleavened bread on it, but only this is required viz., that one should not eat leavened food. Whence may we derive that the other six days, too, are optinal as regards the eating of unleavened bread? From what Scripture states: \u201cSix days [shalt thou eat unnleavened bread]\u201d. For the following is a Rule by which the Torah may be expounded: Anything that is included in a general statement and goes out (i. e. Scripture singles it out) from this general statement for the purpose of teaching something, does not go out from it in order to teach something regarding itself alone but it goes out from it to teach something about everything that is included in the general statement. Now the seventh day is included in the general statement \u201cSeven days shall ye eat unleavened bread\u201d, and in the text \u201cSix days shall thou eat unleavened bread\u201d it has left the general statement. How is it with the seventh day? It is optional as regards the eating of unleavened bread, (as explained in the earlier portion of this comment)! This, according to the above rule, applies also to everything that was included in the general statement i. e. to the whole seven days, and therefore the other six days are also optional in this respect! One might think that the first night of the Passover is also optional (since it is part of the first day when as we have just shown the eating of unleavened bread is optional), therefore Scripture states, (v. 18) \u201cat evening ye shall eat unleavened bread\u201d Scripture thus fixes it as obligatory for that night.", "2": " \u05d0\u05da \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 EVEN THE FIRST DAY YE SHALL HAVE PUT AWAY LEAVEN \u2014 This means on the eve of the festival ye shall put it away \u2014 and that day is termed \u201cthe first (\u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df) day\u201d because it is immediately before the seven days: We find in another passage, too, that a thing which precedes another is termed \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, as in (Job. 15:7) \u201cWast thou born \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df Adam\u201d, i. e. wast thou born before Adam? \u2014 But perhaps the text it referring only to the first of the seven days (i. e. the word \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df has its ordinary meaning of first, and leavened food must be removed on the first day of the Festival and not on the preceding day)!

So, too, the term \u201c[leaven in all] your boundaries\u201d means only such leaven as is in your boundaries and under your control, thereby excluding such leaven belonging to a non-Israelite as is deposited with an Israelite but for which he has accepted no responsibility (Mekhilta).", "1": " \u05db\u05d9 \u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d7\u05de\u05e6\u05ea FOR WHOSOEVER EATETH THAT WHICH LEAVENETH \u2014 The purpose of this statement is to mention the punishment of excision for eating \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 (a synonym for \u05de\u05d7\u05de\u05e6\u05ea, which is something that causes the leavening process to set in, such as yeast etc., whilst \u05d7\u05de\u05e5 denotes food which has become leavened).

With regard to (1 Kings 11:7) \u05d0\u05d6 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05d4 our Rabbis explained that He proposed to build a high place for Chemosh but actually did not build it (Sanhedrin 91b). This, too, teaches us that the \u05d9 as a prefix of the imperfect is used in reference to intention to do a thing. This explanation serves to settle the literal meaning of the text. But so far as its Midrashic explanation is concerned our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: from here (i. e. from the fact that the future tense is used) we may derive an intimation that the tenet of the Resurrection of the Dead is from the Torah (is alluded to, although only by inference, in the Torah) (Sanhedrin 91b). And thus, also, do they explain in the case of all them (all of the examples quoted) except in the case of that referring to Solomon which they explained in the sense that he purposed to build a high place but did not build it. \u2014 One cannot say that this can be appropriately explained in the same way as one explains other passages which are written in the future tense, but which really refer to an immediate action (i. e. to a then present time); for example, (Job. 1:5) \u201cThus was Job doing (\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4)\u201d; (Numbers 9:18) \u201cAt the command of the Lord were they encamping (\u05d9\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5)\u201d; (Numbers 9:20) \u201cAnd there were occasions when the cloud was (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4) upon the tabernacle\u201d, because these were each of them something that was continuously happening, and there is proper to it either the future tense or the past tense (cf. Rashi on Genesis 29:3). But this (\u05d0\u05d6 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 and other passages quoted) which happened only at the particular moment mentioned (once and once only), one cannot fittingly explain in this sense (i. e. of continuous action).", "1": " \u05db\u05d9 \u05d2\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d0\u05d4 FOR HE IS GLORIOUSLY SUBLIME \u2014 render this as the Targum does: for He is exalted above all exalted beings and real exaltation (supremity) is His alone. [Another explanation: the repetition of the word is intended to state that He has done something which it is impossible for a human being (lit., flesh and blood) to do. When he (the latter) fights against another and vanquishes him he throws him off the horse, but here \u2014 horse and its rider together hath He hurled into the sea. The usage is, that in the case of everything which cannot possibly be done by anyone except Him the appropriate expression to use is a form of the root \u05d2\u05d0\u05d4, as in (Isaiah 12:5), \u201cfor He hath done \u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u201d \u2014 gloriously. In the same way you will find that throughout the whole Song the words are repeated: (v. 2) \u201cThe strength and vengeance of the Lord have become my help\u201d; (v. 4). \u201cThe Lord is a man of war, the Lord is His name\u201d (cf. Rashi\u2019s explanation of this), and this is the case in all the verses]. Another explanation of \u05db\u05d9 \u05d2\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d0\u05d4: I will sing unto the Lord although (\u05db\u05d9) He is exalted high above all songs and however much I may praise Him there will still remain something additional in Him to be praised (\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d9\u05e9 \u05d1\u05d5 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05ea \u2014 I can never exhaust his praises), and not as is the practice in respect to a human king whom one praises, attributing to him certain virtues whilst these are really not in him.", "2": " \u05e1\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d5\u05e8\u05db\u05d1\u05d5 THE HORSE AND ITS RIDER \u2014 both of them attached one to the other; and the waters lifted them up and then they descended into the depths and yet they did not become separated (Mekhilta).", "3": " \u05e8\u05de\u05d4 means HE HATH CAST. Similar is (Daniel 3:21) \u201cand they were cast (\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05d5) into the midst of the fiery furnace\u201d. And an Agadic explanation is: One verse says \u05e8\u05de\u05d4, which involves the idea of raising (\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd), and another verse (v. 4) says, \u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 which implies casting from a height (cf. Rashi on \u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 19:13)! This teaches us that they first went up on high and then went down into the depths (i. e. they were tossed up and down). The meaning of \u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 here is the same as in (Job. 38:6) \u201cWho laid (\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4) the corner-stone thereof?\u201d \u2014 implying laying from above to below (Mekhilta)."}, "1": {"0": " \u05e2\u05d6\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4 \u2014 Onkelos translated this by \u201cmy might and my praise\u201d, taking \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 the same as \u05e2\u05bb\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9, and \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05ea the same as \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9. But I wonder at the wording of the text if this translation is correct, for you will find no similar example of its punctuation (i. e. of \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9) in the Scriptures except in three passages where it is, in each case, followed by \u05d5\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea. In all other passages it is punctuated with \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7 (i. e. our Kibbutz); e. g., (Jeremiah 16:19) \u05d4' \u05e2\u05bb\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d5\u05de\u05e2\u05d6\u05d9 (Psalms 59:10) \u05e2\u05bb\u05d6\u05bc\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05da \u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d4 So, too, every word of two letters that is punctuated with a Melopum (our \u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) when it is lengthened by the addition of a third letter (i. e. when it has a pronominal suffix as in the examples given below), and the second has not a Sheva (\u05d7\u05d8\u05e3), the first is punctuated with a \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7 (Kibbuts) \u2014 as, for instance, \u05e2\u05b9\u05d6 and \u05e2\u05bb\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9; \u200e\u05e8\u05b9\u05e7 and \u200e\u05e8\u05bb\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9 ; \u200e\u05d7\u05b9\u05e7 and \u200e\u05d7\u05bb\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9 ; \u200e\u05e2\u05b9\u05dc and \u05e2\u05bb\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9 as in (Isaiah 14:25) \u201cthen shall his yoke (\u05e2\u05bb\u05dc\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9, from \u05e2\u05b9\u05dc) depart from him\u201d; \u2014 \u05db\u05b9\u05bc\u05dc and \u05db\u05bc\u05bb\u05dc\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9, as in (Exodus 14:7) \u201cand captains over each of them (\u05db\u05bc\u05bb\u05dc\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9) \u2014 from \u05db\u05bc\u05b9\u05dc. But these three examples of \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05ea, viz., that occuring here and that in Isaiah (12:2) and that in Psalms (118:14), are punctuated with short Kametz, whereas the translation of Onkelos would require \u05e2\u05bb\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 and not \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9. Then further, in not one of them (these three passages) is it written \u05d5\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9, as Onkelos translates, but \u05d5\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea and remarkably enough all of them are immediately followed by \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4. \u2014 Therefore I say in explanation of the wording of the text that \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 is not the same as \u05e2\u05bb\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 and \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05ea is not the same as \u05d5\u05b0\u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9, but \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 is a noun without a suffix of any kind, as we find in (Psalms 123:1) \u201cThe one who sits (\u05d4\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9) in heaven\u201d; (Obadiah 3:3) \u201cThe one who dwells (\u05e9\u05c1\u05b9\u05db\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9) in the cleft of the rock\u201d; (Deuteronomy 33:16) \u201cHe that dwelleth (\u05e9\u05c1\u05b9\u05db\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9) in the bush\u201d (where the syllable at the end of the word is part of the noun and is not the pronominal suffix denoting \u201cmy\u201d). The praise, therefore, proclaimed in these words is this: The \u05e2\u05d6 and the \u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05ea of God, this was to me as a help. The word \u05d5\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea is a noun in the construct state to the word which expressess the Divine Name (\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4\u05bc), in the same sense as (Judges 5:23) \u201cto the help of (\u05dc\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05b7\u05ea \u2014 const.) the Lord\u201d; (Isaiah 9:18) \u201cthrough the wrath of (\u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea \u2014 constr.) the Lord\u201d; (Ecc. 3:18) \u201cbecause of (\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05b7\u05ea \u2014 const.) the sons of man\u201d. The expression \u05d5\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea has the meaning of the root which we find in (Leviticus 25:4) \u201cthou shalt not prune (\u05ea\u05d6\u05de\u05e8)\u201d and in (Isaiah 25:5) \u201cthe cutting down (\u05d6\u05de\u05d9\u05e8) of the terrible ones\u201d, both of which have the meaning \u201clopping off\u201d and \u201ccutting down\u201d. Thus the verse signifies: \u201cThe strength and vengeance of our God has become to us a help\u201d. Do not be puzzled by the expression \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u2014 that it does not state \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u2014 for we have other verses also that use this idiom, and the following is an example of such a construction: (1 Kings 6:5) \u201cround about the wall of the house, both of the temple and the most holy place, he made (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9) a side structure\u201d, and it should have said (instead of \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9 etc.) \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05e6\u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1. Similarly in Chronicles, (2 10:17) \u201cBut as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned (\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05dc\u05da) over them\u201d, where it should have said \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd. Other examples are: (Numbers 14:16) \u201cBecause the Lord was unable etc\u2026. He slaughtered them (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d7\u05d8\u05dd)\u201d, where it should have said \u05e9\u05d7\u05d8\u05dd; (Numbers 14:36, 37) \u201cAnd the men whom Moses sent \u2026 they died (\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05ea\u05d5)\u201d, where it should have said \u05de\u05ea\u05d5; (Exodus 9:21) \u201cAnd he that regarded not the word of the Lord left (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05d6\u05d1) his cattle, etc.\u201d, where it should have said \u05e2\u05d6\u05d1\u200e.", "1": " \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 THIS IS MY GOD \u2014 In His glory did He reveal Himself to them and they pointed to Him \u2014 as it were \u2014 with the finger exclaiming \u201cThis is my God!\u201d A maid servant beheld at the Red Sea what even the prophets never saw (Mekhilta). ", "2": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5 Onkelos translates this in the sense of a dwelling (viz., I will build Him a temple) as in (Isaiah 33:20) \u201ca peaceful habitation (\u05e0\u05d5\u05d4)\u201d and in (Isaiah 65:10) \u201ca dwelling (\u05e0\u05d5\u05d4) for flocks\u201d. Another explanation of \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5 is that it has the sense of \u05e0\u05d5\u05d9, \u201cbeauty\u201d, and the meaning is: I will relate His splendour and praiseworthiness to the inhabitants of the world as, for example, was actually done by Israel: (Song 5:9, 10) The nations of the world ask, \u201cWhat is thy beloved more than another beloved?\u201d \u2026 and Israel replies, \u201cMy beloved is white and ruddy\u201d, and thus you will find it in that whole section (cf.

Thus, also, every \u05d4 which is a root-letter (a letter in the primary form of the noun) is changed into a \u05ea when it is joined to another letter.

And wherever \u05d0\u05e3 and \u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05df (i. e. where \u05d0\u05e3 and words formed from the same root as \u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05df) occur in the Scriptures I say that it has the following sense: In the phrase \u05d7\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e3 the first word is the same as (Job 30:30) \u201cMy bone is \u05d7\u05e8\u05d4 with heat\u201d, where \u05d7\u05e8\u05d4 denotes burning and glowing, and this metaphor is used because the nostrils become hot and burning in a time of anger. The noun \u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05df is a derivation of \u05d7\u05e8\u05d4, just as \u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05df is a derivation of \u05e8\u05e6\u05d4, and therefore signifies \u201cburning\u201d. In the same way, \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05d4 which also signifies wrath really denotes heat (from a root \u05d9\u05d7\u05dd, not \u05d7\u05de\u05dd, since the \u05de of \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 has no Dagesh. \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 is formed from \u05d9\u05d7\u05dd as \u05e2\u05b5\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4, congregation, from \u05d9\u05e2\u05d3). That is why Scripture says, (Esther 1:12) \u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5 \u201chis wrath burned in him\u201d, and when one\u2019s wrath subsides one says, \u201chis mind has become cooled\u201d (\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7\u05e8\u05e8\u05d4 from \u05e7\u05e8 cold).", "1": " \u05e0\u05e2\u05e8\u05de\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05dd THE WATERS WERE HEAPED UP \u2014 Onkelos translated this in the sense of \u05e2\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea, subtlety (the waters showed themselves clever); (cf. \u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd Genesis 3:1); but it is more in accordance with the elegance of Biblical style to take it as the noun of the same root as in (Song 7:3) \u201ca stack of (\u05e2\u05e8\u05de\u05ea) wheat\u201d, and the following words, \u201cthe floods placed themselves like a mound\u201d, prove that this is so (cf.

Now do not say that the expression \u201cemptiness\u201d in these examples does not apply to the thing which comes out, but that it applies to the scabbard and the sack and the vessels from which these things come out and not to the sword and to the wine (it is the scabbard, the sack and the vessels which are empty not the sword, the corn and the wine), \u2014 and consequently give a forced explanation of \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 in the sense of the verb in (Genesis 14:14) \u201cHe armed (\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7) his trained servants\u201d, saying that it means, \u201cI will arm myself with my sword\u201d, for we do, indeed, find the expression \u201cempty\u201d applied also to the thing which, comes out of a receptacle; e. g., (Song 1:3) \u201coil which is emptied (\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7)\u201d; (Jeremiah 48:11) \u201cit (the wine) hath not been emptied (\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7) from vessel to vessel\u201d.

It means the morrow after he (Moses) descended from the Mount Sinai, and you must admit that it is impossible to say that this was any other day but the morrow after the Day of Atonement because, before the giving of the Torah, one could not say, (v. 16) \u201cand I do make them know the statutes [of God and His laws]\u201d (which are part of the Torah), and from the day when the Torah was given until the Day of Atonement Moses did not sit down to judge the people, since immediately after the Torah was given he ascended the mountain and descended only on the seventeenth of Tammuz when he broke the tablets in pieces. On the next day he again ascended the mountain early in the morning and stayed there eighty days, descending on the Day of Atonement (cf. Tanchuma \u05db\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d0, Rashi on 33:11, Deuteronomy 9:18 and 10:1).

For even according to the view of one who says that Jethro came to Moses before the giving of the Torah his dismissal into his own land did not take place until the second year, for it is stated here (v. 27) \u201cMoses let his father-in-law go\u201d, and we find in the account of Israel\u2019s journey through the wilderness beneath their banners (which according to Numbers 10:11 began in the second year) that Moses said to him, (Numbers 10:29, 31) \u201cWe are journeying etc\u2026. Forsake us not, I pray thee\u201d. Now if this incident happened before the giving of the Torah (including Jethro\u2019s departure) where do we find it related that he returned after he had let him go and he had taken departure? And if you object that there (in the section in Numbers which Rashi has quoted as evidence that Jethro\u2019s departure took place in the second year) it does not mention Jethro at all but Hobab, and that the latter was not Jethro but the son of Jethro, then I reply that Hobab is identical with Jethro and not his son, because it is written, (Judges 4:11) \u201cof the sons of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses\u201d.", "1": " \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05f3 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05de\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd MOSES SAT \u2026 AND THE PEOPLE STOOD He was sitting like a king and they all stood, and the thing was distasteful to Jethro in that he made light of the respect due to Israel.

The reason of this it, because the altar is created (its purpose is) to lengthen man\u2019s days and iron has been created (one of its purposes is) to shorten man\u2019s days, it is not right that an object which shortens man\u2019s life should be lifted up above that which lengthens it (Mekhilta, Middoth 3:4).

Now, the following statement follows logically, \u00e0 fortiori: How is it in the case of stones which cannot see nor hear nor speak? Because that they promote peace Scripture ordains, \u201cThou shalt not lift up against them any iron tool!\u201d Then in the case of one who makes peace between a man and his wife, between family and family, between a man and his fellow, how much more certain is it that punishment will not come upon him (Mekhilta)."}, "22": {"0": " \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea AND THOU SHALT NOT GO UP BY STEPS [TO MY ALTAR] \u2014 When thou buildest an ascent to the altar thou shalt not construct it of steps, \u00e9chelons in old French, but it shall be even (i. e. the surface shall be unbroken) and sloping (cf.

Now the following statement follows logically \u00e0 fortiori: How is it in the case of stones which have no sense (feeling) to be particular about any disrespect shown to them? Scripture ordains that since they serve some useful purpose you should not treat them in a manner that implies disrespect!

For if the \u05e0 is not a root-letter, then seeing that it (the word \u05d5\u05e0\u05e6\u05dc\u05ea\u05dd) is vowelled with Chirik, it cannot be used in the sense of \u201cand ye shall do something\u201d (the active voice, which is required here since \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd can only be the object of the verb), but in the sense of \u201cand ye shall have something done to you\u201d (the passive \u2014 \u201cNiphal\u201d), as (Deuteronomy 28:63) \u201cAnd ye shall be plucked up (\u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05e1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d7\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05dd) from off your land\u201d; (Leviticus 26:25) \u201cand ye shall be given (\u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05bc\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05dd) into the hand of the enemy\u201d; (Leviticus 17) \u201cAnd ye shall be smitten (\u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d2\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b8\u05dd) before your enemies\u201d; (Ezekiel 22:21) \u201cAnd ye shall be melted (\u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05ea\u05bc\u05b7\u05db\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05dd) in the midst thereof\u201d; (Jeremiah 7:10) \u201cAnd ye say, \u05e0\u05b4\u05e6\u05bc\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u201d \u2014 which expresses the idea \u201cwe have had something done to us\u201d (the Niphal: we have been delivered). Then again, every \u05e0 which sometimes appears in a word and sometimes is omitted, as e. g. the \u05e0 of \u05e0\u05d5\u05d2\u05e3 and \u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 and \u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05df and \u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05da, when the word expresses the sense \u201cand ye shall do something\u201d (the Kal), it is pointed with vocal Sheva (\u05d7\u05d8\u05e3 a \u201csnatched\u201d sound), as, for instance, (Genesis 45:19) \u201cand ye shall bear (\u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05d0\u05ea\u05b8\u05dd) your father\u201d; (Numbers 32:29) \u201cAnd ye shall give (\u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05ea\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05dd) them the land of Gilead\u201d; (Genesis 17:11) \u201cAnd ye shall circumcise (\u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05dd) the flesh of your foreskin\u201d. Consequently I am of the opinion that this letter \u05e0 which is vowelled with a Chirik is one of the root letters, and the grammatical form of the noun of the same root is \u05e0\u05b4\u05e6\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc which is of the strong (dageshed) forms, just as \u05d3\u05bc\u05b4\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 and \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05e4\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 and \u05dc\u05b4\u05de\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3. When, in the case of verbs formed from these roots one expresses the idea of \u201cand ye shall do something\u201d (active voice) the \u05e0 has the vowel Chirik (i. e. it is the Piel conjugation), as (Numbers 20:8) \u201cAnd ye shall speak (\u05d5\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05dd) unto the rock\u201d; (Ezekiel 45:20) \u201cAnd ye shall atone (\u05d5\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05b4\u05e4\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b6\u05dd) for the house\u201d; (Deuteronomy 11:19) \u201cAnd ye shall teach (\u05d5\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05de\u05bc\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b8\u05dd) them unto your children\u201d."}, "3": {}, "4": {"0": " \u05e9\u05dc means DRAW OFF and take off.

Or perhaps this is not so, but Scripture is referring to the case of one who sells himself as a servant on account of his destitution, whilst he who has been sold by the court for his theft shall not go free at the end of six years! This assumption it erroneous, for when Scripture states, (Leviticus 25:39, 40) \u201cand if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and he sells himself unto thee \u2026 [he shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee]\u201d, it is plain that in this passage there is mentioned the case of one who sells himself on account of his destitution.

What is this additional way of acquiring freedom? This verse teaches you that she goes free also on account of having shown signs of incipient puberty: but she must stay with him until she reaches this stage of incipient puberty. For that she goes free if the termination of the six years happened to come before the signs of incipient puberty we have already learned, since it is said, (Deuteronomy 15:12) ,\u2018[and if thy brother], an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman [be sold unto thee], and serve thee six years [then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee]\u201d (cf. Rashi v. 7). What then must be the meaning of what is stated here, \u201cshe shall go out for nothing\u201d? That when the signs of incipient puberty appear before the six years are at end she shall go out on account of them. Or perhaps Scripture states here that she shall go free only when she has reached the intermediate stage of womenhood (\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, fuller development after twelve years and a half), if this stage happened to be reached before the termination of the six years! To teach this Scripture states \u201cwithout money\u201d \u2014 which would be superfluous since it has already said \u201cshe shall go out \u05d7\u05e0\u05dd\u201d \u2014 in order to add as another date of her acquiring freedom the time of her reaching this stage of womanhood. And though it necessarily follows that she goes free an reaching the state of \u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea since her freedom is brought about even by the earlier stage of \u05e0\u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea yet if Scripture had not used both terms (both \u05d7\u05e0\u05dd and \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05db\u05e1\u05e3), I might have said that \u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e0\u05dd refers to the stage of womanhood; therefore both expressions are used in order to give a disputant no opportunity to offer a different explanation (i. e.

Since it is said, (Leviticus 24:17) \u201cAnd the man that smiteth (\u05d9\u05db\u05d4) any person (more lit., the soul of any human being) [shall surely be put to death]\u201d, I might have inferred that mere smiting without resultant death is subject to the death penalty. Scripture therefore states here, \u201cWhosoever smiteth a man so that he die [shall surely be put to death]\u201d, thus telling you that he is not punishable with death unless the stroke proves fatal. On the other hand if it had stated here, \u201cWhosoever smiteth a man\u2026\u201d and it had not said there \u201cIf a man smiteth [any person]\u201d, I might have inferred that the murderer is not guilty except if he killed \u201ca man\u201d; whence, however, could I know that he is subject to the death penalty if he killed a woman or a minor? Therefore Scripture states \u201cAnd if [a man] smiteth any person\u201d, thus including even a minor and a woman. Then again: if it had stated only, \u201cWhosoever smiteth a man\u201d I might have inferred that even a minor who smote and killed a person is punishable with death. Scripture therefore states \u201cand if a man smiteth\u201d \u2014 a man but not a minor. Then on the other hand, so far as concerns the statement \u201cAnd if [a man] smiteth the soul of any man\u201d it might be held that even premature births at a term of eight months are included in the term \u05db\u05dc \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u201csoul of any man\u201d, Scripture therefore states \u201cWhosoever smiteth a man\u201d to intimate that one is not subject to the death penalty unless he kills a viable child \u2014 one which is fitted to become a man."}, "12": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d4 AND IF A MAN LIE NOT IN WAIT \u2014 i. e. if he did not lie in ambush for him (the person whom he killed), nor did he premeditate the blow (Makkot 7b).", "1": "\u05e6\u05d3\u05d4 is a term denoting \u201clying in wait\u201d; similarly it says, (I Samuel 24:12) \u201cyet thou liest in wait (\u05e6\u05d3\u05d4) for my soul to take it\u201d. It is, however, not correct to say that \u05e6\u05d3\u05d4 is of the same derivation as, (Genesis 27:34) \u05d4\u05e6\u05d3 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3 \u201che that hath hunted (\u05d4\u05e6\u05d3) venison\u201d, for a \u05d4 has no place in the verbal forms of the term denoting \u201chunting beasts\u201d. Then again, the noun form of the latter is \u05e6\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05d3 and that of the former \u05e6\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4, whilst the participle of the verb \u201clying in wait\u201d is \u05e6\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u05b6\u05d4 and that of the other is \u05e6\u05b8\u05d3. I therefore say that its meaning is as the Targum gives it: \u201cand if he did not lie in ambush for him\u201d. Menachem ben Seruk placed it in the same section as \u05d4\u05e6\u05d3 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3 (i. e. he held that the root is \u05e6\u05d3 and that it has the meaning of \u201chunting\u201d), but I do not agree with him. If it is to be placed in one of the sections of \u05e6\u05d3 we had better place it in the same section as, (Isaiah 66:12) \u05e2\u05dc \u05e6\u05d3 \u05ea\u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5 \u201cye shall be borne upon her side (\u05e6\u05d3)\u201d and (I Samuel 20:20) \u201cand I will shoot [three arrows] on the side thereof (\u05e6\u05d3\u05d4)\u201d, and (Daniel 7:25) \u201cand he shall speak towards the side of (against) the Most High\u201d. Thus, here, the words \u05d0\u05e9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d4 could be taken to mean, \u201che did not turn aside (\u05e6\u05b4\u05d3\u05bc\u05b5\u05d3)\u201d to seek some side (occasion) for killing him.

About two men, one of whom killed a person with premeditation and the other killed inadvertently, and in neither case were there witnesses to the deed who could testify about it. Consequently, the former was not put to death and the latter was not forced into banishment to a city of refuge (cf. Numbers 35:11). Now God brings them together at the same inn. He who killed with premeditation happens to sit beneath a ladder, and the other who killed inadvertently ascends the ladder and falls, when descending it, upon the man who killed with premeditation and kills him. Witnesses now being present they testify against him, so compelling him to be banished to one of the cities of refuge. The result is that he who killed inadvertently is actually banished and he who killed with premeditation actually suffers death (cf.

Whence do I know that this is also the case if he has stolen a woman? Therefore Scripture states, (Deuteronomy 24:7) \u201c[If a man be found] stealing any person [he shall be put to death]\u201d.

Or perhaps you might say that also of animals which were of unequal value when living Scripture states that both of them must be halved! But if you say this, you will find that sometimes the man who occasions the damage may benefit considerably \u2014 namely, when the carcass is worth when sold unto heathens much more than the value of the ox which inflicted the injury.

Or it may sometimes happen that the claimant will receive much more than the value of the whole damage \u2014 namely, when one-half of the value of the defendant\u2019s ox is worth more than the whole value of the claimant\u2019s ox. Consequently if you still maintain this (that the animals are to be halved even when they are of different value), the result may well be that the case of the \u05ea\u05dd is more severely dealt with than that of the \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 (when the claimant gets full damages \u2014 but not more). You must therefore needs admit that Scripture speaks here only of animals that are of equal value, and that it teaches you that the owner of a \u05ea\u05dd has to pay half damages; and from what is said in respect to animals of equal value you may derive the law in respect of such as are of different values \u2014 that in any case when a person is paid half the damages caused to him we value the carcass for him (the claimant); and as regards the depreciation in value caused by its death \u2014 he must accept a sum equal to half of that depreciation together with the carcass and has to be satisfied (Hebrew: and goes his way). But why does Scripture use this mode of expression and does not simply say: he (the owner of the \u05ea\u05dd) shall pay the half? To teach you by the way that the \u05ea\u05dd pays only to the extent of its own value (Hebrew: from what can be obtained for its body). So in case it gores another and itself dies, the claimant gets at most the carcass of the ox that caused the damage, and if that does not amount to one-half of the damage, he has to suffer the loss. Or take another case: an ox of the value of one maneh (200 zuz) that gored an ox of the value of 500 zuz (so that the loss is more than the whole value of the ox that caused it). The claimant still does not get more than the living ox; and the defendant is not bound to make up the deficiency from his own money, for the \u05ea\u05dd is not responsible to such an extent as to make its owner liable to pay from his own property)."}, "35": {"0": " \u05d0\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 means, OR it was not a \u05ea\u05dd but IT IS KNOWN THAT THE OX WAS WONT TO THRUST to-day yesterday and the day before yesterday \u2014 thus you have the three acts of goring required to make it a \u05e9\u05dc\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05dc\u05dd \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 ", "1": ".\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 HE SHALL SURELY PAY AN OX [FOR THE OX] \u2014 i. e. the full damage.", "2": " \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5 AND THE DEAD SHALL BELONG TO HIM \u2014 to the claimant as part of this full payment.

If this be so, what is the purpose of Scripture stating here \u201c[to the door] or to the doorpost\u201d? By this juxtaposition it only compares the door with the doorpost. What is the characteristic of the doorpost? It is something perpendicular!

Or perhaps this is not so, but Scripture means his left ear? Scripture however uses the term \u05d0\u05d6\u05df here and it uses \u05d0\u05d6\u05df in another passage, thereby suggesting an analogy based upon verbal similarity; viz., here it is said \u201cand his lord shall bore his ear (\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d5) through\u201d, and of the leper it is said, (Leviticus 14:25) \u201cand the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear (\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05ea) of him that is to be cleansed\u201d. \u2014 How is it in that latter passage? It is the right ear! So here, too, it is the right ear. \u2014 What is the reason that the ear had to be pierced rather than any other limb of the servant\u2019s body? Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai said: That ear which heard on Mount Sinai, (Exodus 20:13) \u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d and yet its owner went and stole and was therefore sold as a slave \u2014 let it be pierced! Or, in the case of him who sold himself from destitution, having committed no theft, the reason is: That ear which heard on Mount Sinai what I said, (Leviticus 25:55) \u201cFor unto Me the children Israel are servants\u201d and yet its owner went and procured for himself another master \u2014 let it be pierced! (Mekhilta; Kiddushin 22b). Rabbi Simeon interpreted this verse like a jewel (i. e. giving it an ethical signification): In what respect are door and doorpost different from all other objects in the house that they should be singled out for this purpose? God, in effect, said: door and doorpost that were eye-witnesses in Egypt when I passed over the lintel and the two doorposts, freeing Israel from slavery, and when I said, (Leviticus 25:55) \u201cFor unto Me the children of Israel are servants\u201d \u2014 servants to Me but not servants of servants (of human beings), and yet this man went and procured another master for himself \u2014 let him be pieced in their presence (i. e. let them be eye-witnesses now when this man voluntarily prolongs his state of slavery)!

Or, perhaps this is not so, but \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd means for ever as is its usual meaning? Scripture however, states, (Leviticus 25:10) \u201c[And ye shall sanctify the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof] and ye shall return every man unto his family\u201d. A comparison of these two passages tells us that a period of fifty years is termed \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd. This does not, however, imply that he has to serve him a whole period of fifty years, but that he has to serve him until the year of the Jubilee (the fiftieth year) whether this be close at hand or far ahead (Kiddushin 15a; Mekhilta)."}, "6": {"0": " \u05d5\u05db\u05d9 \u05d9\u05de\u05db\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05d4 AND IF A MAN SELL HIS DAUGHTER TO BE A MAIDSERVANT \u2014 The text speaks of a minor daughter (under 12 years of age).

You must admit, however, that the \u00e0 fortiori argument applies: How is it in the case of a woman who was sold at an earlier age (as a minor)? She goes free on showing signs of incipient puberty, as it is said, (v. 11) \u201cthen shall she go out free without money\u201d, which law we explain to refer to a woman who has showed such signs during the period of slavery!

Whichsoever of these periods comes first brings her freedom first. \u2014 He (the master), however, has to pay her the value of her eye or the value of her tooth. \u2014 Or perhaps this is not so, but, \u201cshe shall not go out as the men-servants do,\u201d means she shall not go free as the Hebrew menservants do, viz., at the end of six years or at the Jubilee? Scripture, however, states, (Deuteronomy 15:12) And if thy brother, an Hebrew man or an Hebrew woman be sold unto thee\u201d, comparing the Hebrew woman with the Hebrew man in regard to all reasons for departure (i. e. also with regard to her going free in the Jubilee, for that she goes free in the seventh year is stated in the text just quoted). How is it in the case of a Hebrew man? He goes free at the end of six years and at the Jubilee! So, too, does the Hebrew woman go free at the end of six years and at the Jubilee. What then do these words mean: \u201cshe shall not go out as the menservants do\u201d? They mean: she shall not go free in consequence of the loss of one of \u201cthe tips of her limbs\u201d (i. e. the ends of limbs that project from the body) (cf. Mishna Negaim 6:7) inflicted by the master, as the Canaanitish servants do when they that lose \u201cthe tips of their limbs\u201d (Mekhilta; Kiddushin 20a). Incidentally I may add that you might think that the Hebrew manservant shall go free in consequence of loss of one of the tips of his limbs and that only the Hebrew maidservant differs in this respect from the Canaanitish servant, since Scripture expressly specified her in the words: she shall not go out free etc. Scripture, however, states \u201can Hebrew man or an Hebrew woman\u201d thereby comparing the Hebrew man with the Hebrew woman. What is the case with the Hebrew woman? She does not go free in consequence of loss of one of \u201cthe tips of her limbs\u201d! So, too, the Hebrew man does not go free as compensation for the injury inflicted on one of \u201cthe tips of his limbs\u201d (cf. Mekhilta)."}, "7": {"0": " \u05d0\u05dd \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4 IF SHE BE EVIL IN THE EYES OF HER LORD \u2014 i. e. that she did not find favour in his eyes so that he might be induced to marry her (cf.

They derive from here that we must not decide a person\u2019s guilt by a preponderance of one judge. And the end of the verse they explained thus: \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05ea \u2014 but if the judges who declare the defendant guilty are two more than those who declare him innocent, then decide the matter as they declare \u2014 that he is guilty (Sanhedrin 2a). \u2014 The verse, they point out, speaks of capital cases. \u2014 The middle passage \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e8\u05d1, they explained as though it were written \u05e2\u05dc \u05e8\u05b7\u05d1, \u201cthou shalt not speak against the chief of the judges, meaning that one should not give an opinion different from that given by the \u05de\u05d5\u05e4\u05dc\u05d0 of the court (the most eminent among the judges, because this is disrespectful to the Presiding-judge). In consequence of this rule we begin to take the view of those in the side-benches first \u2014 we ask the youngest judges to express their opinion first (so that they may not be able to vote against the view expressed by the \u05de\u05d5\u05e4\u05dc\u05d0). Therefore the exegesis of the verse according to the words of our Rabbis is as follows: \u201cthou shalt not follow a bare majority for evil\u201d \u2014 to sentence a man to death on account of the one judge by whom those who condemn him are more in number than those who acquit him; \u201cand thou shalt not speak against the chief inclining away\u201d from his opinion. \u2014 They explained this latter phrase thus, because the word which is usually written \u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1 is here written without and therefore may be read, \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05ea \u2014 ;\u05e8\u05b7\u05d1, there is, however, a majority to whose view thou must incline. When is this the case? When there are two who preponderate amongst those who vote for condemnation over and above those who vote for acquittal. For from what is implied in, \u201cthou shalt not follow a bare majority for evil\u201d, I may infer: but thou shall follow it for good. Hence they (the Rabbis) said (i. e. they established the general rule): In capital cases we may decide by a majority of one for acquittal, but only by a majority of at least two to condemn. Onkelos translates the second phrase by: Do not refrain from teaching when you are being asked your opinion in a legal matter. The Hebrew text is to be explained according to the Targum as follows: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05e0\u05d8\u05ea If you are being asked your opinion in a legal matter do not give your answer just to incline to one particular side and so to withdraw yourself from the dispute, but decide the matter as truth requires.

The bread was shaped like a case broken open as regards two of its sides (two opposite sides of which have been removed; these are what we would call the front and the back). It had a bottom underneath, but no top, and this bottom was turned up on both ends to form, as it were, walls.

The bread was placed lengthwise across the breadth of the table with its sides standing up exactly in a line with the edge of the table. There were made for it a golden mould and an iron mould: in the iron one it was baked, and when it was taken out from the oven it was put on the golden one until the next day, the Sabbath, when it was arranged on the table (the mould then being removed). This golden mould is here called \u05e7\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 (Menachot 94a; cf. also Berliner\u2019s Rashi 2nd ed. p. 426).", "1": " \u05d5\u05db\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 AND ITS SPOONS \u2014 ladles (or rather, cups with flat bottoms) in which the incense was put.

They were notched in five places, one above the other, and the ends of the canes which were between one loaf and another were supported on these notches so that the weight of the upper loaves should not press heavily upon the lower ones in which event these would be broken.

Thus the upper and lower bolts were two which were made up of four. As to the middle bolt its length was equal to that of the entire wall passing from one end of the wall to the other end, for it is said, \u201cAnd the middle bolt etc. shall reach from extremity to extremity.\u201d This was therefore in one piece, and so we have the five of which this passage speaks.

The bolts were \u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd i. e. placed at three equidistant points along the ten cubits that formed the height of the board, thus dividing the height into four equal portions, \u2014 one portion extending from the upper ring to the top of the board, another from the lower ring to the bottom, each portion being a quarter of the board\u2019s height, and the other two portions were between the rings (from one ring to the central bolt and from there to the other ring). This was done in order that all the rings in one row should be exactly opposite one another so that the bolt could be easily inserted. The middle bolt, however, had no rings, but the) wards were grooved right through their thickness and it (the middle bolt) passed through them by way of these grooves which were exactly opposite one another (all in one straight line). This is the meaning of what is stated, \u201c[and the middle bolt] in the midst of the boards.\u201d The upper two and the lower two bolts on the north and south side were each 15 cubits long, whilst the middle bolt was 30 cubits long.

Of the five bolts on the west side the length of the two upper and the two lower ones was each six cubits whilst the middle one hade its length twelve cubits corresponding to the aggregate width of the eight boards (each of which was one cubit and a half).

These were fixed close to each ring on both sides of it. The length of the two staples filled up the space along the width of the board, one extending from the ring in this direction, the other from it (the ring) again in the other direction.

The Tabernacle was thirty cubits in length from East to West, for it is said, (Exodus 36:23) \u201ctwenty boards for the south side (which was the long side of the Tabernacle) southward,\u201d and the same is stated with reference to the north side; and as each board was one cubit and a half in breadth you have thirty cubits from East to West. The width of the Tabernacle from North to South was ten cubits, for it is said, (Exodus 36:27, 28) \u201cand for the side of the dwelling westward he made six boards \u2026 and two boards \u2026 for the corners of the dwelling,\u201d so you have ten cubits (this appears to give a breadth of twelve cubits, but each of the corner boards stood partly behind the thickness of the adjoining board that stood at right angles with it, and as the thickness was one cubit it took off a cubit on each side from the inside measurement). \u2014 I shall explain these verses each on its place. \u2014 They spread the curtains with their length over the breadth of the Tabernacle, whereby the ten middle cubits served as a roofing for the inside over the width of the Tabernacle and a cubit on each side of these ten cubits went to cover the thickness of the boards which were one cubit thick, so that there remained altogether sixteen cubits \u2014 eight hanging over on the north side and eight on the south side, covering the vertical boards which were ten cubits in height; consequently the two lowest cubits of the boards were left showing. The breadth of the curtains after having been joined together was forty cubits, twenty cubits for each section. Thirty cubits of these served as a roofing for the inside of the Tabernacle over its length, and one cubit for the thickness of the tops of the boards of the westside and one more cubit to cover the thickness of the columns in the east side \u2014 for there were no boards in the east side but there were five columns on the hooks of which the screen was spread and hung as a kind of curtain (cf. Exodus 27:10). Thus there remained eight cubits which hung on the back of the Tabernacle on the west side, leaving the two lowest cubits showing. This I have found in the Boraitha \u05de\"\u05d8 \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea. But in Treatise Sabbath (8b) it is stated that the curtains did not cover the thickness of the columns on the east side, and consequently there were nine cubits of the curtains hanging on the back of the Tabernacle. The text of this section suppports this view, since it says (v. 33) \u201cand thou shalt hang up the partition veil under the catches;\u201d for if it were as the Boraitha states the partition veil would have been distant from the catches one cubit to the West."}, "5": {"0": " \u05e7\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1 CATCHES OF GOLD \u2014 Fermels in old French They put one end of them into the loops on one section and the other end into the loops on the other section and they thus joined them (these sections) together by means of them."}, "6": {"0": " \u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2\u05ea \u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd CURTAINS OF \u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd \u2014 i. e.

This is similar to the practice of making rounded grooves in the boards that form the sides of chests and wooden chairs. For the altar too he made a hollowing round about \u2014 its width was a cubit \u2014 in its wall for ornamentation. It was made at the end of three cubits of its height (measuring from the top of the altar). This is according to the view of him who says (cf. v. 1): its (the altar's) height was twice its length. And if you ask how, then, can I explain the statement, \u201cand the height thereof shall be three cubits\u201d I reply, that this gives the measurement from the edge of the surround upwards. This surround served only as an ornamentation, but a surround for the priests to walk upon when officiating the copper altar had only on its top within its horns (running from one horn to the other). Thus we read in Treatise Zevachim (62a): What is the \u05db\u05e8\u05db\u05d1? The sunken space between one horn of the altar and the other, this being a cubit in width, and, from that space inward (towards the centre of the altar) a space of another cubit upon which the priests could walk right round the altar, thus making a surround two cubits in width. These two cubits were called \u05db\u05e8\u05db\u05d1. The criticism is there made to this definition: But is it not written, \u201c[and thou shalt put it (the grate)] under the compass of the altar beneath\u201d \u2014 which statement teaches us that the \u05db\u05e8\u05db\u05d1 was on the side of the altar and not on its top since the covering formed by the grate was beneath it? Whereupon the Talmud replies (lit., the replier replies), that in fact there were two surrounds, one for ornamentation (that below) and another (on the top) for the priests that they should not slip off when walking round. The one on the side of the altar was intended for ornamentation, and beneath it they put the grate as a covering and its width reached to the middle of its (the altar\u2019s) height, measuring this from the ground. It also served to mark the middle of its height separating the two halves of the altars side upon which were put respectively the sacrifical blood which had to be sprinkled above (on the upper part; this was the blood of a \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea) and the blood which had to be sprinkled below (that of \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 ,\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05dd and \u05d0\u05e9\u05dd). Corresponding to this there was made for the altar in the \u201cEternal House\u201d (the Temple at Jerusalem) a sign consisting of a red line (Zevachim 53a; Middoth 3:1). As to the ascent (\u05db\u05d1\u05e9 \u2014 the inclined plane) upon which they went up to the top of the altar, it is true that Scripture does not expressly mention it in this section but we have it already implied in the statement in the section beginning with the words \u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9 (Exodus 20:21\u201423): \u201cThou shalt not go up by steps [unto my altar]\u201d \u2014 i. e. thou shalt not make steps on its ascent, but thou shalt make an unbroken ascent, \u2014 this tells us that it had such an ascent. \u2014 So do we read in the Mechilta (to Exodus 20:23). \u2014 For the altar of earth there spoken of is identical with the altar of copper described here and it was called an altar of earth because they used to fill the hollow space within it (within its coppered walls) with earth at every place where they encamped in the wilderness. This ascent was on the south of the altar, its top standing away from the altar just a hair\u2019s breadth (i. e. almost touching the altar). Its foot reached to the cubit adjacent to the hangings of the court on the south, (i. e. it was one cubit distant from those hangings of the enclosure). This latter statement is according to him who holds that its height (that of the altar) was ten cubits, whilst according to him who holds that the command, (v. 1) \u201cand three cubits shall be the height thereof\u201d is to be taken literally (cf. Rashi on v. 1) the length of the ascent was only ten cubits, for since the altar was lower the slope leading to its top could not be a very long one. So did I find in the Boraitha \u05d3\u05de\"\u05d8 \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea (cf. Yalkut Shimoni 1:419). And as regards this statement that it stood away from the top of the altar just a hair\u2019s breadth, in Treatise Zevachim (62b) they (the Rabbis) derived it from a Biblical text."}, "5": {}, "6": {"0": " \u05d1\u05d8\u05d1\u05e2\u05ea [AND THE BARS SHALL BE BROUGHT] INTO THE RINGS \u2014 into the four rings made for the grate (v. 4)."}, "7": {"0": " \u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d1 \u05dc\u05d7\u05ea HOLLOW WITH TABLETS \u2014 Render it as the Targum does, \u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05df, hollow as regards boards (\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05df is what is termed an accusative of respect): boards of shittim-wood on all sides (cf. v. 1) and a hollow space in the middle; it shall not be in its entirety a single block of wood, the thickness of which in two directions should be five cubits by five cubits \u2014 like the trunk of a tree, which has been hollowed out."}, "8": {"0": " \u05e7\u05dc\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd HANGINGS \u2014 made like the sails of ships, full of holes, of plaited work and not weaver\u2019s work.

See Rashi on v. 7). It gives another indication by the use of the word \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4 : that, he should not fix them on that side of the breast-plate which faced outside, but on that side which faced inward, because it is said \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4, inward. It was that side which was turned toward the ephod, for the ends of the lower edge of that side of the breast-plate really lay upon the ephod since the priest tied the belt of the ephod around him and the apron was folded over in front of the priest upon his loins and upon a part of his stomach on both sides as far as against the ends of the breast-plate (i. e. the corners of the lower edge), the ends of which lay upon it."}, "26": {"0": " \u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05db\u05ea\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d4.

These were thus opposite (i. e. on a level with) the end (the lower edge) of the breastplate (but, of course, on the priest\u2019s back, whilst the breast-plate lay in front of him).

Consequently I say that it is called \u05d0\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3 in reference to the apron-like garment which hung down and that it was so called because they bedecked him (\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05d3\u05d5) and ornamented him with it, as it is said, (Leviticus 8:7) \u201cAnd he bedecked (\u05d5\u05d9\u05d0\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3) him with it.\u201d The \u05d7\u05e9\u05d1 was the girdle which was on the upper portion of it (the ephod), and the shoulder-pieces were attached to it.

Then again, it is written here, \u201cand it (the Plate) shall be upon the mitre\u201d, whilst further on (v. 38) it says, \u201cAnd it shall be upon Aaron\u2019s forehead\u201d! And in the Treatise on the Slaughter of the Sacrifices (Zevachim 19a) we learn: \u201cHis (the High Priest\u2019s) hair was visible between the Plate and the mitre, whereon he placed the Tephillin\u201d, thus informing us that the mitre was above on the crown of the head and was not so deep that the entire head went into it right down to the forehead, and that the Plate was beneath it with a space between them.

Thus, at each hole, there was one string on top of the Plate \u2014 outside it, and one inside (between the Plate and the forehead). He tied the ends of the strings, the three of them, behind the neck; it follows therefore that the length of the Plate and the strings that were at its ends together encompassed his skull. The middle string which was on its top edge bound together with the ends of the two which were at the extremities of the Plate, passed over the breadth of the head above (over the crown). Consequently it (the Plate, together with the strings) formed a kind of helmet. It is with reference to the middle string that it states, \u201cAnd it (the string just mentioned in the verse; not the Plate as was assumed) shall be upon the mitre\u201d, for he placed the Plate, with the strings already tied in this manner, upon his head as a kind of helmet passing it over the mitre, and the middle string held it (the Plate) firm so that it could not fall, and thus the Plate hung in front of his forehead and did not fall lower down.

But according to the opinion (if we adopt the opinion) of him (Rabbi Judah) who says that only whilst it was on his forehead did it atone and effect pardon, and that if it was not on his forehead it did not effect pardon, the following inference must be derived from the phrase \u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05e6\u05d7\u05d5 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3: it informs us that he must constantly touch it whilst it is on his forehead, so that he should not divert his attention from it (Yoma 7b; Shabbat 12a)."}, "38": {"0": " \u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05e6\u05ea means make them with many checkered figures, and entirely of fine linen."}, "39": {"0": " \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05ea\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05db\u05ea\u05e0\u05ea AND FOR AARON\u2019S SONS THOU SHALT MAKE INNER GARMENTS \u2014 these four garments and no more; viz., the three mentioned in this verse, \u2014 the inner garment, the girdle and the \u05de\u05d2\u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea which are identical with what is elsewhere called the mitre, \u2014 and the breeches prescribed later in this section (v. 42)."}, "4": {"0": " \u05d5\u05d4\u05dd \u05d9\u05e7\u05d7\u05d5 AND THEY SHALL TAKE \u2014 Those men, wise in heart (cf. v. 3), who are to make the garments shall receive from the donors \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05db\u05dc\u05ea THE GOLD AND THE BLUE PURPLE, in order to make the garments of them."}, "40": {"0": " \u05d5\u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05e9\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df AND THOU SHALT PUT THEM ON AARON \u2014 i. e. those which are mentioned in connection with Aaron: the breast-plate, the ephod, the Robe, the inner garment of checker-work, the mitre, the girdle and the Plate, and the breeches which are prescribed later for all of them (for all the priest\u2019s and therefore for Aaron also).", "1": " \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 [AND THOU SHALT PUT THEM ON AARON \u2026] AND ON HIS SONS WITH HIM \u2014 i. e. put on them those garments which are prescribed for them.", "2": " \u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea\u05dd AND THOU SHALT ANOINT THEM \u2014 viz., Aaron and his sons, with the oil of anointing.", "3": " \u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05dd AND THOU SHALT CONSECRATE THEM (more lit., fill their hand) \u2014 wherever the term \u201cfilling the hand\u201d is used it denotes the installation ceremony performed when one enters for the first time into an office, as a sign that he is entitled to it from that day and henceforth.

The ephod was made like that kind of apron of women who ride on horse-back. He (the priest) tied it on behind him opposite (at the height of) his heart below his elbows. Its breadth was equal to the measure of a man\u2019s back and somewhat more (cf. Rashi, end of v. 26), and it reached to his heels. The belt was attached to its top edge along the whole of its width, being of weaver\u2019s work (i. e. woven in one piece with the ephod) and it extended on both sides beyond the width of the ephod in order that it might go right round the body and gird on the ephod by means of it. The shoulder-pieces were attached to the belt, one on the right and one the left, behind the priest, at the two ends of the width of the apron, and when they were lifted up they stood (we should say \u201cthey lay\u201d) upon his two shoulders, so that they were like two straps made of the same material as the ephod itself, and sufficiently long to lift them up to reach to his neck on both sides, and they hung over in front of him a little below his shoulders. The onyx stones were fixed in them, one on his right shoulder and one on his left shoulder, and the settings were placed in their ends in front of his shoulders on his breast. Two cords of gold were inserted through two rings which were on the breastplate at the two ends of its upper width (edge), one on the right and one on the left, and the two ends of the chain (or cord) were fixed in the setting on the right, and similarly the two ends of the left chain were fixed in the setting which was on the left shoulder. Consequently, the breast-plate hung in front of him over his heart from the settings of the ephod. Further, there were two rings at the two ends of the breast-plate on its lower edge, and opposite them two rings below on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod on the lower edge of each where this was joined to the belt. The under two rings on the breast-plate were opposite the rings on the ephod, lying one upon the other, and they fastened them (each pair of rings) together by a blue purple thread which was inserted through the rings in the ephod and breast-plate, so that the lower edge of the breast-plate should lie close to the belt of the ephod and should not move about and come apart from it, swinging to and fro.", "1": " \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05ea\u05db\u05dc\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05de\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e9\u05e9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d6\u05e8 OF GOLD, OF BLUE PURPLE, AND OF RED PURPLE, OF CRIMSON AND FINE TWISTED LINEN \u2014 The five materials were intertwined in every strand: they beat out the gold into the form of thin plates and from them they cut threads, and they wove that gold thread together with six threads of blue purple and a gold thread with six threads of red purple, and similarly with the crimson and similarly with the fine linen; because all the materials had their threads sixfold and there was a gold thread with each of them. Then they intertwined them all into one thread; it followed, therefore, that their thread was 28-fold. This is how it is explained in Treatise Yoma (72a) and it is derived from the following verse: (Exodus 39:3) \u201cAnd they beat out the gold into thin plates and cut it into threads to work the threads of gold in the blue purple and in the red purple, etc.\u201d \u2014 this tells us that a gold thread was intertwined with each material.", "2": " \u05de\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e9\u05d1 THE WORK OF AN ARTIST \u2014 I have already explained (Exodus 26:1) that this was weaving on both sides: that is, that the designs on both sides were not similar one to the other."}, "6": {"0": " \u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05db\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05f3 TWO SHOULDER-PIECES, etc. \u2014 The apron was below and the \u05d7\u05e9\u05d1 of the ephod was the belt, and this was joined to it on its top edge similar to the apron of ladies who ride on horseback. On the priest\u2019s back there were joined to the belt two pieces like two wide straps, one opposite each shoulder. He lifted these up upon his two shoulders so that they hung down in front of him before his breast, and because they were joined to the rings in the breast-plate they were held fast in front of him upon his heart so that they could not fall off his shoulders backwards, just as is explained in this section (v. 28).

Now since it is said, \u201cAnything that toucheth the altar shall become holy\u201d, I might infer that this applies to a thing whether it was fitting to be an offering at the time when it was brought into the Sanctuary or whether it was not so fitting as, for example, in the latter case, something the disqualification of which did not happen within the Sanctuary itself but had happened before it was brought there, such as, an animal, male or female, with which sexual sin had been committed, or an animal which had been set aside as a sacrifice to an idol, or one which had been worshipped as a god, or one which showed signs of incapacity to live owing to certain diseases (technically termed \u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05d4) and animals similar to these (with similar disqualifications); consequently it states, \u201cNow this is that which thou shalt offer [upon the altar]\u201d, which follows immediately after this (in v. 38). Now how is it in the case of the burnt-offering which is mentioned in the next verse as something commanded to be brought upon the altar? It must be fitted to be brought upon the altar! So, also, the preceding statement, \u201cWhatever [touches the altar shall become holy]\u201d, refers only to whatever was fitting, i. e. what was already fitting to be brought upon the altar and became disqualified only after it had been brought into the fore-court of the Sanctuary, as, for example, that which had been left over night (the blood or fat of a sacrifice which had been left until the morning without having been placed upon the altar), or that which, before it had been placed upon the altar, had been taken (lit., had gone forth) outside the forecourt, or that which had become unclean, or an animal which had been slaughtered with the intention to sprinkle the blood or to burn the fat or to eat the flesh outside the prescribed period or outside the prescribed place, and animals similar to these (Zevachim 83b; Sifra on Leviticus 6:2)."}, "37": {}, "38": {}, "39": {"0": " \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05df \u05e1\u05dc\u05ea A TENTH DEAL OF FLOUR \u2014 i. e. a tenth part of an ephah: a capacity of forty three and a fifth eggs (cf.

One mention is an allusion to the heave offering that was to be used for the making of the sockets, for he (Moses) counted them when they began to contribute towards the building of the Tabernacle, when each gave half a shekel, the total amounting to a hundred talents, as it is said, (Exodus 38:25) \u201cand the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents\u201d, and of these the sockets were made, as it is stated, (Exodus 38:27) \u201cAnd of the hundred talents of silver [were cast the sockets of the Sanctuary etc.]\u201d. The second heave offering was also levied by way of census, for he numbered them again after the Tabernacle was erected; that is the census referred to in the beginning of the Book of Numbers: (Numbers 1:1) \u201c[And the Lord spake unto Moses] \u2026 on the first day of the second month in the second year \u2026 [Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel]\u201d, and on that occasion, too, each of them gave half a shekel. These were employed in purchasing the communal sacrifices for each year. Rich and poor were made alike in regard to these half shekels; and it is with reference to this heave offering that Scripture uses here the expression \u05dc\u05db\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, \u201cto make expiation for your souls\u201d, for sacrifices were brought in order to make atonement. The third heave offering was that offered for the building of the Tabernacle, as it is said, (Exodus 35:24) \u201cEvery one that did offer an offering of silver and brass\u2026\u201d. In this heave offering, however, they did not all participate alike, but each one brought whatever his heart prompted him to give (jeru. Shekalim 1:1; cf. Rashi on Exodus 25:1)."}, "15": {"0": " \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 AND THOU SHALT GIVE IT FOR THE SERVICE OF THE APPOINTED TENT \u2014 From this statement you may learn that he (Moses) was commanded to take their census when they began to contribute towards the building of the Tabernacle, after the incident of the golden calf, because the pestilence had befallen them, as it is said, (Exodus 32:35) \u201cand the Lord plagued the people\u201d. A parable: To what may this be compared? To a flock that is dear to its owner upon which there fell pestilence. As soon as it ceased he said to the shepherd, \u201cI beg of you, count my sheep and ascertain how many of them are left\u201d. He did this to show that it (the flock) was dear to him. \u2014 It is, however, impossible to say that the census mentioned here is identical with that spoken of in the Book of Numbers (1:1), for there (in Numbers 1:1) Scripture states, \u201c[And God spake to Moses \u2026] on the first day of the second month \u2026 [Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel etc.]\u201d, whilst the Tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month as it is said, (Exodus 40:2) \u201cOn the first day of the first month shalt thou set up [the Tabernacle etc.]\u201d, and from this census (that mentioned in this paragraph) \u2014 from the shekels obtained by it \u2014 the sockets used for its boards were made, for it is said, (Exodus 38:27) and of the hundred talents of silver were cast [the sockets of the sanctuary]\u201d. Consequently you learn from this that two censuses were taken, viz., one at the beginning of their contributing towards the Tabernacle, after the Day of Atonement (when Moses first commanded the people to engage in the construction of the Tabernacle; see Rashi on Exodus 33:11, last sentence), in the first year, and the other in the second year, in Iyar, after the Tabernacle had already been set up. If you ask, however: is it at all possible that on both of these occasions the number of the Israelites was exactly the same, viz., 603,550, for in the account of how the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation was used (Exodus 38:27) it is so stated, and in the Book of Numbers (1:46) exactly the same is stated, \u201cEven all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty\u201d; were not these censuses taken in two different years, and surely it is impossible that there were not at the time of the first census people nineteen years old who accordingly were not counted and who became twenty years old in the second year when the second census was taken and this must have added to the total?! The reply to this question is: As far as the years of men\u2019s ages are concerned they were counted in the same year, but reckoning from the time of the exodus from Egypt they were two different years in which the censuses were held. For when we speak of a period beginning with the exodus from Egypt, which took place in Nisan, we calculate from Nisan, as we have learned in Treatise Rosh Hashanah (2b). Consequently the Tabernacle was being built in the first year and was erected in the second year, because a new year began on the first of Nisan following the exodus. The years of people\u2019s ages, however, were counted according to the era of the creation of the world which begins with Tishri, consequently from this point of view both censuses took place in the same year: the first in Tishri after the Day of Atonement when the Omnipresent became reconciled with Israel to grant them His pardon and when they received the command regarding the construction of the Tabernacle, and the second on the first of Iyar, so that those who were only 19 years old after the Day of Atonement when the first census was taken, were not yet regarded as twenty in Iyar when the second census was held even though they were born between Tishri and Iyar.", "1": " \u05e2\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d4\u05dc \u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 FOR THE SERVICE OF THE APPOINTED TENT \u2014 i. e. for the sockets that were made of it (the expiation money)."}, "16": {}, "17": {"0": " \u05db\u05d9\u05d5\u05e8 A LAVER \u2014 like a large pot with teats which discharged water by the way of their openings.", "1": " \u05d5\u05db\u05e0\u05d5 \u2014 Understand this as the Targum renders it: \u05d1\u05e1\u05d9\u05e1\u05d4 ITS BASE, i. e. a stand specially made for the laver.", "2": " \u05dc\u05e8\u05d7\u05e6\u05d4 TO LAVE WITHAL \u2014 This, of course, refers to the laver and not to the base.", "3": " \u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05d1\u05d7 BETWEEN [THE APPOINTED TENT AND] THE ALTAR \u2014 the altar of burnt offering of which it is written, (Exodus 40:6) that is was to be set \u201cbefore the entrance of the dwelling of the appointed tent\u201d.

But whatever is not proper to them (to these vessels) they do not make holy (Zevachim 87a). A similar statement is made in an uncontroverted (Hebrew: perfect) Boraitha (Zevachim 83b) about the hallowing power of the altar: Since it is said, (Exodus 29:37) \u201cWhatsoever toucheth the altar shall become holy\u201d, I might infer that this applies to a thing whether it was fitting to be an offering at the time when it was brought into the Sanctuary or whether it was not fitting; Scripture therefore states immediately afterwards, (Exodus 29:38) \u201c[Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar]; two lambs\u201d. Now how is it in the case of the lambs? They are fitting for the altar! So, also, does the preceding statement, \u201cWhatsoever [touches the altar shall become holy]\u201d, refer only to anything that is fitting (i. e. that was already fitting to be brought upon the altar and became disqualified only after it had been brought into the forecourt of the Sanctuary). \u2014 In all cases where the term \u05de\u05e9\u05d7, \u201cto anoint\u201d, is used with reference to the Tabernacle or priests or kings it is rendered by the Targum by the appropriate form of the verb \u05e8\u05d1\u05d4, \u201cto raise to high rank\u201d, \u201cto distinguish\u201d, because the anointing of them had no other purpose than to show the distinction that was being bestowed upon them. For thus did the Heavenly King ordain (Rashi uses here the words of the text, (Esther 1:9) that this should constitute their installation in their high office. In any other case, however, where \u05de\u05e9\u05d7 is used, \u2014 for instance, (Exodus 29:2) \u201cwafers [unleavened] \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd with oil\u201d; (Amos 6:6) \u201cand with the chief ointments \u05d9\u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05d5\u201d \u2014 the Aramaic expression for them in the Targum is the same term as the Hebrew text, viz., a form of \u05de\u05e9\u05d7; (because in these passages anointing is an end in itself, whilst in the former case it is an indication only of elevation to a distinguished position)."}, "29": {}, "3": {"0": " \u05e6\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 Here this word must signify \u201ccorners\u201d (not \u201csides\u201d as Rashi explains in Exodus 25:12), as it is translated in the Targum, since it is stated afterwards, \u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5, \u201cupon the two sides of it\u201d, so that the phrases mean, \u201cthe two corners that are on its two sides\u201d.", "1": " \u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 (lit., \u201cand it shall be\u201d, not \u201cthey shall be\u201d) \u2014 i. e. the making of these rings (this ring-work) shall be (shall serve) \u2014", "2": "\u05dc\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd FOR PLACES FOR THE STAVES \u2014 i.e. the ring shall serve as a place for the stave (cf.

But these \u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e8\u05d3 are identical with the garments of blue purple wool, and red purple wool, and crimson wool which are mentioned in the chapter (Numbers IV.) giving an account of Israel\u2019s encampments: (Numbers 4:12) \u201cand they shall put them in a garment of blue purple\u201d; (Numbers 4:13) \u201cand spread a garment of red purple thereon\u201d; (Numbers 4:8) \u201cand they shall spread upon them a garment of crimson\u201d.

There is, however, no other example of it (of \u05e9\u05e8\u05d3) in Scriptures.

Similar are: (Judges 5:28) \u201c[Why is] his chariot so long (\u05d1\u05e9\u05e9) [in coming]?\u201d; (Judges 3:25) \u201cAnd they waited until it was late (\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d5\u05e9)\u201d. For when Moses ascended the mountain he said to them (to the Israelites): at the end of a period of forty days (i. e. on the fortieth day) I shall return during the first six hours of the day (before noon). They thought that the day on which he ascended the mountain (the seventh of Sivan) was to be included in this number (thus \u2014 Sivan having 30 days \u2014 he was expected back before noon on the sixteenth of Tammuz). In fact, however, he had said to them \u201cafter forty days\u201d meaning complete days \u2014 forty days, each day together with its night that precedes it \u2014 (as is the customary Jewish reckoning; cf. Genesis 1:5: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8). Now, as regards the day of this ascent, its night was not part of it that it can be reckoned as a complete day, for he ascended on the seventh of Sivan early in the morning (cf. Rashi on Exodus 19:3); it follows therefore that the fortieth day really fell on the seventeenth of Tammuz and not as the people had believed on the sixteenth. On the sixteenth of Tammuz Satan came and threw the world into confusion, giving it the appearance of darkness, gloom and disorder that people should say: \u201cSurely Moses is dead, and that is why confusion has come into the world!\u201d He said to them, \u201cYes, Moses is dead, for six hours (noon) has already come (\u05d1\u05e9\u05e9 = \u200e\u05d1\u05d0 \u05e9\u05e9) and he has not returned etc.\u201d \u2014 as is related in Treatise Sabbath (89a; cf.

One cannot, however, say that they erred only on account of it being a cloudy day, their mistake consisting in not being able to distinguish between forenoon and afternoon, and that thus they were correct in their supposition that he was to return on the sixteenth of Tammuz; for this assumes that he really returned on the day when they made the calf, but that they were under the impression that noon was past \u2014 for, as a matter of fact, Moses did not come down until the following day (the day after they had made the calf), for it is said (v. 6) \u201cAnd they rose up early in the morrow, and brought up burnt offerings\u201d\u2014 and only after wards the Lord said to Moses (v. 7) \u201cGo, go down; for thy people \u2026 have corrupted themselves\u201d.", "1": " \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 [MAKE US GODS] WHICH SHALL GO BEFORE US \u2014 They wished to have many gods (the words \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd is to be taken as plural since the verb \u05d9\u05dc\u05db\u05d5 is plural; cf.

There are some of our Rabbis who say that this refers to ploughing in the year preceding the Sabbatical year which ploughing passeth into (produces its first fruits in) the seventh year and to harvesting grain that has reached one-third of its maturity during the Sabbatical year which harvesting actually goeth forth into (takes place in) the eighth year, that following the Sabbatical year; and that this statement is intended to teach you that one must add part of the secular time to the holy time (i. e. that one must apply to a certain period before the beginning and after the termination of the Sabbatical year the laws applicable to that year in order to prevent its desecration). Thus, the following is what it (this verse) means: \u201cSix days thou mayest work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest\u201d; but even with regard to the six days\u2019 work which I have permitted you there are years when ploughing and harvesting are forbidden. This must be the meaning, referring to ploughing in the sixth year and harvesting in the seventh, and it cannot refer to the seventh year itself for it is unnecessary to make any mention of ploughing and harvesting in the seventh year being forbidden, for it is already said (Leviticus 25:4) \u201c[But in the seventh year \u2026] thou shalt neither sow thy field [nor prune thine vineyard]\u201d! Others, however, hold that Scripture in this part of the text, is only speaking of the ordinary Sabbath day, as in the first part, and ploughing and harvesting which are specially mentioned in it as being forbidden on the Sabbath are mentioned to suggest to you the following: What is the characteristic of ploughing? It is an optional act (no such work being commanded anywhere in the Law)! So, too, is harvesting forbidden on Sabbath only when it constitutes an optional act! There is, therefore, excluded the harvesting of the barley for the \u201cOmer\u201d (cf.

Even these did they not hesitate to bring as a contribution towards the Tabernacle. Now Moses was about to reject them since they were made to pander to their vanity, but the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \u201cAccept them; these are dearer to Me than all the other contributions, because through them the women reared those huge hosts in Egypt!\u201d For when their husbands were tired through the crushing labour they used to bring them food and drink and induced them to eat. Then they would take the mirrors, and each gazed at herself in her mirror together with her husband, saying endearingly to him, \u201cSee, I am handsomer than you!\u201d Thus they awakened their husbands\u2019 affection and subsequently became the mothers of many children, at it is said, (Song 8:5) \u201cI awakened thy love under the apple-tree\u201d, (referring to the fields where the men worked).

And it was for this reason that the laver was made of them (the mirrors) \u2014 because it served the purpose of promoting peace between man and wife viz., by giving of its waters to be drunk by a woman whose husband had shown himself jealous of her and who nevertheless had associated with another (cf. Numbers ch. V) thus affording her an opportunity to prove her innocence (cf. Sotah 15b). You may know that the \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea mentioned in the text were really mirrors (and that the word does not mean visions, or appearance, etc.), for it is said, (v. 29) \u201cAnd the copper of the wave-offering was seventy talents etc. \u2026 and therewith he made [the sockets etc.]\u201d \u2014 the laver, however, and its base are not mentioned there amongst the articles made from that copper; hence you may learn that the copper of which the laver was made was not a part of the copper of the weave-offering, which is the only copper mentioned as having been contributed by the people. Thus did R. Tanchuma explain the term \u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05ea.

Now the plate rested on his forehead (cf. Exodus 28:38), consequently the mitre was above (on the crown of the head) and the plate beneath (on the forehead). What then can be the meaning of \u201cto fasten it on high upon the mitre\u201d? Besides, I have put another question about this: here it says, \u201cand they put upon it (the plate) a thread of blue purple\u201d and in the section where the command is given it states, (Exodus 28:37) \u201cAnd thou shalt put it on a blue purple string\u201d (so that the plate was above the thread, not beneath it as is here commanded). I therefore say that this \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05dc of blue purple mentioned here was not an ornament but threads by which to tie it (the plate) on the mitre. For the plate reached only from one ear to the other, so with what could they tie it to his forehead? So blue purple threads were attached to it at its (the plate\u2019s) two ends and on the middle by means of which they tied it on and hung it on the mitre whenever this was on his head. There were two threads on each end (of the plate) one on its upper side and the other underneath, on the side next to the forehead and so also at the middle of it (the plate) \u2014 because in this way it was easy to tie it on. Since, however, the way of tying a thing on is by not less than two threads the text is justified in saying both, (Exodus 23:37) \u201c[And thou shalt put it] on a blue purple thread\u201d and here \u201cand they put upon it a thread of blue purple\u201d. He (the High Priest) tied both ends of all of them (of all the threads) together behind him on his neck, and thus placed it (the plate) on the mitre. Do not be puzzled because it does not say \u201cthreads of blue purple\u201d seeing that there were many (three double threads altogether), for we find the same thing in the case of the breast-plate and the ephod: (Exodus 28:28) \u201cAnd they shall fasten the breast-plate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod \u2026 with a string (and not with strings) of blue purple\u201d and you must admit that there could not have been less than two strings, for at the two ends of the breast-plate were the two rings of the breast-plate and on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod were the two rings of the ephod opposite to them. Now according to the way the breast-plate was tied on there were four threads, and under any circumstances with less than two it would have been impossible to tie it on, and yet Scripture speaks of \u201ca string\u201d of blue purple."}, "31": {"0": " \u05d5\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MADE the work \u05db\u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4' \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05f3 ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES [SO DID THEY] or [SO THEY MADE IT]."}, "32": {"0": " \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05df \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5\u05f3 AND THEY BROUGHT THE TABERNACLE [UNTO MOSES etc.], for they themselves were unable to erect it.

And our teachers taught with regard to the above, that when Moses said \"Why have you harmed\" the Holy One said \"Alas for those who have been lost and cannot be found.

So, too, in the case of Isaac, people strove with him for possession of the wells which he had dug. Similarly, of Jacob it is stated, (Genesis 33:19) \u201cHe purchased a parcel of field,\u201d in which to pitch his tent. Yet none of them criticised My dealings with them, whilst you say \u201cWherefore hast Thou done so evil [to this people!]\u201d \u2014 But this Midrashic exposition does not fit in with the text for several reasons. Firstly, because Scripture does not state \u201cAnd they did not ask of Me regarding my Name, the Lord\u201d. And if you say in refutation of my objection that they did not mean that \u05d5\u05e9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4' \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9 actually signifies that they did not ask what is My Name, but it means \u201cHe did not tell them that this was His Name and yet they did not ask Him what it was\u201d, then I reply that these words cannot mean that He did not tell them His name, for at the very first when He revealed Himself to Abraham at the Covenant \u201cbetween the pieces\u2019\u2019 it is said, (Genesis 15:7) \u201cI am the Lord (\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05f3) who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees\u201d. Further (secondly), how does the context run on to the statements which Scripture places after the above verses, viz., \u201cAnd I have also heard etc.\u201d and \u201cWherefore say unto the children of Israel etc.\u201d? Therefore I say: let Scripture be explained in its literal sense so that each statement fits into its proper setting, but the Midrashic exposition may also be given, if you like, as it is said (Jeremiah 23:29) \u201cIs not my word like as fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer which, by the force of its own blow, the rock at which it strikes shatters in pieces\u201d."}, "80": {}, "81": {}, "82": {}, "83": {}, "84": {}, "85": {}, "86": {}, "87": {}, "88": {}, "89": {}, "9": {}, "90": {}, "91": {}, "92": {}, "93": {}, "94": {}, "95": {}, "96": {}, "97": {}, "98": {}, "99": {}}, "6": {"0": {"0": " \u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05d9\u05da \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 This signifies I have made thee a judge and castigator \u2014 to castigate him with plagues and pains.", "1": " \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05da [AARON] SHALL BE THY PROPHET \u2014 This must be understood as the Targum takes it: thy interpreter.
