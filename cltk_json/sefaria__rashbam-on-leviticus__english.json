The zav\u2019s ritual impurity is still conferred upon him. The common denominator of the wide-ranging ability to confer impurity of zav, zavah, and niddah, the menstruating woman, are that they confer their own severe degree of ritual impurity to anything which lies underneath them even though not in physical contact with them. The only exception to this rule is if said afflicted party sits or lies on something that does not normally serve as a place to sit on or to lie on.

This is the way the sages interpret the words above (compare Rashi) Personally, I believe that the plain meaning of these words above is that the person experiencing these drippings and sticky semen adhering to his flesh mentioned in verse 3 has not yet removed this from himself. The Torah uses an elegant way saying \u201che has not washed it off with water,\u201d basically, it refers to a removal by wiping or scraping his skin including his glans. The lesson here is that a simple immersion in a ritual bath, if not after the removal of the offending material, does not accomplish its purpose of ritually cleansing the afflicted party. This has been explained in detail in Niddah 15 where the words in our verse are understood as \u201calthough he had previously immersed himself he still remains ritually impure, seeing he had not first cleansed himself physically. Spiritual cleanliness presupposes physical cleanliness.\u201d Anything or anyone touching the offending fluid (until it has thoroughly dried, congealed) becomes contaminated ritually.<br> The expression \u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, loosely translated as \u201cimmersing one\u2019s hands in water,\u201d is used here in a sense similar to Proverbs 30,20 where the author describes the unfaithful wife as \u201cwiping her mouth\u201d after indulging in illicit sex, proclaiming that now that she has \u201cwiped the offending residue of her indulgence,\u201d she has not committed any sin. Solomon describes the scenario sarcastically, of course. A similar scenario occurs in Judges 3,24, where Eglon\u2019s servants assumed that their king was still busy using his private toilet and this was why he did not open the door for them. The expression used there was \u05de\u05e1\u05d9\u05da \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e8\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5, an elegant way of referring to someone urinating or excreting.<br> Here the Torah uses the elegant way of referring to the sticky mess still adhering to the afflicted party\u2019s body as \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d8\u05e3 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, \u201che did not rinse his hands in water.\u201d In other words, he had not yet gotten rid of the offensive material causing the ritual impurity in the first place. The expression is used without recourse to elegance in Leviticus 6,21 where the words \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7 \u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05e3 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05dd mean: \u201dit has to be purged and thoroughly rinsed out in water.\u201d The fatty substances of the sin offering in that vessel have to be cleaned out. In Isaiah 28,2 we also read about \u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd, \u201cthe destructive force of mighty waters.\u201d It sweeps away anything before its force, \u201ccleans\u201d it out.

He is then, however, not of a sufficiently severe degree of ritual impurity to contaminate clothing (even his own) over and beyond his body.

This degree of ritual contamination is sufficient to confer further contamination on food and drink coming into contact with it. The severity of contamination of someone lying on top of a menstruating woman is equivalent to that of someone below a male afflicted with the disease of being zav.
