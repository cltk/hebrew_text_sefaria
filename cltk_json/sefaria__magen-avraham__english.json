Therefore, most women have the practice of not praying regularly, because immediately after washing their hands in the morning they say some request, and this is biblically sufficient, and it is possible that the sages did not extend their obligation any further.  But the Ramban thinks that tefillah is rabbinic, and this is the opinion of most decisors."}, "1": {"0": "......", "1": "Bless \"Hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz\" [Who takes out bread from the ground] - (And if many people are eating together, the people dining should direct their heart (intention) to the person saying the beracha, and answer amen, and the person saying the beracha should give intention to the amen - Or Zarua).

Additionally, there are 10 words in the blessing of \"Hamotzi\" and 10 words in the following verses: Psalms 104:14, \"He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and grass for the service of man: that he may bring forth bread out of the land.\" Psalms 145:15, \"The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food at the proper time.\" Deuteronomy 8:8, \"A land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey.\" Bresheit 27:28, \"May G!d give you from the dew of heaven and fat of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine.\"", "4": "The Beis Yosef writes in the name of Tosafos [who] quotes the Medrash, that when the Jewish people are sitting and waiting (after washing) for each other before making Hamotzie, and they are without any mitzvos, The Satan stands to prosecute them. The covenant of salt protects them. Also see Siman 166 [where it states] that it is better to talk words of Torah that to sit idle. and better than both is to avoid an interruption altogether.

And already most of those who learn do this.  It's possible to give a reason for this according to its simple understanding, that Israel slept all the night, and the Holy One Blessed be He had to wake them, as the midrash says.

See also Yevamot 82 in Tosafot and the Raavad disagree in various places. In the Mishnah (Mishnah maaser Sheni 1:5) it says that if there is no mikdash it [maaser] should be left to rot. If this is so, there is no holiness even for he that enters there, and there is no [penalty of] karet. [...] The words of the Rambam are correct that one who enters the place of the mikdash is liable for karet because we are all tamei met. "}}}
