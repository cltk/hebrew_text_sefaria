Rashi is coming to explain why each one wants such a set-up] The homeowner sometimes doesn't have money available in the morning (to pay the worker...and therefore would rather wait until night time to pay him) and the worker (doesn't want to be paid in the morning) in order that he shouldn't spend (and waist the money during the day...and would rather save it) until the nighttime so he could use it for his livelihood (important things) "}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "9": {}}, "originalTitle": "\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Rashi on Shevuot", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
