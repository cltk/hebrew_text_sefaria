He said, \u201cReuben, my son, I will tell you why I have not reproved you for your unfitial conduct during all these years: it was in order that you should not leave me and go and join Esau, my wicked brother\". \u2014 And on account of four things one should not reprove a person except shortly before one's death: that one should not reprove him and again have to reprove him; and that his fellow whom he reproves should not. when he afterwards happens to see him, feel ashamed before him, etc.; as it is set forth in Siphre. And similarly, Joshua reproved Israel only shortly before his death (cf. Joshua 24:1\u201429), and so, too, Samuel, as it is said, (I Samuel 12:3) \u201cBehold, testify against me\", and so, also, David reproved his son Solomon only shortly before his death (cf. 1 Kings 2:1\u20149).", "3": {"0": "\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5 AFTER HE HAD SMITTEN [SIHON] \u2014 Moses said: If I reprove them before they enter at least a part of the land, they will say, \u201cWhat claim has this man upon us?

And it was necessary to state this because so far it has been mentioned only with regard to that one Passover sacrifice that was offered in Egypt (\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd) (Exodus 22:10). \u2014 The \u201cfirst day\u201d spoken of here is the fourteenth day of Nisan (not the, fifteenth which is the first day of the Festival), just as you must explain that term in the passage (Exodus 22:15): \u201ceven the first day (\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df) ye shall put away leaven out of your houses\u201d (cf.

For if it had written only \u201cneither shall any of the flesh which thou sacrificedst at even (not mentioning \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df) remain all night until the morning\u201d, I might have thought that the peace offerings which are slaughtered during all the seven days all come under the prohibition of \u201cand thou shalt not leave any of it until the morning\u201d (Exodus 22:12), and may therefore be eaten one day and the following night only (which is not so); therefore it wrote \u201c[neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst] at even on the first day [remain all night]\u201d. \u2014 Another explanation is that Scripture speaks here of the festival offering brought on the fourteenth of Nisan (\u05d7\u05d2\u05d9\u05d2\u05ea \u05d9\u05f4\u05d3, not of the \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05df \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7) and that it teaches with reference to it that it may be eaten during two successive days and the intervening night (cf. however, Rashi on Exodus 7:14 and Note 2 thereon). As regards the first day\u201d that is mentioned here \u2014 according to this explanation \u2014 Scripture is speaking of the first day of the festival (the fifteenth of Nisan), and what the verse implies is the following: None of the flesh of the festival offering which you slaughtered at even (i.e. towards eventide on the fourteenth of Nisan) shall remain on the first day of the festival until the morning of the second day of the festival (the sixteenth of Nisan), but it may be eaten on the fourteenth and the fifteenth (and the intervening night).

Another explanation is: It teaches regarding the eating of unleavened bread on the seventh day of Passover that it is not obligatory; and from here (from this law concerning the seventh day) you may derive the law for the other six days.

Now, according to the well-known rule, it did not leave the general statement in order to teach this regarding itself alone but regarding everything that is included in the general statement. Now how is it with the seventh day? It is optional as regards the eating of unleavened bread (as explained in the earlier portion of this comment)! This, too, according to the rule, applies also to everything that was included in the general statement, and therefore all the other days are also optional in this respect, with the exception, however, of the first night of Passover, for which Scripture has fixed it (the eating of unleavened bread) as an obligation, as it is said, (Exodus 22:18) \u201cat evening ye shall eat unleavened bread\u201d (Mekhilta on Exodus 12:18; Pesachim 120a; cf. also Rashi on Exodus 12:15).", "1": "\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05da [AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY SHALL BE] A RESTRICTION IN HONOR OF THE LORD \u2014 i.e., restrict yourself from work. \u2014 Another explanation is that \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea denotes a gathering for eating and drinking (a banquet), like the expression used (Judges 13:15) \u201cLet us detain (\u05e0\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05d4) thee [that we may make ready a kid for thee]\u201d."}, "7": "\u05de\u05d4\u05d7\u05dc \u05d7\u05e8\u05de\u05e9 \u05d1\u05e7\u05de\u05d4 [BEGIN TO NUMBER SEVEN WEEKS] FROM THE TIME THOU BEGINNEST TO PUT THE SICKLE TO THE CORN \u2014 i.e. from when the \u201cOmer\u201d has been cut (from the sixteenth of Nisan) which is the first produce to be harvested (Leviticus 23:10) (cf.

I do not, however, know for certain what this means (what Siphre means by \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 and \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d4). But it seems to me that the part of the land of Canaan which is on the other (the western) side of the Jordan and onwards is called the land of the five nations (and these are therefore the five referred to by Siphre), whilst the territory of Sihon and Og on the eastern side might be called the land of the two nations, viz., the Amorites and the Canaanites, \u2014 and \u05e0\u05d7\u05dc\u05ea \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 mentioned in Siphre is intended to include the land of the remaining clans (\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8), the Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, which will become Israel\u2019s inheritance in some future time. (But the land of Sihon and Og need not be mentioned since this was already divided among the two and a half tribes, and it was known that the tribe of Levi had no share in it.) Similarly it (Siphre) makes a comment in \u201cthe section dealing with the gifts that were promised to Aaron\u201d on the verse (Numbers 18:24) \u201cwherefore [I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance]\u201d that it is intended to express a warning regarding the land of the Kenite, the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite (i.e. that not even in later times when Israel will inherit the land of these nations shall the Levite have a portion in it). \u2014 It has since been found in the words of Rabbi Kalonymus that the proper version of this passage in Sifrei reads as follows:<br>\u05d5\u05e0\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5 BUT THEY SHALL HAVE NO INHERITANCE \u2014 this refers to the territory of the five,<br>\u05d1\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5 AMONGST THEIR BRETHREN \u2014 this refers to the territory of the seven, and he explains that this means the five tribes and the seven tribes. And because Moses and Joshua assigned an inheritance in the land only to five tribes \u2014 for Moses assigned their inheritance to Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh, and Joshua assigned their inheritance to Judah, Ephraim and the other half tribe of Manasseh, whilst the remaining seven tribes took their portions themselves in the land (conquered it) after the death of Joshua \u2014 for this reason it (Scripture) mentions (alludes to) the five tribes separately and to the seven separately.

Another explanation: It further teaches regarding priests who appear in the Temple as pilgrims on the festivals that they may offer [with the rota], and do the services connected with the sacrifices that are offered on account of the festival, as for instance, the additional offerings due on festivals \u2014 although the shift is not theirs (Siphre; Sukkah 55b)."}, "6": "\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05db\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 THEY SHALL ENJOY LIKE PORTIONS \u2014 This teaches that they (the priests who come to Jerusalem on the festivals as pilgrims but are not in charge) participate in the hides (of the burnt offerings due on the festivals) and the flesh of the he goats brought as sin-offerings on account of the festivals.

Although this idea is not really applicable to God, Scripture makes the human ear hear the matter (i.e. it tells it to him) in the manner that it is accustomed and able to understand according to the ordinary course of the world (i.e. when speaking of God it uses language that properly is applicable only to human beings because this the only language we have at our command).", "1": "\u05d5\u05e7\u05e0\u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 \u2014 This is a term denoting wrath, emportment in old French; it means: retaining one\u2019s hold on the 'garment of vengeance', and not forgoing one\u2019s right to punish."}, "12": "\u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 \u2014 Above, however, (Deuteronomy 28:61) it says: And every sickness and every plague \u2026 [which is not written] \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea) \u05d1\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea the feminine form, whilst here we have \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4, the masculine)?!

Through the division into clauses by means of the tonic accents (which serve also as marks of interpunctuation) they (the two phrases) are shown to be two different expressions: in the chapter containing the curses (ch. Deuteronomy 28:61) the Tipcha (a disjunctive accent) is placed beneath the word \u05d1\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8, and the words \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea are connected one with the other, therefore it says \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea, the feminine form, (since it has to be connected with a feminine noun), whilst here the Tipcha is placed beneath the word \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, and consequently the words \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 are connected one with the other (i.e. they form one phrase), \u2014 therefore it is a masculine word that is applicable after it, because the term (the pronoun) refers to \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 (which is masculine).", "13": {"0": "\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5\u05dd [FOR THEY \u2026 SERVED OTHER GODS] WHOM THEY KNEW NOT \u2014 i.e. in whom they had never experienced any Divine power.", "1": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd means, He did not give them (the gods) to be their portion (cf.
