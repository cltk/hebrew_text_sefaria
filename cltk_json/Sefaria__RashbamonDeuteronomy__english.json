In Exodus 14,2, the Israelites are described as making a turnabout before a place described as Pi Hachirot, elaborating by saying that this Pi Hachirot is between Migdol and the sea to the north of Baal Yzefon. In Judges 21,19 an annual festival was observed at Shiloh which is described as situated north of Beyt El, east of the highway which runs from Beyt El to Shechem and south of Levonah.<br> If locations which did not have the distinction of serving as places where parts of the Torah were revealed to the Jewish people were described in such detail, it is not surprising that places where such parts of the Torah were revealed are described in detail.

In recognition of how you have treated him, G\u2019d will bless you in all your undertakings. The meaning of this paragraph is similar to the admonition of the Torah in verse 10 and the use of the term \u05e8\u05e2 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05da occurs also in such a sense in Deut. 28,56 when the reaction of even a mother and wife to the pressures of famine are described. \u05e8\u05d5\u05e2\u05ea \u05e2\u05d9\u05df, describes envy and jealousy in matters financial. The same is true of the expression \u05e7\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1, being hard-hearted. Both expressions refer to the feelings of a person when he has to give of his money to others who he does not feel have a claim on his money, on his generosity. Those commentators who understand our verse as speaking of the employer feeling put out at having to release their worker and the Torah telling the employer that he had no cause for the worker had worked diligently for six years are in error. The master knew in advance that after six years the contract was complete and the worker would be free to go. What possible reason could the employer have of being jealous of that arrangement?<br> Furthermore, the Torah should not have written \u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05db\u05e8 \u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05e8, but merely \u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05e8. Some commentators take the view that the words \u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05e8 refer to the six years, seeing that the average period for which a labourer was hired used to be 3 years, so that the word \u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 would refer to the fact that this labourer worked for twice that period. The idea that the standard period was three years is reflected in Isaiah 16,14 This is also senseless, seeing that in Isaiah 21,16 we are told that the average period of hire was precisely a year, no longer. It follows that the words \u05db\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05e8 (as the years of a hired hand) mean precisely 3 years just as when he is hired for a year it means precisely a year.\n"}, "18": {"0": "\u05ea\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05da, this means that you are to treat it as if sacred, i.e. not to shear its wool, not to use it to perform labour, etc. I have already explained the meaning of the words \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 in Leviticus 27,26 as meaning that it cannot be designated as an offering for the altar."}, "2": {}, "3": {"0": "\u05d0\u05e4\u05e1 \u05db\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05da \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df, if you observe the sh\u2019mittah regulations meticulously, G\u2019d will recompense you."}, "4": {"0": "\u05d0\u05dd \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e2 \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\u05e2...\u05d5\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05d8\u05ea, you will collect pawns as collaterals for the loans you extend to the gentile nations."}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {"0": " \u05db\u05d9 \u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7 \u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05da, but"}, "8": {"0": "\u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05e8 \u05dc\u05da \u05e4\u05df \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d1\u05d1\u05da \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05e2\u05dc, meaning something evil, unworthy.

Having first named these specific concerns and declared them as legitimate under the circumstances, the Torah proceeds to include all other kinds of concerns which inspire fear for his impending death in the heart of a person. (verse 8). This pattern is not as unusual as it strikes us at first glance, seeing that Solomon employs it in Kohelet 1,3-9. He begins by listing examples of things he considers futile in this life, such as 1) a generation goes, another takes its place, a constant change, nothing remaining whereas the \u201cdead\u201d earth remains forever.<br> 2) The sun rises and the suns sets; 3) the rivers all end up in the ocean but the ocean never flows over. Solomon tires of listing all the phenomena that recur constantly since the days of creation, all except man, because no new generation is exactly like the generation preceding it. The result is that the generation that has died is not remembered as it has never been replaced. This is why Solomon considers death the most futile phenomenon, seeing it wipes out what there was without replacing it. By the time Solomon reaches verse 9 he comes to the conclusion that seeing that there is nothing new in this life on earth which has not happened before, everything is remembered by reason of that very fact. However, just because one generation is not at all like a previous generation, man\u2019s existence is apt to be forgotten, precisely because there is no one around anymore to duplicate what previous generations have done.

I will explain all of them. There are only two of these which are sometimes committed in private and sometimes in public. These are idolatry and striking one\u2019s fellow Jew. This is the reason that the Torah mentions the word \u05d1\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8 specifically in connection with thee two sins that are listed here. The reason is that for sins committed in public there is no need to utter a curse as people sinning in public are not frightened of the curses either. Not only that, the court has a chance to deal with crimes/sins committed in public. This is the message in 29,28 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e2\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, we are forever obligated to deal with publicly committed offenses. Only when crimes are committed in secret do we leave punishment of the sinners to G\u2019d, i.e. \u05d4\u05e0\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4' \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, \u201csecretly committed sins are left to G\u2019d to avenge.\u201d (same verse) This includes the whole range of punishments to which the sinner had made himself liable, not only for sins carrying the death penalty.<br> You will note that the Torah does not write \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d5\u05db\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05ea \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4\u05d5, as normally when one enters another\u2019s house this does not go unobserved. Sleeping with one\u2019s mother-in-law, however, is different, as both parties usually dwell in the same house. (verse  23). Insulting father or mother (verse 16) is something normally done in one\u2019s parents\u2019 home, where strangers are not present. The same is true of someone moving boundaries in the field; (verse 17) it is done at night away from prying eyes. If the one doing it were to do it in full view of his neighbour, surely he would be challenged. The same applies to misdirecting the blind, (verse 18) or someone sleeping with a beast (verse 21). Naturally, all forbidden sexual unions are naturally performed by consenting adults, each one making sure he or she is unobserved.<br> Verse 20 speaking of someone sleeping with his father\u2019s wife (former, not his mother) is also something which normally occurs in the male\u2019s home, the place he grew up in, where he is not an intruder. Intercourse with animals clearly occurs in the privacy of the home or the animal\u2019s pen, no one wanting to take a chance at being found out in such depraved behaviour. All other incestuous couplings are presumed to take place at home and with consent of the second party.\n"}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {}, "2": {}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {}, "23": {}, "24": {}, "25": {"0": "\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, this is a blanket curse applying to all sins committed in private, the sinner making sure he is not observed."}, "3": {}, "4": {}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {"0": "'\u05d5\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05db\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5, for when they were now sworn at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyval the Torah was present before them in written format, and they were sworn to keep its commandments."}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "27": {"0": {}, "1": {}, "10": {}, "11": {}, "12": {}, "13": {}, "14": {}, "15": {}, "16": {}, "17": {}, "18": {}, "19": {"0": "\u05d4\u05de\u05d4\u05d5\u05de\u05d4, by means of the sound of thunder and hail, as in Samuel I 7,10 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e2\u05dd \u05d1\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05de\u05dd, \u201cthe Lord thundered mightily against the Philistines that day and threw them into confusion.\u201d", "1": "\u05d4\u05de\u05d2\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea, a kind of rebuke.

It was therefore possible that the Israelites might consider themselves as more numerous than those people and as militarily more powerful so that they could conquer the land of Canaan due to their military prowess and numerical superiority. Moses disabuses them of such thinking by saying that G\u2019d would not like them on account of their being numerous even if that were true. The fact is that they were less numerous than any of these seven tribes. But, there is an irrational reason for what G\u2019d does, i.e. He loves the Jewish people. 2.)

It is one of G\u2019d\u2019s attributes that He sometimes lets a long time elapse before carrying out anything He has said which was not tied to a date. Just as He remembers loving kindness performed by His creatures for 1000 generations, so, not lapsing any reward due to the descendants of a deserving ancestor, so He may decide that you are the generation which will be the beneficiary of the promise and oath mentioned.

Is it then the custom for the Torah to keep repeating things like \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05e0\u05e4\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05e4\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9?.

However, there is a profound wisdom in the sequence of the words the Torah quotes Moses as saying, one that contains an admonition to his people. Moses is using the way he phrases his report of what he did during those 40 days and how he did it, by pre-empting an argument by the Jewish people that just as his prayers had been helpful when they were in the desert, similar prayers would be equally helpful once the people were in the Holy Land and they committed a major sin. The prophets in such days, they would argue, would surely be able to act as their interlocutors then just as Moses had done while he was alive. The point Moses is making here is that at this time their atonement was only in order for G\u2019d not to be perceived as being unable to fulfill His oath of bringing Avraham\u2019s descendants to take over the land of Canaan. In other words, Israel\u2019s pardon was for the sake of not desecrating G\u2019d\u2019s Holy name. Once G\u2019d had demonstrated that He had kept His promise, and that the people concerned had been settled in the Holy Land, as promised, His Holy name would never again be in danger of being desecrated by someone citing the arguments Moses had been able to cite while the people were still in the desert. This is why Moses repeats again the wording of his prayer. He is telling the people that if his prayer had been heard, it was only on account of an irrefutable argument he had been able to advance, namely how the Egyptians and other nations would react to the Jewish people\u2019s annihilation. It follows, that if, G\u2019d forbid the Jewish people, once settled in the Holy Land, would become guilty of similar misdemeanours as had the Canaanites, they would face both death and expulsion. On the contrary, if that were to happen, the gentile nations would not point to G\u2019d\u2019s inability to keep them there as the cause of their misfortune, but they would correctly point to the disloyalty this people had demonstrated by eschewing the laws given to them by their G\u2019d, the One who had driven out the Canaanites.
