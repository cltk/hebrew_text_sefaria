Rashi interpreted that it is because ever man who went to one of David\u2019s wars signed a Gett, on the condition that if he dies, she will be expelled and she would not require \u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05dd (divorce), and all of the days he is out at war she would be considered doubtfully married. And this is a difficulty for Rabeinu Tam that if this is so, it is not \u201call men\u201d, it is only if they had brothers and did not have children. However, Rashi is not particular when he says \u201c\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05dd\u201d, rather she will not be tied down (become an Agunah)."]}}
