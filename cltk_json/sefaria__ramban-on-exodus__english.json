In times of famine He redeemed them from death and in war from the sword and provided them with wealth and honor and every good thing.  These things, like all the promises in the Torah of blessing and curse, are not meted out to a man as his due, as a reward for good deeds and punishment for sin.  They constitute miracles (of Divine grace).  Man's own deeds do not automatically give rise to favorable effects or otherwise.  But the reward and punishment alluded to in the Torah in this world are in the nature of miracles, hidden ones which the onlookers regard as the workings of nature.  But in reality they are the providential allocation of reward and punishment.  God said to Moses: I appeared to the Patriarchs as One who assists His chosen ones through the might of my hand (but without violating nature).  By My ineffable name expressing the essence of all existence (Exodus 3:14) I was not known to them to introduce innovations changing the natural course of events.

And we read more there (13:4) because I made his heart heavy (Shemot 10:1) \u2013 from this verse, said Rabbi Yochanan, the minim say that he had no chance of doing teshuvah. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish answered: \u2018let the mouths of the minim be closed, rather He laughs at mockers (Mishlei 3:34), he was warned once, and twice and three times and he did not repent, and He closes the door of teshuvah so to extract [retribution] from him what he sinned. So with the evil Pharaoh, God sent [warnings] to him five times and he did not listen to [God\u2019s] words, God said to him: \u2018you stiffened your neck and you made your own heart heavy, behold I am going to add impurity to your impurity.", "1": "And here is the answer to the question that everyone asks: If God hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, what then was his transgression [since he had no choice]? There are two answers, which both hold true: First, Pharaoh, in his wickedness, had unjustifiably treated the Jews terribly, so he was punished with the withdrawal of the path of repentance, and there are many verses regarding this in the Torah and the Writings, and he was punished by his original deeds. Secondly, only the second half of the [ten] plagues were brought upon Egypt due to Pharaoh\u2019s transgressions, as the Torah states, And Pharaoh\u2019s heart was strengthened, (Shemot 7:13, 26; 8:15), and Pharaoh hardened his heart (ibid. 8:28, 9:7). He did not want to send the Jews out of Egypt for the glory of God; rather, when the plagues increased and he was becoming too worn out to withstand them, his heart softened and he decided to send them out because of the severity of the plagues themselves, but not in order to do the will of his Creator. Therefore, God strengthened his spirit and gave courage to his heart so that His Name would be declared [throughout the world], as we read: Thus will I magnify Myself, and sanctify Myself, and I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Ad\u00f8n\u03b1i.

Or it means to say in the land of Egypt, and not in a city of Egypt, as our Sages said (Mekhilta 12:1:4), \"outside of a town.\"<br>It would have been fitting for [the verse] to say first, \"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying,\" [and then] \"This month shall be unto you\" and the remainder of the section, but Moses and Aaron stand in place of Israel, and [the verse] says \"unto you,\" referring to all the generations of Israel, and then it returns and says \"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel,\" that [Moses] should command them in the one-off command of taking the Passover sacrifice of [the generation of] Egypt on the tenth [of the month of Nisan].<br>According to its drash, \"unto you\" means that sanctification of the month requires a court of expert [judges] (Rosh Hashanah 25b), and therefore it was not written earlier, \"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel,\" for sanctification of the month applies only to Moses and Aaron and [experts] of their kind.  And the reason for, \"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months\" is that Israel will count the first month, and from there will count all the months as second and third until the completion of the year with the twelfth month, so that this will be a reminder of a great miracle, for any time that the months will be mentioned the miracle will be remembered, and therefore the months have no names in the Torah, but rather it says, \"in the third month\" (Exodus 19:1), and, \"in the second year in the second month...that the cloud was taken up\" (Numbers 10:11), and, \"in the seventh month on the first of the month, etc.\" (Numbers 29:1) and so with all of them [i.e. all verses mentioning dates].<br>And just as the Sabbath Day is remembered by our counting from it the first [day] from the Sabbath and the second [day] from the Sabbath, as I will explain (Ramban on Exodus 20:8:1), so too the Exodus from Egypt is remembered by our counting of the first month and the second and the third from our redemption, for this counting is not for [numbering] the year, for the start of our year is in Tishrei, as it is written (Exodus 34:22), \"and the feast of ingathering [i.e.  Sukkot] at the turn of the year,\" and it is written (Exodus 23:16), \"(and the feast of ingathering), at the end of the year.\"  If so, then when the month of Nisan is called the first [month] and Tishrei the seventh, the solution is that [Nisan is] the first [month] from redemption and [Tishrei is] the seventh.  This is the reason for, \"it shall be the first...to you,\" for it is not the first in the year, but it is the first for you, for such is it called as a remembrance of our redemption.<br>And our Sages have already mentioned this topic, and said that the names of the months came with us from Babylonia (Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah 6a), for at the start we had no names.  The reason for this is that at the start the order of [the months] was as a remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt, but when we left Babylonia and the verse was fulfilled (Jeremiah 16:14-15), \"that it shall no more be said: 'As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,' but: \u2018As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north,\" we returned to calling the months by the names by which they were called in Babylonia, as a reminder that there we stood and from there the Lord drew us out.  For the names Nisan, Iyar, and the others are Persian names and are only found in the books of the Babylonian prophets (Zechariah 1:7, Ezra 6:15, Nehemiah 1:1) and in Megilat Esther (3:7).  Therefore the verse says, \"In the first month, which is the month Nisan,\" similar to, \"They cast pur, that is, the lot\" (ibid.).  And until today the nations in the lands of Persia and Media call [the months] Nisan and Tishrei and all the rest like us.

But our Rabbis refer to the word \"Totafos\" as something that is placed on ones head, and they are the real owners of the language and its fitting to accept their explanation. And the verse says \"Totafos\" with the letter \"vuv\" at the end (i.e. its commonly spelled missing that vuv) in order to instruct you that there are many compartments on the Tefillin just as we have recieved this tradition on how to make them from our holy forefathers who saw the prophets and the early ones doing so all the way until Moshe Rabbeinu.

[The above is] the language of Rashi. And it is also the understanding of Rabbi Avraham (a.k.a Ibn Ezra): Because the reason that 'Hashem did not lead them on the path [through] the land of the Philistines' was because 'it was close' and they would regret [leaving] and return to Egypt immediately. But according to my understanding, if it is like their words (Rashi and Ibn Ezra) 'Because Hashem said' would have been first [in the verse], but the verse says \"Hashem led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines...for God said: \u2018Lest the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.\u2019\". But the correct [understanding] is that it is saying \"Hashem led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines\" which is \"close\" and [it would be] good to lead them on that path, \"because Hashem said, 'Lest the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.'\"", "1": "And the reason for war was that they would pass through to path of the land of the Philistines and the Philistines would not let them pass in peace, and then they would return to Egypt, but on the path of the wilderness, they would not see war until they were in their land; in the land of Sicon and Og, kings of the Emorites that was given to them, and they would be far from Egypt at that time. And the war with Amalek in Rifidim was not worthwhile to return because of it, because they were that passing through [the Amalekims land] but [rather the Amelekim] came from its land and fought with them because of their hatred for them and if they had conceived of returning to Egypt, it would not have helped because [the Amelekim] would have fought them on the road. And also they were [already] far from Egypt on the crooked path that they went on and they didn't know another way [to return]. And the language of Rashi: When they see war - for example, the wars of the Cananim and the Amelekim, if they had went on a straight path, they would have returned. Just like when [Hashem] led them on a crooked path they said, 'Let us take initiative and return to Egypt', if they had went on a simple [path], all the more so [would they have returned]. [The following is a quote from] Michilta. And the reason it says, \"God led them not...But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness\", is when they traveled from Succot, the pillar of cloud began to go before them, and it did not go by the way of the land of the Philistines, but rather went by the way of the wilderness of Eitam and Yisrael went after it. And the cloud rested in Eitam and they camped there, and [Eitam] is on the border of the wilderness. "}, "2": "And the for [saying] 'And Bnei Yisrael went up armed' - [as if] to say even though Hashem led them around [by] the way of the wilderness, they were scared maybe the Philistines would come upon them, those that lived in the cities close to them, and [therefore] they were armed like those who go to war. And there are those that say [that the reason for the phrase is] that the verse is telling us that they left 'with a raised hand' and they considered themselves redeemed people, and they did not walk like slaves who ran away.", "3": "\"And Hashem walked before them during the day\" - They already said (Bereishit Rabbah 51:2) that \"Every place that is says '<i>Va'Hahsem</i>' (lit. and Hashem) [it means] him and his court. The Holy, one blessed is He, was with them during the day and his court [was with them] at night.\" If so, the verse is explaining that Hashem dwelt in the cloud and He went before them by day in the pillar of cloud, and at night, his court dwelt in the pillar of fire to light [the way] for them, like the reason [behind the verse] (Numbers 14:14) \"inasmuch as Thou LORD art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over them, and Thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night\". And I saw in <i>Eleh Shemos Rabbah</i> (Shemot Rabbah 19:6) \"'For ye shall not go out in haste, Neither shall ye go by flight; For the LORD will go before you' (Isaiah 52:12). [This verse implies] in the past My court and I would get before you, as it says, '<i>Va'Hashem</i> went before them by day' but in the future,  I will go alone [before you], as it says, (Isaiah 52:12) 'For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rearward.'\" And the secret [behind] this Midrash is as I have mentioned, because in the first redemption (i.e. the one from Egypt) the Holy one, blessed is He, was with them by day and his court was with them by night. But in the future (lit. the coming future) you will raise [away] the attribute of His court with mercy, and Hashem will walk before them, the singular Hashem, because 'the God of Israel will be your rearward' and 'But the night shineth as the day; The darkness is even as the light.' (Psalms 139:12) because everything [will be dealt] with the unique attribute of mercy. And Rabbi Avraham (a.k.a. Ibn Ezra) says: Because the verse is speaking like the language of people, because the power of Hashem and His messenger [are whom] went with Israel like [the verse] \"That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses\" (Isaiah 63:12) . And the truth that it is [actually] like [the verse] '' but not like Rabbi Avraham understood from it, and it says so (i.e. proves my point) \"So didst Thou lead Thy people, To make Thyself a glorious name.\" (Isaiah 63:12)"}, "8": {"0": {"0": "...

And I hereby enlighten your eyes: for each blessing that contains mention of God's royalty is like this, for the Sages gave honor to His Kingship over the world, and that from this Kingship He made us holy and gives us [food and other things to make blessings on]. And the blessings which are close to another blessing, which do not mention Royalty, are in the second person (presence) ... and this is why the prayer \"Aleinu\" is all in the third person (hidden), because it is said before the Kind of all Kings.

And Rashi explained: Rather this is what he said to them, \"'Evening and you shall know' that His hand has the power to give you your desire and He will give you meat; but not with a radiant countenance will He give it to you, because you have not asked it properly, [since it was] from a full stomach. But the bread for which you have asked properly, out of necessity \u2014 when it falls in the morning you will behold the glory of His countenance, because He will make it fall for you in a manner that is indicative of His love \u2014 in the morning, whilst there is yet time to prepare it.\" But it is not correct that it should state, \"And morning you will see the glory of the Lord,\" because He will start in the morning with the present for them of the manna \u2014 as what glory of God is there in this? And [it is incorrect] also because next to it, [it states] \"in His hearing your complaints.\"                 <b>And this midrash</b> of our rabbis (that is Rashi's source) is not an explanation of, \"and you will see the glory of the Lord.\" But [rather] they said this because He divided their sustenance for them into two times of the day and He did not give it all in the morning. And so did they say in the Mekhilta (here), \"'And Moshe said, \"In the Lord's giving to you in the evening\"' (verse 8) \u2014 from here, you learn that He gave them the pheasants with a dark countenance. And the manna that they asked as was fit, He gave them with a radiant countenance\"; that is to say in the morning. <b>And Rabbi</b> Avraham (Ibn Ezra) said: \"And morning\" relates to the [previous] verse. As since they said, \"that you took us out of Egypt,\" [Moshe] said [that] God will make two signs for you, so that you will know that He took you out from there \u2014 the first in the evening that day and the second on the next day in the morning. And it would have been fitting that it would have stated, \"evening and morning and you will see that it was the Lord who took you out\" \u2014 since \"and morning\" does not relate to \"and you will see the glory of the Lord\"; as they saw the glory on that same day. And this too does not appear to be [correct]. <b>And what is correct</b> in my eyes is that the wonder of the manna was very great: Since He blew the pheasants from the sea with a wind that traveled from Him, like the [natural] way of the world; but the manna was created for them now, a new creation in the sky, like the matter of the creation story. And this is what [the sages] said about it (Avot 5:6), that it was created at twilight (before the last day of creation). And hence the verse stated, today in the evening with this sign that I shall make for you, you will know that He took you out of the land of Egypt, as He will set up a table for you in the wilderness, but with the great miracle that He will do for you in the morning, you will see the glory of His kingship, about which who is the power in the heavens and the earth who can do like His acts and like His great deeds? As through the great and wondrous acts that God does, He show His glory; as in the matter of \"to gather all of the nations and the languages and they shall come and see My glory\" (Isaiah 66:18), and it is written (Isaiah 66:19), \"and they shall recount My glory,\" and so [too] many [examples]. And this is the opinion of Onkelos who said, \"they will see the glory of the Lord\"; and he did not translate it as \"[the glory] will be revealed.\" <b>And know</b> that there is a great matter in the manna. Our rabbis hinted it in Tractate Yoma 75b, \"'The bread of powerful ones a man ate' (Psalms 78 25) \u2014 the bread that the ministering angels eat,\" These are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael said to him, \"And do the ministering angels eat bread? And is it not already written (Deuteronomy 9:9), '\"I did not eat bread and I did not drink water.\"' Rather 'bread of powerful ones (<i>abirim</i>) [means] bread that is absorbed [directly] into the limbs (<i>evarim</i>).\" And this matter that Rabbi Akiva said is that the existence of the ministering angels is from the radiance of the Divine Presence, and so did they expound (Exodus Rabbah 32:4), \"'You give life (<i>mechayeh</i>) to them all' (Nehemiah 9:6) \u2014 [You are] nourishment (<i>michiah</i>) to them all.\" And about it, it is stated (Ecclesiastes 11:7), \"And sweet is the light\" \u2014 that they grasped from the light good reasoning. And the manna is from the products of the higher light that became physical through the will of its Creator, may He be blessed (Zohar Balak 208). And [so] it comes out that the  [people who ate] the manna and the ministering angels were nourished from [the same] thing. And Rabbi Yishmael caught him because [the angels'] existence is not from something that became physical from the products of the upper light, as behold, their existence is from the upper light itself. And because of this [the Israelites that ate manna] were able to create whatever taste they wanted, as the soul clings to the higher ones in its thought. And the resting will find life and obtain favor from in front of Him (based on Proverbs 8:35). <b>And they said</b> in the Mechilta Shemot 16:25, \"Today you will not find it, but you will find it in the world to come.\" And this can be understood in two ways: That we should say that there will [also] be in the world to come those whose level has not reached to always enjoy the radiance of the Divine Presence. And [so] their existence will be dependent upon that which is made physical from the radiance of the Divine presence \u2014 like the generation of the wilderness who grasped the radiance of the Divine Presence at the Sea, as they said (Mechilta Shemot 16:2), \"A maidservant saw upon the Sea what Yechezkel the prophet did not see, and from that time, their soul became elevated to subsist from its products, which is the manna. But more correct is that the verse hints to the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Chisma with the word, \"today\": that the existence of those that will be in the world to come will be from the basis of the manna, which will be from the higher radiance, as they said (Berakhot 17a), \"There is no eating and no drinking [in the world to come]... but rather the righteous ones sit and their crowns are upon their heads and they enjoy the radiance of the Divine Presence.\"  And those in the world to come will exist from their enjoyment of the radiance of the Divine Presence through their clinging to Him with the crown that is on their heads. And the crown is the attribute [of God] that is called like this, that the verse spoke about \u2014 \"and the Lord of hosts will be for a crown of beauty\" (Isaiah 28:5). And about it, it is stated (Song of Songs 3:11), \"with the crown that his mother crowned him.\" And they hinted [in the Mechilta above] to the existence of those that will be in the world to come and they hinted to the main idea [behind the] manna. <b>And the verse stated</b> (Psalms 78:23-25), \"And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven; And He caused manna to rain upon them to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven: The bread of powerful ones a man ate.\" And so [too] it stated (Psalms 105:40), \"and He satiated them with the bread of the skies;\" [such] that we see from this that this 'grain' was in the heavens and He brought it down to them with the opening of its doors. And this is what I have explained \u2014 that the light became physical; as about the upper light does the verse speak in such a way, \"the skies opened and I saw the visions of God\" (Ezekile 1:1). Or [it is possible that the physical form] was already in the heavens, as per their statement (Avot 5:6), that [manna] was created at twilight.

It says in the text, \"who took you out of Eretz Mitzrayim,\" for He took you out of there to teach you about the reality and the desire [of Hashem], for with His knowledge and providence we left there, and to teach about the newness, for from the beginning of the world, not a thing has changed from His nature, and to teach you about what He can do, which will teach you about His uniqueness, like it says above [in Shmot 9:14], \"so that you will know that there is no one like Me in all the land.\" And this is the reason for [the phrase] \"Who took you out\" - for they know of and bear witness to all of these [ideas.]", "1": "An earth alter you will do to me.
