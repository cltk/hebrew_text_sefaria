To the \u05d9\u05b8\u05dd (yam), west, and the south His possession (Deuteronomy 33:23)? It means that everyplace of \u05d1 (bet) is \u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05da (barukh), blessed, and this is: filled with the \u05d1\u05bc\u05b4\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\u05ea (birkat), blessing, of YHWH. From there it gives to drink those who need it. It was from this filling that He sought advice. What is this like? A king wanted to build his palace among great cliffs. He mined into the bedrock and uncovered a great spring of living water. The king then said, \u201cSince I have flowing water, I will plant a garden. Then I will delight in it, and so will all the world.\u201d Therefore it is written And I was by Him an intimate, I was His delight day after day playing before Him at all times (Proverbs 8:30). Torah is saying, \u201cFor two thousand years I was in the lap of the blessed Holy One as His delight.\u201d Therefore the verse reads: day after day [lit., \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd  (yom yom), a day, a day]. Each day of the blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written, For a thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday gone (Psalms 90:4, cf. BT Sanhedrin 97a).? Hence, thereafter: at times\u2014as it is said, [playing before Him] at all times. And the rest is \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05dd (le-olam), forevermore. Thus it is said I defer My anger, and for My praise will I restrain it for you (Isaiah 48:9). What is My praise? As it is written, A David song of praise. Let me exalt You, [my God the king] (Psalms 145:1-2). Why is this praise? Because I will exalt You. And what is this exaltation? Let me bless Your name \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05dd (le-olam), forevermore (ibid.).", "1": "... I am the one that planted this tree/ilan, [for] all the world to delight in, and I hammered out all/kol with him (the tree), and I called his name \u201cthe Whole/All /hakol\u201d, for all depends on him, and all comes out from him. And all are needing him, and through/to him they gaze and for him they wait. And from there bloom/grow the souls in joy. Alone was I when I made him . . . for in the time when I hammered out my earth, I planted and rooted this tree in her, and I rejoiced together [with him] and I rejoiced in them.", "2": "R\u2019 R\u2019chumai said: From your word we learn that the Holy One created the need of this world before the heavens. He said to him: Thus so. ", "3": "R\u2019 Yanai said: The earth was created before the heavens, as it says, \u201c[in the day of YHVH Elohim\u2019s making] earth and heavens\u201d [Gn 2:4]. They said to him: But isn\u2019t it written, \u201c[Elohim created] the heavens (first) and the earth\u201d? He said to them: To what does the thing compare? To a king who took possession of a beautiful, precious thing, and it wasn\u2019t complete . . . He said, \u201cI will complete it and prepare its mounting and its setting, and then  I will call out its name over it . . . \u201d", "4": "R\u2019 Amorai said: Gan Eden, where is it? He said to them: In the earth.", "5": "... \u201cThe advantage/profit/surplus/yitron of the land/arets over All /bakol is a king\u201d [Ec 5:8] \u2013 And what is yitron? A place from which is carved out the earth/arets . . . And what is this \u201cearth\u201d? That from her was carved out the Whole /hakol, and from him (hakol) was carved out heavens, and he is the throne of the Holy One, and he is a precious stone, and he is the sea of wisdom. ", "6": "And corresponding to her (the earth) is the deep-blue/t\u2019cheilet of the tsitsit (the corner fringes on a prayer shawl). For R\u2019 Meir said: How is t\u2019cheilet different from all kinds of colors? Because t\u2019cheilet resembles the sea and the sea resembles the firmament and the firmament resembles the throne of glory, as it is said, \u201cAnd they saw Israel\u2019s God and under His feet [was something] like sapphire brick-work and like the essence of the heavens for purity\u201d [Ex 24:10] and it says, \u201clike the appearance/mar\u2019eh of sapphire stone, a likeness of a throne / d\u2019mut kisei\u2019\u201d [Ez 1:26]. ", "7": "And what would the tree be that you spoke of? He said to him: [It is] the powers/kochot of the Holy One, this on back of this, and they resemble/domin a tree: just as this tree, by means of the waters, brings out fruit, even so the Holy One by means of the waters increases the powers of the tree. And what are these waters of the Holy One? They are wisdom, and they are the souls/n\u2019shamot of the righteous that bloom/grow/fly/por\u2019chin from the spring unto the great channel. And he goes up and joins with the tree, and by what means does [the tree] bloom/grow? By means of Israel, [for] when they are righteous and good, Shekhinah rests among them, and through their deeds she rests in the bosom of the Holy One, and makes them fruitful and increases them."}}
