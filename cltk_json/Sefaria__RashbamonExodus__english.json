The former were agents of spiritually negative forces, known in our parlance as \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4, the prophets performed their miracles by invoking the spiritually positive forces, G\u2019d in heaven. The people who had made the golden calf, or who had seen it emerge from the mould, proclaimed that the same force which had produced the golden calf had also been instrumental in freeing the Jewish people from the enslavement by the Egyptians. They implied that such teraphim may sometimes be the embodiment of holy spirit, other times of Satan\u2019s spirit. They insisted that seeing that the calf had materialised at the time when the Jewish people were in need of a replacement for Moses, this was proof that it was a replacement for Moses, and if they would now carry the golden calf in front of them, or have it walk in front of them, this would be equivalent having the holy spirit walking ahead of them. [I fleshed out the author\u2019s words. Ed.] We know that Lavan (Genesis 31,30) accused Yaakov of having stolen his \u201cgods\u201d which was the description he gave to his \u201cteraphim.\u201d He himself had admitted that Yaakov\u2019s G\u2019d had enriched him, and yet for himself he paid heed to these teraphim. If G\u2019d allowed the spiritually negative forces to appear as possessing divine powers, He did so in order to test the loyalty of the Jewish people who had been warned not to have any truck with witchcraft or those who practiced this art. Moses spells all this out in Deuteronomy 13,4.

It is totally incompatible with the attitude Moses displayed at the burning bush when the very thought of seeing something Divine filled him with fear and he was afraid to look. (Exodus 3,6). There can be no question but that what motivated Moses to formulate the above request was only that G\u2019d would fulfil his two wishes, 1) to distinguish him individually, and 2) to personally travel with the people. To this effect he added \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea \u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05da, referring to previous occasions when a covenant had been concluded between G\u2019d and Avraham, and as a sign of this Avraham had witnessed the entire procedure of the covenant between the pieces in Genesis 15,18. Moses, as Avraham before him, asked for some sign that the covenant would endure. We read about this occurring in 34,6 and 10 where Moses has a special personal revelation which includes G\u2019d revealing to him 13 of His attributes, each of which is of relevance when inducing forgiveness and repentance. In verse 10 in that chapter G\u2019d promises to make this special relationship manifest by hitherto unheard of miracles. The distinction G\u2019d provided for Moses personally was such that the people did not dare approach him as the light radiating from his forehead blinded them (34,30) \n"}, "18": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05df, there I will explain to you My attributes."}, "19": {}, "2": {"0": "\u05e4\u05df \u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05da, as if the Torah had written auchalcha, i.e. \u201cI will consume you.\u201d G\u2019d has been described elsewhere as \u201cconsuming fire\u201d (Deuteronomy 4,24)"}, "20": {}, "21": {}, "22": {"0": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9, after I shall have passed before you during the concluding of the covenant you will be enabled to see this aspect of Me.

Moses is described as hearing the voice of G\u2019d originating from the area between the extended wings of these two figurines.

Anyone who pays careful attention to the words of our Creator will not depart in his exegesis from that of my grandfather Rabbi Shlomoh (Rashi). Most of the laws of the Torah which have been attributed through exegesis as being derived from the text of the written Torah are very close to the plain meaning of the written text. The basic approach to his exegesis was to derive meanings from superfluous words or letters, or from missing words or letters in the text of the written Torah.

Just as the stones are pressed together to remove them as obstacles, so Pharaoh squeezed the Israelites so that they could not offer any resistance. Compare also Jeremiah 34,11 \u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05e9\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05e4\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea, they \u201ccompressed\u201d them into becoming male and female slaves. Concerning the grammatical principles underlying the use of the reflexive conjugation mitpael, every time this conjugation appears it has the letter \u05ea preceding the first root letter, except the ones that have that letter at the end instead of at the beginning. Examples of the former are Psalms 94,4 \u05d9\u05ea\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05df Words such as \u05d9\u05ea\u05d1\u05e8\u05da, \u05d9\u05ea\u05d2\u05d3\u05dc or in Ezekiel 38,23 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05d3\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9, or Jeremiah 9,23 \u05d9\u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05dc, or \u05de\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05dc in Exodus 10,2. The author lists a few more examples, showing that all of the letters of the aleph bet except the 7 letters \u05d3'\u05d6\u05d8 \u05e1'\u05e5 \u05e9'\u05ea, follow this pattern. When the first root letter is either a \u05e9 or a \u05ea, the letter \u05ea is appended at the end instead of at the beginning. The exception is a word whose root begins with the letter \u05e1. One such example is our verse, the root being \u05e1\u05dc. The basic meaning is parallel to Numbers 16,13 \u05ea\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, where the word \u05ea\u05e1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05e8 is derived from the root \u05e9\u05e8. In examples such as \u05d9\u05e9\u05ea\u05d1\u05d7, \u05d9\u05e9\u05ea\u05de\u05e8 or \u05de\u05e9\u05ea\u05db\u05e8, all of which have roots beginning with the letter \u05e9, the letter \u05ea signaling the conjugation \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc is deferred until after the first root letter. In roots commencing with the letter \u05d6 or \u05e6, no such letter \u05ea signaling the reflexive conjugation appears at all. Instead, after the letter \u05e6 the letter \u05d8 is added to show us that we deal with the reflexive conjugation. Well known examples of these constructions are found in Genesis 44,16 \u05e0\u05e6\u05d8\u05d3\u05e7 from the root \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7, and Joshua 9,12 \u05d4\u05e6\u05d8\u05d9\u05d9\u05d3\u05e0\u05d5 from the root \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3, provisions. Concerning the words with the first root letter \u05d6, the letter signaling the reflexive conjugation is a \u05d3, as in Daniel 2,9 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d3\u05de\u05e0\u05ea\u05d5\u05df. The letters \u05d3-\u05d8-\u05ea, by themselves when they appear at the beginning of the word, do not get an additional letter to indicate that the construction in which they appear is a reflexive conjugation. A prominent example of this is Numbers 7,89 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e2 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8, where the Torah did not write \u05de\u05ea\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8. Another such example is Leviticus 21,4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d5, where because the root \u05d8\u05de\u05d0 begins with the letter \u05d8 the Torah did not write \u05d9\u05ea\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, although the verb is in the reflexive mode, of course. The same is true in Samuel II 22,27 where the word \u05ea\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc in the line \u05d5\u05e2\u05dd \u05e2\u05e7\u05e9 \u05ea\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc, does not have another letter \u05ea at the beginning in order to signal that the verb is in the reflexive mode.
