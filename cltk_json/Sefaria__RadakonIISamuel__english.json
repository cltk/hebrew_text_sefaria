Even in the days of David the Jebusites remained in Jerusalem, just as they had remained there after the conquest by Yehudah, as it is written \u201c\u2026but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.\u201d (Yehoshua 15:63) They lived as a subject people, paying a tax of servitude to Yehudah and Benyamin in order to keep their homes, vineyards and fields. This field and threshing floor belonged to Aravnah the Jebusite and he wanted to give them to David, but he did not want to accept them except as a full purchase. Even after David conquered the stronghold, he allowed the Jebusites who had been there originally under tax and servitude to stay in the city of Jerusalem until Shlomo built the Holy Temple. These Jebusites were not one of the seven nations, but rather Phillistines descended from Avimelech as I explained in the book of Yehoshua. Therefore it was permissible to leave them settled in the land on the condition that they not cause others to sin, as it says \u201cThey shall not dwell in your land, lest they cause you to sin against Me\u2026\u201d (Shemot 23:33) So long as they are not sinning, meaning that they have accepted upon themselves the seven Noachide laws, it is permissible to leave them in he land.

Since he was now king over all of Israel he went to Jerusalem to conquer the citadel of Zion because they had a tradition that Zion was the head of kingship in Israel and only one who was king over all of Israel would conquer. Unto this day there had not been full kingship in Israel because Shaul\u2019s kingship was not permanently established. unless you remove the blind and the lame \u2013 Yonatan translates this phrase as \u2018unless you remove the sinners and the wicked who say that David will not come here.\u2019 We find in the rabbinic literature that the men of Yevus said to Avraham \u2018make a covenant with us that your descendants will not inherit the city of Yevus, and we will sell you the Machpela cave. He did so, and the men of Yevus made bronze idols upon which they wrote the oath and then placed in the city square. When Israel came into the land they were unable to enter the city because of the oath, as it says \u201cAnd the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem\u2026\u201d (Shoftim 1:21) When David became king he wanted to enter there but they did not allow him to, as it says \u201c\u2026you shall not come here\u2026\u201d (Shmuel II 5:6) They said to him \u2018you are not able until you remove these idols upon which the oath and covenant are written\u2019 as it says \u201c\u2026unless you remove the blind and the lame\u2026\u201d (ibid.) which are the idols that have eyes but cannot see, ears but cannot hear, legs but cannot walk  - those which David\u2019s soul loaths and which he hates to hear of them and those that worship them, as it says \u201cTherefore they say, \u2018The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\u2019\u201d (Shmuel II 5:8) David said to his men \u2018who ever goes up first and removes the idols will be my chief officer. Yoav went up and became his chief officer, as it says \u201c\u2026and Yoav the son of Zeruiah ascended first and became a chief.\u201d (Divre HaYamim I 11:6) Afterward David purchased the city of Yevus on behalf of all Israel with gold, with an eternal deed as an everlasting possession for six hundred gold pieces, as it says \u201cAnd David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred.\u201d (Divre HaYamim I 21:25) They further said that these two idols were at the top of the tower called Tzinor (see Shmuel II 5:8). One was blind in reference to Yitzchak and the other lame in reference to Yaakov and in their mouth was the oath which Avraham swore to Avimelech, as it says \u201cAnd now, swear to me here by God, that you will not lie to me or to my son or to my grandson\u2026\u201d (Bereshit 21:23) Therefor Israel did not conquer it when they conquered Jerusalem because the grandson of Avimelech was still alive. But in the days of David he had already died and the oath was nullified. The wise man R\u2019 Avraham ibn Ezra explained the phrase \u201c\u2026unless you remove (hisircha)\u2026\u201d (Shmuel II 5:6) as hasir that it to say turn towards, meaning even if the blind and the lame turn to fight you then they will keep you out.
