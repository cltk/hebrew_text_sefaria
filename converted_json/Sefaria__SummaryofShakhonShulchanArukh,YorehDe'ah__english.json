The two  answers given are the a) the meat was to be roasted or D) it was rinsed in fruit  juice.

The answer is that nevertheless, the non-salted one is  not considered roseiach enough to release blood for here the only problem is  because of blood that the poultry releases and may be absorbed in the fish.

This is not similar to the case of Rashi in section 69 where we are stringent and require the klipah to be removed. There the reason is because the meat is in a vessel without holes in it, and is sitting in the tzir. Over here, there is no tzir since the meat is in a vessel with holes.

Another possibility is because here we are dealing  with a case of a vessel with holes, in which any other way would make it  prohibited even post facto even according to the Rema.

The Maharshal holds that re-washing  and re-salting it won\u2019t help. However, according to the Rema one should go back  and re-wash and re-salt it, and if it was cooked without a second washing one can  permit it in a case of great loss. According to everyone, if the meat was washed  off, thus closing it's pores, and then falls into tzir, a second washing and salting  won\u2019t help, for now it absorbs the tzir   ", "13": "[38] The reason is because during the first twelve hours we rule that it is releasing  tzir even if it is not a case of great loss. So we can permit it in a case of great loss and say that as it expels its tzir it will expel blood as well. However, after twelve  hours it is forbidden even in a case of great loss.

One should just  remove the klipah from what is sticking out of the tzir.  ", "21": "[46] The view of the Rema should be followed that if it went through the required  salting period and it is not a case of great loss, or if it is after twelve hours, it is  forbidden and a second salting will not help even if a great loss is involved.

Nevertheless, one need not be  more stringent than to remove the klipah from the place where it touched the  ground in the tzir. This is because we are unsure if the ground is considered to  be a vessel with holes and may then be rectified with another salting, or if is  considered a vessel without holes in which a second salting will not help.  Furthermore, if meat that had already expelled all its blood fell into tzir that is on  the ground, in which case it would absorb the tzir even in a vessel with holes, it  therefore becomes forbidden.

If it did not then it is forbidden even post facto.

The practical difference is that if the head was salted with meat after It had released all its blood and tzir, thereby not allowing for us to say \u201cas it absorbed, so will it release\u201d, even so it is permitted for it did not absorb since the bone is acting as a barrier.

The explanation is that the heart is very smooth and  doesn\u2019t really absorb blood, therefore to the heart this blood is  considered as blood that was released.
