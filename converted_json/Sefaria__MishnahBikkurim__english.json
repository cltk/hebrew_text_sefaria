One who plants in one's own property and there are private or public roads that are planted in the middle does not bring. Rabbi Judah says, in that case, one does bring.", "1": "For what reason does one not bring? For it says (Exodus 23:19), \"The first fruits of your land\" [implying], all that is grown must be entirely from your land. Sharecroppers, renters, <i>sikrikon</i> [violent individuals who acquired fields and houses by use or threat of force, including murder], and thieves do not bring for the same reason, for it says, \"The first fruits of your land.\"", "10": "One who buys three trees in a fellow's property, brings and recites.

One does not bring <i>Bikkurim</i> before <i>Atseret</i> [ Shavuot, the harvest festival].

And when he prays by himself, he says [in place of, \"the God of our fathers\"] \"the God of the fathers of Israel.\" And when he is in the synagogue, he says \"the God of your fathers.\" And if his mother was from Israel, he says \"the God of our fathers.\"", "4": "Rabbi Eli'ezer ben Ya'akov says, a woman who is the daughter of converts cannot marry into the <i>Kohen</i> class, unless her mother is an Israelite; [this ruling applies to] both converts and freed slaves, and even after ten generations [from the original convert/freed slave], until their mother is an Israelite.

They both require removal [from one's home], while Rabbi Shimon exempts.  Any amount of them [when mixed with normal food] is prohibited to eaten in Jerusalem.

It is forbidden as <i>Kilayim</i> [the product of forbidden crossbreeding or working of certain animals with one another] with a wild animal and with a domesticated animal.  If one writes that his wild animal or domesticated animal will pass to his child, he did not write over the <i>Koi</i>.  If one said \"I am hereby a Nazirite if it is a wild animal or a domesticated animal,\" one becomes a Nazirite.  And in all other matters, it is similar to a wild animal and to a domesticated animal, and requires ritual slaughter like both of them, and imparts impurity as <i>Nevelah</i>, and [one is liable for eating] a limb from it [while it is still] alive like both of them.

All of the above is for <i>Terumah</i> and <i>Ma\u2019aser</i>, but not for <i>Bikkurim</i>.", "3": "<i>Bikkurim</i> has qualities that neither <i>Terumah</i> nor <i>Ma\u2019aser</i> have: that <i>Bikkurim</i> may be designated while still in the ground and a person may make their entire field into <i>Bikkurim</i> and one is responsible for their end [i.e., bringing them to Jerusalem], and they require a sacrifice, singing, waving, and staying over the night [in Jerusalem].", "4": "<i>Terumat Ma\u2019aser</i> [a tenth of the tithe given to a Levite which must, in turn, be given to a <i>Kohen</i> and which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by <i>Kohanim</i> or their household] is similar to <i>Bikkurim</i> in two ways, and to <i>Terumah</i> in two ways.  It may be taken from pure produce to [permit] impure produce [to be eaten], and [it may be taken] from produce that is not in proximity [to the produce it is making permissible], like <i>Bikkurim</i>.  And it makes what is on the threshing floor forbidden [before it is separated], and it has a required amount, like <i>Terumah</i>.", "5": "A citron is similar to a fruit tree in three ways, and to a vegetable in one way.  It is similar to a fruit tree in that [it is obligated in] <i>Orlah</i> [the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, the consumption or usage of which is forbidden] and [<i>Neta</i>] <i>Reva'i</i> [the fruit of a tree in the fourth year after its planting, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there], and the Sabbatical year.  It is similar to a vegetable in one way, in that its <i>Ma\u2019aser</i> time is determined by when it is picked; these are the words of Rabban Gamliel.  Rabbi Eliezer says, it is similar to a fruit tree in all ways.", "6": "Human [lit., biped] blood is similar to animal blood with regard to the laws of agricultural impurity, and like insect blood in that one is not liable [for its consumption].", "7": "A <i>Koi</i> [animal of ambiguous status, exhibiting characteristics of wild and domesticated animals] is similar to a wild animal in some ways, and is similar to a domestic animal in other ways, and is similar to both in some ways, and is like neither in other ways.", "8": "How is it similar to a wild animal? [If slaughtered], its blood requires burial as that of a wild animal and it may not be slaughtered on a Festival; though if slaughtered, its blood should not be covered.  Its [prohibited] fats cause impurity as a <i>Nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] like a wild animal, and its impurity is doubtful and a firstborn donkey cannot be redeemed through it.", "9": "How is it similar to a domesticated animal? Its [prohibited] fats are prohibited like that of a domesticated animal, while eating of it doesn't induce <i>Karet</i> [to be cut off, spiritually, from the Jewish nation]. It cannot be purchased with tithe money to be eaten in Jerusalem. [The <i>Kohanim</i>] are entitled to its shank, cheeks, and stomach; Rabbi Eliezer exempts this, [due to the law] that if one possesses an item, it is incumbent on the other [who desires it] to prove his claim to it."}, "2": {"0": "How does one designate the <i>Bikkurim</i> [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the <i>Kohen</i>]? A person goes to one's field and sees a date that is bearing fruit, a bunch [of grapes] that is bearing fruit, or a pomegranate that is bearing fruit, and ties it with a string and says, \"Behold these are <i>Bikkurim</i>.\" Rabbi Shimon says, even so, he reiterates and declares them <i>Bikkurim</i> once they have been picked from the ground.", "1": "How do they bring up the first-fruits? All the cities in the region (ma\u2019amad) gather together to the main city of the region and sleep overnight on the streets of the city rather than going into the houses. They rise early in the morning and the appointed supervisor says \u201cRise!

When it comes from the Land [of Israel]. If it doesn't come from the Land [of Israel], it's not like the <i>Bikkurim</i>.", "11": "Why do we say that the <i>Bikkurim</i> are like the property of a <i>Kohen</i>? Because he can buy with them slaves, land, or an impure animal, and a creditor takes them to pay a debt, and a women takes them to pay her marriage contract, [as the <i>Bikkurim</i> may be used] like a Torah scroll. And Rabbi Yehudah says, they are only given to a <i>Chaver</i> [one who scrupulously observes tithes and purity laws], [and only] as a gift. And the Sages say they are given to those [priests] of the watch, and they divide them among themselves, as sanctified Temple items.", "2": "Those who were close would bring dates and grapes and the far ones would bring dried figs and raisins. A bull would go before them and its horns would be plated with gold and it would have a olive wreath around its head. The flute would play before them until they got close to Jerusalem. Once they got close to Jerusalem, they would send ahead of them [a messenger] and adorned their <i>Bikkurim</i>. The overseers and the officers and the treasurers would go out to greet them; in accordance with the stature of those coming in would they go out. All the artisans of Jerusalem would stand before them and greet them, \"Our brothers from so-and-so, come in peace!\"", "3": "The flute would continue playing before them until they arrived at the Temple Mount. Once they arrived at the Temple Mount, even Agripas the King would carry his basket on his shoulder and enter until he reached the courtyard. Once they got to the courtyard, the Levites would speak in song (Psalms 30:2), \"I will extol you, O Lord, because you have raised me and not allowed my enemies to rejoice over me.\"", "4": "The young birds on the baskets would be <i>Olot</i> [offerings burnt entirely upon the altar] and what was in their hands, they gave to the <i>Kohanim</i>.", "5": "With the basket still on one's shoulder, one would recite from \"I declare today to the Lord my God\" (Deuteronomy 26:3-10) until finishing the entire passage. Rabbi Judah says, until \"My father was a wandering Aramean\" (Deut. 26:5). Once one gets to \"My father was a wandering Aramean\", one takes the basket off one's shoulder and holds it by one's lip. The priest places his hand under it and waves it. He then recites from \"My father was a wandering Aramean\" until finishing the entire passage and rests [the basket] beside the altar and prostrates and leaves.", "6": "In the beginning, anyone who knew how to read would read and anyone else would have it read for him. [Then,] people were reticent to bring and they declared that it would be read for those who know how to read and those who do not know.", "7": "Wealthy people would bring their <i>Bikkurim</i> in baskets of silver and of gold. Poor people would bring theirs in reed baskets of woven willow stems. Both the baskets and the <i>Bikkurim</i> were given to the priests.", "8": "Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas said, one may adorn the <i>Bikkurim</i> [basket with species] outside of the seven species.

The addition to the <i>Bikkurim</i> are eaten in ritual purity, and are exempted from <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain whether tithes were already taken].
