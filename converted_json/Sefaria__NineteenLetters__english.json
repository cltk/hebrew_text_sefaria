You found me so changed in my religious views and practices that, despite your habitual tolerance, you could not suppress the questions which rose, as it were, spontaneously to your lips, \"since when?\" and \"Why?\" As answer I gave you a whole series of accusations against Judaism, concerning which my eyes had been Opened by reading and contact with the world since I had left home and parents.", "10": "Should one not rather, if one is a Jew, consistently carry out these notions, instead of attaching oneself to such contradictory principles, by which nothing can be attained except capricious, fortuitous patchwork ? ", "11": "And, besides, for this very reform, everything is lacking, unity, legally constituted legislative bodies, authority. All of these efforts are only the doings of individuals, the most divergent opinions prevail among the Rabbis and preachers; while some as enlightened men of the time tear down, others hold fast to the rotten building, and wish themselves to be buried under it. I myself recently saw a young Rabbi who, whenever he travels, in simple-minded piety, contents himself with prisoner's fare, and whom, when one visits him, one may still find poring over the folios of the Talmud; nay, he is even said to grieve earnestly over the fact that some of the members of his congregation are so far advanced in enlightenment that they do not close their places of business on the Sabbath. What shall become of us, dear Naphtali? I am about to marry, but, God knows, when I think that perhaps I shall be called upon to exercise the duties of a father to children, I tremble. ", "12": "Excuse me, dear friend, that I have spoken so freely and unreservedly, although I know that you revere all this very much, and, I suppose, must do so as Rabbi, on account of your position; still I am confident that you have so much love left for me from former days, that you will, in answering me, forget your office; for what that teaches, I know sufficiently well. ", "13": "Farewell. ", "14": "Your ", "15": "Benjamin.  ", "2": "You listened quietly to my speech, and, when I had done, replied, \"Do you believe that you really understand the object which you are thus condemning? Have you acquired with your own eyes, and by dint of honest, earnest investigation, an actual understanding of a matter which, inasmuch as it is the holiest and most important consideration of our life, should at least not be cast aside thoughtlessly and unreflectingly ? \"You showed me that the only sources of my knowledge were, on the one hand, the mechanical practice of parental customs and a few imperfect and undigested fragments of the Bible and Talmud acquired from Polish teachers, and, on the other hand, Christian writers, modern reformers, and especially that view of life which our present age has brought forth, and which has, as its chief endeavor, the suppression of the inner voice of conscience in favor of the external demands of comfort and ease. ", "3": "I was forced to confess the insufficiency of my knowledge, begged you for instruction; then the coachman called, and, in bidding me good-by, you had only time to call \"in writing.\" You have, therefore, made me distrustful, my dear Naphtali, of the opinions I have hitherto held, but you have not refuted them, nor given me better ones in their stead. I, therefore, take advantage of your kind permission, and repeat to you in writing a number of my charges, not for the purpose of defending my present mode of life, but in the sincere desire of information and guidance. Every religion, I believe, should bring man nearer to his ultimate end. This end, what else can it be than the attainment of happiness and perfection? ", "4": "But if we take these principles as a criterion for Judaism, what utterly depressing results do we not obtain? To what happiness does Judaism conduct its professors? From time immemorial misery and slavery have been their lot; misunderstood or despised by the other nations, and while the rest of mankind mounted to the summit of culture, prosperity, and fortune, its adherents remained always poor in everything which makes human beings great and noble, and which beautifies and dignifies existence. ", "5": "The Law itself interdicts all enjoyments, is a hindrance to all the pleasures of life. For two thousand years we are as the plaything of fate, as a ball tossed from hand to hand, even in the present time driven from all the paths of happiness. And as for the perfecting of human acquirements, what culture, what conquests in the domain of science, art, or invention, in a word, what great achievements have Jews wrought compared with Egyptians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Italians, French, English, or Germans? ", "6": "Robbed of all the characteristics of nationality, we are, nevertheless, deemed a nation, and every one of us is by his very birth doomed to form an additional link in this never-ending chain of misery. The Law is chiefly at fault for all this: by enjoining isolation in life, and thereby arousing suspicion and hostility; by breaking the spirit through the inculcation of humble submissiveness, thereby inviting contempt ; by discouraging the pursuit of the formative arts; by dogmas which bar the way of free speculation, and by removing, through the separation in life, every incentive to exertion in science and art, which, therefore, do not flourish among us. ", "7": "As for our own lore, it perverts the mind and leads it astray into subtleties and the minutia of petty distinctions, until it becomes incapable of entertaining simple and natural opinions, so that I have always wondered not a little how you, who have taste and understanding for the beauties of Virgil, Tasso, and Shakespeare, and who are able to penetrate into the consistent structures of Leibnitz or Kant, can find pleasure in the rude and tasteless writings of the Old Testament, or in the illogical disputations of the Talmud ? ", "8": "And what effect has it, the Law, upon heart and life ? The broad principles of universal morality are narrowed into anxious scrupulosity about insignificant trifles ; nothing is taught except to fear God, everything, even the pettiest details of life, is referred directly to God; life itself becomes a continuous monastic service, nothing but prayers and ceremonies; he the most praiseworthy Jew, who lives most secluded, and knows least of the world, though he permits it to support him, but wastes his life in fasting and praying, and the perusal of senseless writings. Look yourself at the book which is put into our hands as the \"Path of Life,\" and which contains the whole duty of the Jew, what else does it teach except praying and fasting and the keeping of holidays ? Where is there one word of the active, busy life around us? And this, too, just in our time? Why, it is quite impossible to keep these laws intended for an entirely different time. What limitation in travelling, what embarrassment in association with Gentiles, what difficulties in every business ! ", "9": "Please, please do not point, for an answer, to the reformistic tendencies of the age, how little by little everything is being cut away which does not harmonize with the conception of the destiny of man or the needs of the time. Is not this in itself a step outside of Judaism ? "}, "1": {"0": "Because I answer you so soon, dear Benjamin, do not think I have not maturely reflected upon the subjects which you put before me in your letter.", "1": "You know that in my earliest youth these subjects employed my soul, that, reared by en-lightened but God-fearing parents, the voices of T'nach early spoke to my spirit, and that, of my own free will, when my intelligence had already matured, I permitted the T'nach to lead me to Gemara \u2014 that not external necessity caused me to select the vocation of Rabbi, but my own inner life-plan. So much the more do I wonder that you can fear to find in me the hypocrisy of office. I would be angry with you, were you not my friend, were I not yours. But that is the curse of the time and the fatal obstacle to beneficent activity on the part of those in official station, that that which should be the treasured possession of all, has become the attribute of office, so that people are inclined to look upon the universal rule of life as the mere regulation of an order and say, \"Yes, he must be so, must speak so, his position \u2014 his bread \u2014 demands it.\" Sad degradation of the age! It seems quite natural that a man should sell everything, his most cherished individuality, his inmost convictions, for bread, and everything is deemed excusable if it but yield bread, bread! But perhaps you rejoice, Benjamin, and thousands with you, that all of this has been forced to flee for refuge within the limits of an official class, for in this you may see a hope \u2014 and indeed a prospect \u2014 that it will soon be expelled even from there, and the consistent process of erecting life upon the twin foundation principles of happiness and perfection, suspended between heaven and earth, and supported by themselves, may soon begin. ", "2": "Excuse me this excitement, dear friend; I will also try to forget that you spoke so. I proceed, therefore, to answer your letter, and can dispense, I hope, without fear of angering you, with the giving of a special assurance that my official station will not influence my reply. ", "3": "You estimate the value of Judaism by the principle of the purpose of human existence, and this, in your view, is found in happiness and perfection. I could ask: Is it so sure that happiness and perfection form the goal and object of man's being? I could ask upon what basis you found this opinion, or what could you answer to the careless pleasure-seeker or criminal, who thinks the excitement and sensual lust of the moment a greater happiness than all temporal or eternal blessings ? Every one must be permitted to be his own judge of what constitutes happiness for him, for happiness decreed in accordance with any compulsory external standard, ceases to be happiness ! And the perfecting of one's being, the mounting of the highest intellectual heights ! By how few ever attained, by how few attainable ! ", "4": "Truth itself is conceived by a thousand thinkers in a thousand different ways. To neglect its pursuit is, after all, only a sin against oneself, and, therefore, one can only be accountable to oneself. For to whom would I owe an accounting, if this principle only demands the promotion of the happiness and perfection of others as a means of attaining my own, and I relinquish this ? How, I would ask you, is it with the multitude of unhappy and imperfect ones outside of Judaism ? But I will omit all these questions. Let us put aside for a while the standard of measurement, and let us try to know that which we desire to measure \u2014 Judaism, in its history and teachings. Perhaps, on the way, we may learn to think differently concerning the destiny of mankind, and may obtain a different mode of discerning the purpose of the existence of the nations, and their duties. But we must become acquainted with it from the source which it itself points out to us; which it has rescued from the wreck of all its other fortunes as the only original document and source of instruction concerning its true essence\u2014from its To-rah. Its history we must learn from it, for Judaism is an historical phenomenon, and for its origin, its first entrance into history, and for a long subsequent time, the Torah is the only monument. And if, at the cradle of this people, we were to hear mystic voices, such as no other nation ever heard \u2014 voices announcing the purpose of this people's existence \u2014 for which it entered into history, should we not hearken to these voices, and try to comprehend them, that we might thus understand it and its history ? It is the only source of its law, written and oral. Therefore, to the Torah! But, before we open it, let us consider how we shall read it. Not for the purpose of making philological and antiquarian investigations, nor to find support and corroboration for antediluvian or geological hypotheses, nor either in the expectation of unveiling supermundane mysteries, but as Jews must we read it \u2014 that is to say, looking upon it as a book given to us by God that we may learn from it to know ourselves \u2014 what we are, and what we should be in this our earthly existence. It must be to us Torah \u2014 that is, instruction and guidance in this divine world; a generator of spiritual life within us. Our desire is to apprehend Judaism; therefore, we must take up our position in thought within Judaism, and must ask ourselves, \"What will human beings be who recognize the contents of this book as a basis and rule of life given to them by God ?\" In the same way we must seek understanding of the mitzvoth, the commandments \u2014 that is to say, we must strive to know their extent and bearing from the written and oral law. All of this must take place from the standpoint of the object of all this procedure, the finding of the true law of life. Only when you have thus comprehended Judaism from itself, as it represents itself to be, and have then found it untenable and unworthy of acceptance, may you, if you wish, cast upon it the stone of obloquy. We must also read the Torah in Hebrew \u2014 that is to say, in accordance with the spirit of that language. It describes but little, but through the rich significance of its verbal roots it paints in the word a picture of the thing. ", "5": "It only joins for us predicate to subject, and sentence to sentence; but it presupposes the listening soul so watchful and attentive that the deeper sense and profounder meaning, which lie not upon but below the surface, may be supplied by the independent action of the mind itself. It is, as it were, a semi-symbolic writing. With wakeful eye and ear, and with soul roused to activity, we must read; nothing is told us of such superficial import that we need only, as it were, accept it with half roused dreaminess; we must strive ourselves to create again the speaker's thoughts, to think them over, or the sense will escape us. We must follow also the same method in studying the mitzvoth, when they assign a purpose for any particular object, or ordain some symbolic practice. There we must strive to discover analytically the correction of the purpose with this particular object; here the natural method of practically expressing such an idea in consideration of its reason and connection. I only point out to you the path which I have followed. To you I shall give only direct results, and that only, for the present, in general outlines; later, if you wish, you shall learn the details, and also the reasons for the methods of investigation. ", "6": "Now, let us read. May you forget all the annoyance which the reading of these writings caused you in your youth; forget all the prejudices which you may have imbibed from different sources against these writings. Let us read as though we had never read them ; as though we had never heard of them. Let us arouse in our soul the life questions, \"What is the world in me, and around me, to me? What am I; what should I be to it? What am I; what should I be as man-Israel?\"", "7": "With such interrogative spirit let us read, and receive the answer as Jews, from the mouth of the being who alone can give the explanation \u2014 from Deity.

They comprise the instructions derived from the historically-revealed manifestations of Divine truth and which it is our duty to elevate into principles of our life. They teach us to know God in his unity and as summoning us to comprehend our existence in all its many-sidedness and to unite all our powers, abilities, and conditions in subordination to the One. They teach the active service-duty of all beings, including man, who must learn to look upon himself as one of the host of ministering attendants of Deity and willingly join their ranks. His will in this respect is revealed as unchangeable for all ages. Our experience is to serve us as education; the fear of God is to be taught us by the recognition of His illimitable greatness, the love of God by consideration of His unending mercy and kindness, unshakeable trust in Him by appreciation of His eternal faithfulness.

They bid thee put aside pride and desire of sensual pleasure, to respond sympathetically to the sorrow or joy of all beings, and to embrace them all in thy love as children of thy God. These injunctions are but the applications of the principles demonstrated as true in the revelations given in the actions, in the mighty deeds, of God. His commandments are but the expressions of these principles; revealed as concepts, not as mere incomprehensible behests; whosoever desires truth will accept them. ", "2": "Mishpatim. \u2014 Judgments or Principles of Justice. \u2014 All these ideal theories have only value, however, if thou really livest, as thou hast gained the conception, in a Divine world, with Divine powers, man-Israel. The first requisite is, Justice! Respect every being around thee and all that is in thee as the creation of thy God; everything belonging to them as given them by God or in accordance with law which He has sanctioned. Leave willingly to each being that which it is justly entitled to call its own. Be not as regards aught a curse. Especially honor every human being as thy equal, regard him in his essence, that is to say, in his invisible personality, in his bodily envelope and in his life. Extend the same regard to his artificially enlarged body, his property; to the demands which he may be entitled to make upon you for assistance by grants of property or acts of physical strength; in measure and number; in recompense of injury to his person or possessions. Have regard, also, to his rightful claim of truth; of liberty, happiness, and peace of mind, of honor and undisturbed tranquillity. Do not abuse his weakness of heart, mind, or body; do not unjustly employ thy legal power over him. ", "3": "Chukkim. \u2014 Arbitrary or apparently inexplicable Statutes. \u2014 The same thoughtful regard which you show to man, show as well to every lower being; to the earth which bears and sustains all; to the world of animals and plants, to your own body, to your own mental faculties, to your \"ego,\" that which is most of all your own. It is the same justice which you owe to other human beings. What in the case of the Mishpatim results from the concept of identical personality, flows here from the fundamental notion of equal subordination to God, who defends all which is lower in order and subject to you against your caprice and the ebullitions of unregulated will. Your duties towards humanity are more intelligible to you simply because you have only to think of yourself, your own views and feelings, in order to recognize and sympathize with the demands and needs of your fellow-man. Could you put yourself as thoroughly in the place of other beings, could you even understand the conditions of the union and the combined activity of your own body and soul, you would find it as easy to comprehend Chukkim as Mishpatim. They ask of you to regard all beings as God's possessions; destroy none; abuse none; waste nothing; employ all things wisely; the kinds and species of plants and animals are God's order; mingle them not. All creatures are servants in the household of creation. Respect even the feelings and desires of beasts. Respect the body of man even when the personaHty has departed. Respect your own body as receptacle, messenger and instrument of the spirit. Limit and subdue your impulses and animal actions under the law of God that they be used in a manner truly human and holy for the upbuilding of the holy purpose of the human race, that man sink not into a mere beast. Respect your soul in nourishing your body; give the latter only so much and such food as will permit it to be a pure, obedient messenger of the world to the soul, of the soul to the world, but not such as to produce sluggishness or sensuality. Therefore conceal and elevate, do not esteem too highly thy animal part, in order that in the end all contradictory dispositions be eliminated from you, and even the beast-like become truly human.

Never be the instrumentality of curse or misfortune to yourself or your neighbor, but strive, like Deity, to do all your deeds in love, and thus become a blessing to yourself and your surroundings. First become a blessing to yourself in order that you may become it to others. Seek to equip yourself with all the capacities and means which can be of good service to the welfare of your fellow beings; make yourself rich with abundant store of good and noble principles, and then devote yourself to the world for perfect service of blessing. To become the means of blessing, learn first to honor your parents as messengers of God, mankind, and Israel to you; learn also to revere wisdom, age, and virtue, as guides and models, wherever and whenever they appear realized in human character.

Strive also to make the earth a truly human habitation, its creatures truly human possessions, in order that, in addition to your internal resources you may acquire also external wealth as means for carrying out your mission of blessing, and in order to be able independently to establish a house, as a temple in which shall be reared young scions of Adam's race as ideal human beings, ideal Israelites. For such purpose, to grace such a house, take a wife and bring her into your home. Next follows the first task of your blessed mission of love, the first and the highest; to be all in all to helpless human creatures without claim or demand upon you; even to sacrifice your own welfare in order that they shall be able to attain to both earthly well-being and spiritual ideal; that your child may become man-Israel.", "2": "Your mission, however, is not limited by the walls of your house; beyond their limits you must assist with every particle of your strength wherever it is necessary to save the life, the property, or the happiness of a human being, to assist the enterprise of a fellow man with your strength or fortune, or to help suffering creatures of the lower order wherever you can, by the use of your wealth, your physical or intellectual strength, or your word, support the needy, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, console the mourning, heal the sick, care for the unprovided, advise those in need of counsel, teach the ignorant, reconcile those sundered by anger and quarrel \u2014 in a word, to be a blessing whenever and wherever you can.

A truth, in order to produce results, must be impressed upon the mind and heart repeatedly and emphatically. This is the essential concept of the Edoth. The symbols are chiefly those of actions, of practices which serve as signs of an idea. Thus the doctrine that God is the creator and possessor of all; that all is His; man the admintrator according to His will, and Israel the teacher of the law of humanity's mission, is symbolized in the commandments \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e8, the sanctity of the first-born, \u05d7\u05dc\u05d4, the giving of the portion of dough, \u05e2\u05e8\u05dc\u05d4, the prohibition of the use of immature fruit, \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9, the prohibition of the use of the new grain previous to the offering of the measure of barley, \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea, the Sabbath, and in reference to Israel's holy soil through the Sabbatical and Jubilee years, \u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05e9\u05de\u05d8\u05d4, the heave-offering and \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, the offering of the first ripe fruits. ", "1": "The doctrine that God is the Redeemer and Savior of Israel, and also He that revealed His holy law to His chosen nation, is symbolized by \u05e4\u05dd\u05d7, the Passover festival, \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea, the Feast of Weeks, \u05e1\u05db\u05d5\u05ea, the Feast of Tabernacles and \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea, the Eighth day of Solemn Assembly. That God is to us in exile what He was to our ancestors, is symbolized in \u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05db\u05d4, Hanuccah, the Memorial of the Re-dedication of the Temple and in \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, Purim, the Memorial of the deliverance from Haman. Acknowledgment that the spirit vivifies the body and that law is needful as a regulation to freedom is symbolized in the \u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4, the counting of the days between Passover and the Feast of Weeks. Consideration of the causes of the exile and warning to shun the sins which have led thereto are inculcated by the \u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea, fast days. To keep even the body and its organs pure and holy, and to shun all that leads to bestiality is taught by \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4, circumcision. To dedicate all the powers of our mind, heart, and body to the service of the All-One is the lesson of \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05d9\u05df, the Phylacteries. Reminder of the presence of the Invincible One and of His revelation in the past, limitation and repression of sensuality as a weapon for battle against evil, are the purposes of \u05e6\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05ea, the show-threads. Consecration of the Jewish home as a temple of God, of the Jewish life therein as a perpetual service of God, is the aim of \u05de\u05d6\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4, the sacred inscription on the door posts. Recognition of the Jacob-state in Israel, that is, of the lack of external might and independence as a requirement of a truly spiritual conception of the Israel-mission to teach the revelation of God, is symbolized in the \u05de\u05e6\u05d4, bread of afflicton, and \u05d2\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4, prohibition of the sinew of the hip that was lamed.

As concerns the land of Israel, the same lesson is taught by \u05de\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, the tithe-offering. Finally, that highest and most solemn thought known to religion, that God is the supreme Ruler, Judge, and Father; that it is our duty to scrutinize our doings in life in order to know whether they really come up to the high demands of the Holy Law; that it is our duty, when necessary, to recognize and confess our short-comings, which have deprived us of our claim to life, and made us dependent for existence and preservation solely upon the Divine mercy and that it is incumbent upon us to strive to lift ourselves up to a higher plane and a purer future; these sublime and holy truths are taught by \u05e8\u05f4\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05f4\u05db, the New Year and Atonement-day, by \u05e9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d5\u05e8\u05f4\u05d7, by the solemn blast of the ram's-horn, by the rites of the New Month. These symbolic acts and seasons all give expression to ideas, without splitting them up into words as speech must. They come to the mind each a unit, like thought itself, and like the resolve which they should beget; they present themselves with all the force of a single, undivided, and indivisible appeal to the soul. Therefore they are appropriate vehicles to convey the sentiments of a single united nation pervaded with one thought, actuated by one resolve, and are intelligible beyond the confines of Israelitish nationality. Every single detail of action or omission in the Edoth-division of the Law is a writing, a word, a speech addressed to the reverent devotee; they are, all of them, reminders to the soul or vivid expressions of sentiment by means of significant action-language. The greatest and the least of them, even the never-enough-to-be-ridiculed prohibition of the use of an egg laid on Sabbath or holiday, symbolically teach a lesson, and the strict attention paid to so-called trifles is not more worthy of ridicule and not less sensible than your care to use a clear and intelligible language or a legible and neat handwriting. Let us take, for instance, the law of Sabbath, with its prohibition of labor. Many of the minor details of what our Sages technically call \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d4, \"labor,\" we would hardly recognize as such, and yet not even the pettiest and most insignificant thereof but has its reason and definite purpose. ", "3": "The day upon which the newly-created world first lay extended in its completeness before man that he might possess and rule over it, this day was to be to him an eternal monument of the great truth that all around him was the possession of God, the Creator, and that God it was who had conferred upon him the power and the right to rule it, in order that he should not grow overweening in his dominion and should administer his trust as the property of God and in accordance with His supreme will. In order to retain this idea ever fresh and vivid, he should refrain on this day from exercising his human sway over the things of earth, should not place his hand upon any object for the purpose of human dominion, that is, to employ it for any human end; he must, as it were, return the borrowed world to its Divine Owner in order to realize that it is but lent to him. On this account the labor forbidden on the Sabbath is chiefly \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05ea \u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea, that is to say, productive activity, executed consciously, with purpose and proper means, in order to produce a certain result, an action, therefore, which is the outcome of human will and conscious force, not, however, \u05e7\u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc, \"an action which produces no desired result,\" \u05de\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05e7, \"purposeless occupation,\" \u05e9\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05ea\u05db\u05d5\u05df, \"unintentional work,\" \u05e9\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d2\u05d5\u05e4\u05d4 \"in itself unnecessary,\" \u05db\u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d3, \"indirectly performed,\" or not in \u05e9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8, \"proper measure and proportion.\" Do you not see that every moment of the Sabbath that you restrain your hand from labor you proclaim God the only Creator and Master and yourself as his servant? Do you not see that even the slightest, least arduous, productive action on the Sabbath involves the denial of God as Creator and Lord, and the usurpation on your part of the throne of God? The desecration of the Sabbath is therefore equivalent to the entire rejection and negation of the Israel-mission. Do you not recognize that the Sabbath is not a mere day of physical recuperation, but that it is \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea, \"a covenant,\" \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05df, \"a sacred memorial,\" \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea, \" a profoundly instructive sign?\" It is \u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9, a sacred day which is not instituted solely that man may rest after the labors of the week which is past, but may consecrate himself to the tasks of the week which is to come. ", "4": "The Sabbath is thus an institution of vast significance, but not it alone, every one of the many ordinances which constitute the Edoth is similarly laden with great and invaluable instruction, and both those ordinances deducible from the plain word of Scripture, \u05d3\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d0, and those established by Rabbinical interpretation, \u05d3\u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05df, are equally instructive and important."}, "13": {"0": "The last division of the Holy Law, Abodah (service or worship), remains for our consideration. ", "1": "Abodah, the service of God; it means to turn away from the ambitions, the occupations, and the sins which mainly constitute our material existence, and to strive to regain the eternal verities of the higher life when they have gone astray from us in the deceptions, errors, conflicts, and temptations of the world. \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05dc\u05d1, heart service, our Sages love to call true devotion; that is, to fulfill the will of God towards our inner parts by purifying and ennobling our unseen power, our character. ", "2": "\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4, prayer, is our chief form of serving the Supreme One in the present age, but the Hebrew conception of prayer is not the mere request or petition for Divine aid, nor even a mere ecstasy of devotion and adoration; it means the possession and expression of proper conceptions and resolutions concerning our own personality and our duties toward God, the world, and mankind. In former days the sacrificial rite was the expression of our service of God; its ordinances and ceremonies were symbolic actions of profound significance. The Temple, the dwelling of the Torah, itself Israel's most sacred possession, taught the lesson that the Law was God's gift to Israel (\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df), and that for its fulfillment God had given unto man the power of body and mind. (\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05df and \u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4.) The sacrifices, each inculcates its individual meaning, the suppression of sensuality, of selfishness, the consecration of life, of the sentiments, of one's entire personality, to God for the fulfillment of his Law. Some of them typify the endeavor to consecrate oneself to God through the Torah, others the effort to regain lost purity of life by the suppression of sensuality and selfishness, equivalent to return to the Law; others, again, the recognition of God as the Giver of the great good things of life or the Preserver of our peace and happiness. This recognition of the Divine benevolence must be complete, sincere, and free from every material and sensual thought. Our gratitude must be extended to Him because He has given us so much which we can consecrate to the fulfillment of His holy will as revealed in the Torah. These symbolic actions were all accompanied by the living word of fervent devotion. (See Maimonides \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd, Chap, vi.) The temple is sunk into ruins, but the living word of worship and instruction remains, completer even than in former times, because the symbolic rites of sacrifices must be represented also by it. The aim of our worship, \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4 from \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05dc, is the purification, enlightenment, and uplifting of our inner selves to the recognition of the Most High and our duties towards Him in truth; not mere stirring up of the emotions, swiftly- vanishing devotion, empty sentimentalism, and unreasoning tears, but the cleansing of thought and heart. ", "3": "Life robs us of the correct judgment concerning God, the world, man, and Israel, and concerning our own relation to them. Leaving the disturbing influences of life and turning to God, you can approach and find Him in the mystic contemplations of the Tefillah. All the various component parts of the Hebrew worship subserve this great purpose, the bringing of man into communication with Him who is concealed from view in his (man's) daily life, \u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea, the psalms or praises; they show us ecstatic visions of God in nature, the world of man and in Israel. \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea, the prayers or devotions; they stir up our nature to its deepest depths and lift us up to communion with the Divine. \u05ea\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea, thanks-givings and \u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea, supplications ; they express our profound gratitude for all that Deity has wrought and our full and unrestricted acknowledgment that everything past or future proceeds from His hands, and our humble petition that He may continue His bounty unto US, though we be unworthy. \u05ea\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea, humble appeals to His unfailing mercy to heal our weaknesses and backslidings. The scientific foundation and basis upon which all this edifice of worship is raised is the \u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, \"reading of the Law,\" which imparts unto us the instruction and wisdom which we require; its utmost summit and goal, the perfect fruit of our piety, are the \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea, benedictions, which supply us the firm resolution actively to promote the fulfillment of the Divine will in the midst of life, so busy with transitory cares and devoted pre-eminently to material aims. Retain these sketchy outlines in your mind, and bearing them in memory contemplate afresh our prayers, our service as a whole, and see if you do not find it more dignified, fuller of meaning and importance than you had ever before imagined.

", "5": "And now, my dear Benjamin, a law which bids us recognize God in the world and in mankind, which teaches that the fulfillment of His will is our mission, which shows us in Him the Father of all beings, of all men and in every creature, every human being our brother; a law which makes our whole life service of God through the practice of righteousness and love toward all beings and the proclaiming of these truths for ourselves and others; can this be a law which stunts the mind and the heart, limits every joy of life and turns men into secluded monks? Can it be that the study of this law, when pursued earnestly and intelligently, perverts and deadens the mind, narrows or restricts the impulses of the heart? ", "6": "Its true description is found in the words of  the sweet singer of Israel:  \"The heavens declare themselves  Revelation of God's glory;  The thin sheet of space (declares)  That it is His handiwork.  Day proclaims to day  That God has spoken;  Night after night revives  The thoughts of Deity.  No speech we need,  No words are spoken,  Without them the voice is heard.  Through all the earth their voice goes forth,  To the end of the earth-world their words.  In them He hath set the tent of the sun.  Which it leaves as a bridegroom his canopy;  It rejoices, as the Almighty, to run its course.  And yet fixed in heaven is its issue,  Its circuit reaches ever the same end.  None are hidden from his sun.  But only the law of God is complete,  Giving answer to th' inquiring soul;  The testimony of God alone is faithful,  Giving wisdom to th' unlearned;  Th' ordinances of God are righteous,  Giving joy to the heart;  The commands of God are clear,  Giving light to the eyes;  The fear of God is pure.  Existing forever;  The judgments of God are true,  They are right altogether,  Better than gold and much ore,  Sweeter than honey and dripping comb.  O, that Thy servant might be illumed by them!

", "1": "These words are to me proof and guarantee that I have not written in vain. ", "10": "Has this people furnished no contribution to the great edifice of human civilization? I shall not ask whether any of the other peoples ever consciously did anything with a view to the furtherance of universal human happiness. I shall not ask whether they did not all seek only their own welfare, nor whether they ever performed any deed of general value except unconsciously, as blind instruments in the hand of God; neither shall I inquire whether all was indeed productive of blessing, but I shall, indeed, challenge the world to deny that Israel, consciously, and at the sacrifice of its earthly peace and well-being, saved as a palladium from the shipwreck of its fortunes the only thing through which science, culture, art, and inventive skill could become the means of bringing true blessing and salvation to the world. Is there any truer greatness for men than to be the bearers of revealed instruction concerning God and the duty of man, and to show by example and life that there are higher things than wealth and pleasure, than science and culture, to which these should be but subordinate means of fulfillment? ", "11": "Does not this law erect a wall of separation between its adherents and the rest of mankind? It does, I admit, but had it not done so Israel would long since have lost all consciousness of its mission, would long since have ceased to be itself. Do you not perceive what struggles the preservation of the true Israel-spirit in our midst requires, despite this separation? How, then, could the holy flame have been kept burning in our breasts had there been no distinctive laws and ordinances to remind us that we are consecrated to a sacred duty, a Divine mission? But whosoever honestly thinks that our isolation is the result of pride or of hostility to our fellow beings is the victim of a deplorable delusion. Is not God the loving Father of all creatures, of all human beings ? ", "12": "Has Israel any other task than to teach all the races of man to recognize and worship the Only-One as their God? Is it not Israel's unceasing duty to proclaim through the example of its life and history Him as the Universal Lord and Sovereign? The Bible terms Israel \u05e1\u05d2\u05dc\u05d4, \"a peculiar treasure,\" but this designation does not imply, as some have falsely interpreted, that Israel has a monopoly of the Divine love and favor, but, on the contrary, that God has the sole and exclusive claim to Israel's devotions and service; that Israel may not render Divine homage to any other being. Israel's most cherished ideal is that of universal brotherhood of mankind. Almost every page of the prayers we utter contains supplication for the hastening of this consummation. We are all helping to rear a great edifice, Divinely ordained for the well-being of man; all nations that were or are anywhere upon the surface of the earth, whether in the east or the west, the north or the south, each with its life and its disappearance from the stage of history, with its successes and its failures, with its virtues and its vices, its wisdom and its folly, its rise and its fall, in a word, with whatsoever it leaves to posterity as the sum total of the results and products of its existence.

", "15": "Is not the spirit prostrated and degraded by the absolute devotion which this law requires, so that the observant Jew loses the courage and the strength which free contact with the world and participation in its affairs give? The question is \"Whom do you respect more, who is really the stronger, the downtrodden Jew, who possesses in the dust of humility sufficient strength of mind and character to pity his opponent and to accept the scorn heaped upon him as a trial sent by God and as a part of the destiny of his nation, or the ruffian, who, in his overweening pride, abuses the weakness of his fellow man, seems to consider himself privileged to revile the feeble and impotent and to find therein his claim to greatness?\" ", "16": "Do not say that this conception of God, the world, and humanity clogs the progress of science, and as for art, the plastic arts, why, since men began to forget the All-One and to deify His creatures, even to worship their own animal impulses, whose omnipotence they felt, and to glorify them in symbols of stone, so that every god statue became a sad memento of human degradation; since then, truly, Judaism interdicts the making and possession of such images, for to it truth is higher and greater than art. Certainly, no artist inspired with the true spirit of Judaism would take the chisel, the brush, or the pencil in his hand to form an art-work adapted only to stir up impure imaginations and to rouse the animal in man; for, if such productions of art be deemed useful and proper, then are morality and virtue mere empty words and not, as we conceive them to be, in reality the standard and the measure of our actions. ", "17": "You speak of dogmas, dogmas of faith! In answer thereto, I would briefly say that Judaism enjoins six hundred and thirteen duties, but knows no dogmas. The sublime truths which lie at its basis, it reveals as axioms, clearly intelligible to all who have ears to hear and minds to comprehend, and in this way opens a field for the broadest investigation and profoundest research into the essence and relations of all things to each other; it rouses us to the endeavor to understand the world, man, human history, and God's plan operating therein. In this effort personal study and thought, universal human experience and the Torah are to be alike utilized, for the latter is as real and actual a source of instruction as the two former. True speculation does not consist, as many would-be thinkers suppose, in closing the eye and the ear to the world round about us and in constructing out of our own inner Ego a world to suit ourselves; true speculation takes nature, man, and history as facts, as the true basis of knowledge, and seeks in them instruction and wisdom; to these Judaism adds the Torah, as genuine a reality as heaven or earth. But it regards no speculation which does not lead to active, productive life as its ultimate goal; it points out the limits of our understanding and warns us against baseless reasoning, transcending the legitimate bounds of our intellectual capacity, however brilliantly put together and glitteringly logical it may appear to be, for all such intellectual pyrotechnics are, after all, but puerile sport, useful chiefly to still the conscientious scruples of a sensual nature, oblivious alike to the limitations and the ideals of humanity. To be sure, the Jewish spirit, in its most recent form, was chiefly devoted to abstract and abstruse speculation; a vivid consciousness of the real world was lacking, and therefore the object of study was not what it should chiefly have been, the attainment of knowledge of duty, for use in the world and in life. Study became the end instead of the means, the subject of investigation became a matter of indifference, the dialectic subtleties thereof the chief concern; people studied Judaism but forgot to search for its principles in the pages of Scripture. That method is, however, not truly Jewish; our great masters have always protested against it; many pages of the classic works of Jewish literature are filled with the objections of their authors to this false and perverted method. Bible and Talmud are to be studied with one sole object in view, to ascertain the life-duties which they inculcate, \u05dc\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d5\u05dc\u05dc\u05de\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea, \"to learn and to teach \u2014 to observe and to do,\" and every topic treated of in the Law should be viewed objectively or a comprehension thereof obtained from science. There is no science which trains the mind to a broader and more practical view of things than does the Torah, pursued in this manner. That the Law, which lays down Reverence, Love, and Faithfulness as its three foundation-stones, does not cripple the heart, but that, when comprehended and assimilated to the mind, its fulfillment becomes a new power, a life from within, not a mere barren and external dwarf of existence, stimulating all the faculties to a freer development and a more intense use \u2014 you have already demonstrated by your adhesion. ", "18": "\"Chasid,\" pious one! a glorious name, but misunderstood and deformed through ignorant or malicious misconception coming from without; the true \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3 is he who devotes himself in love entirely to the service of the Higher Power, who does not seek for himself aught, but relinquishes his claims upon the world in order that he may live more actively and carry out more thoroughly works of love for the world; he does not withdraw from its midst, but lives in it, with it, and for it. The Chasid is for himself, nothing; for the world, everything. David, therefore, who labored from his earliest youth continuously and exclusively for the internal and external well-being of his people, and who left the reparation of the injury done him by Saul and the disposal of his own affairs to the wisdom of Deity alone; he, indeed, deserves to be called \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3. You know the Rabbinical definition of the term \"\u05e9\u05dc\u05da \u05e9\u05dc\u05da \u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc\u05da \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3.\" He who says, \"That which is thine is thine and mine is also thine, is a Chasid,\" but a life of seclusion devoted only to meditation and prayer is not Judaism.

If our view of life is earnest and serious; if we comprehend Judaism as the charge with which we are entrusted, and which we are to bear through time and tribulation; if we realize that it is our life-code of duty, can the difficulty, the burdensomeness of an obligation dispense us from its fulfillment?

Yes, if you would but contemplate your life in the spirit of the Sabbath, if you would for but one single moment comprehend yourself as viewed by the eternal gaze of God, as the Sabbath teaches that you are; if you would comprehend yourself as vivified of God, in a God-filled world, the totality of its life directed by God; if you would feel yourself child and servant of the All-One; all your existence dependent upon the will of the All-Only Father and Lord, every breath His gift, every faculty His offering, every event in your history His doing; you, His servant, your whole life fulfillment of His commandments ; \u2014 would you then still comprehend your present complaint? You would then comprehend that your longing to possess is but one of your duties, and essentially the same as any of the others, and esteem your possessions, not according to the amount of the property you have acquired, but according to the degree of compliance with the Divine commandments you have observed in accumulating it, as well as in using and applying it; you would understand that though the six days bring you the external means of fulfilling your mission, the seventh alone can afford you the inner means, spiritual power and consecration, and that these blessed results can only be attained if both gain and disposal be in accordance with the Divine precept; you would see that since God it is who has given you power to earn and blessing in the accumulation, He is also rich and strong enough to shower upon your dwelling so much manna in six days that on the seventh you would not lack, then you would feel that you do not, because of that complaint, cease to be a Jew, but that you must have ceased to be a Jew, in the only true and real sense, before you could utter such a complaint. \"But how about intercourse with non-Jews?

You cannot be angry with the Law, if it interdicts for you marriage alliance outside of Israel, because you should rear your children, the most precious pledges of the Divine love, only for His Torah, and it would mean to lead them away from the Torah, if you would not be to them an Israelitish father, or would give them other than an Israelitish mother.

The essential notion of this system is either that of the world without an active God or of God without a world that serves Him. Judaism takes another and a higher view, and predicates even the highest and best as means only to that higher end. Doubtless you now comprehend our national misfortunes as the product of our national shortcomings, shortcomings which do not, by any means, however, lower us in point of righteousness below the standard of the other nations. Israel never committed a sin which the other nations of the world did not also commit. But the standard applied to Israel was a higher one; what Deity readily pardons to others He would not forgive to us; the destruction of the Israel-state, which had fallen short of its high ideals, was the direct consequence of these universal sins; it was a part of the Divine administration of Israel's career. ", "4": "\"And God punished in him the sin of us all.\" ", "5": "Israel's material weakness and deprivation of worldly joys and glory seem to you now a part of the scheme of its God-revealing existence; you realize that the external humility of the nation's lot did not disturb its mission nor diminish its greatness. It simply exchanged one kind of greatness for another, and in dispersion there was opened to it a new and broader field for the fulfillment of its mission. ", "6": "And as for the Law, is it really a preventative of all the joys of life, a hindrance and an obstacle to the gratification of the natural human craving for pleasure? Examine once the precepts and ordinances of the Law from beginning to end and tell me what legitimate desire it forbids to gratify, what natural impulse it would destroy or extirpate. ", "7": "On the contrary, it purifies and sanctifies even our lower impulses and desires by applying them with wise limitation to the purposes designated by the Creator. ", "8": "Righteousness is the Law's typical end and aim, the gratification of physical lust and passion is never its object. Therefore are the lower cravings subordinated to higher law and limited by the Creator's wisdom for His infinitely wise purposes; but as means of attaining proper and necessary ends, the Law recognizes these desires as perfectly moral, pure, and human, and their carrying out as just and as legitimate as the fulfillment of any other human task or mission. ", "9": "What the Law, however, firmly and unyieldingly opposes is the deification of wealth and lust as the sole aim and controlling impulse of our lives; but it not only permits their pursuit within the limits set by Divine wisdom, but declares the effort to gain them a duty as sacred and binding as any other human obligation, and condemns the purposeless and unreasonable abstinence from permitted indulgences as sin. How could the reverse of this be possible? Is it conceivable that God would bestow upon man any power or capacity and then, by utter prohibition of its use, legally annihilate it? Highest and truest worship is it to be \"joyous before the Lord;\" to pass one's life in gladsome lightness of spirit because of the consciousness that we live under the eye of God and that His protecting hand is ever outstretched to guide and guard us in every danger and trial; to think and feel, to speak and work, to enjoy and to endure. Then, through a higher comprehension of them both, shall we be reconciled to suffering and happiness alike, realizing that all our varied experiences belong to our task, and that our only eternal purpose in life is joyously to solve its problems. "}, "15": {"0": "You ask me for my opinion on the question which at present agitates so greatly the minds of men, emancipation; whether I consider it feasible and desirable, according to the spirit of Judaism, our duty to strive to attain it. The new conception of Judaism which you have gained, dear Benjamin, has rendered you uncertain as to the reconcilability of Gentile citizenship with the eternal ideals of our faith. You have begun to doubt whether the acceptance of these new relations be in harmony with the spirit of Judaism, inasmuch as it approximates to a close union with that which is different and alien, and a severance of the ties which bind us to the Israel lot; you doubt its desirability, because through over much intimacy with the Gentile, Israel's peculiar characteristics could easily be obliterated. I respect your scruples, and will communicate to you my own opinion. Let us first examine whether it be in harmony with the spirit of Judaism. ", "1": "When Israel began its great wandering through the ages and nations, Jeremiah proclaimed the following as its duty: ", "10": "When Galuth will be comprehended and accepted as it should be, when in suffering, the service of God and His Torah will be understood as the only task of life, when even in misery God will be served, and external abundance esteemed only as a means of this service, then, perhaps, Israel will be ready for the greater temptations of prosperity and happiness in dispersion. Just as it is our duty to endeavor to obtain those material possessions which are the fundamental condition of life, so also is it the duty of every one to take advantage of every alleviation and improvement of his condition open to him in a righteous way; for, the more means, the more opportunity is given to him to fulfill his mission in its broadest sense; and no less than of the individual is it the duty of the community to obtain for all its members the opportunities and privileges of citizenship and liberty. Do I consider it desirable ? I bless emancipation, when I see how the excess of oppression drove Israel away from human intercourse, prevented the cultivation of the mind, limited the free development of the noble sides of character, and compelled many individuals to enter, for the sake of self-support, upon paths which, to be sure men filled with the true spirit of Judaism would have shunned even in the extremest necessity, but the temptation to enter upon which they were too weak to withstand. ", "11": "I bless emancipation when I notice that no spiritual principle, even such as are born of superstitious self-deception, stands in its way, but only those passions degrading to humanity, lust for gain and narrow selfishness; I rejoice when I perceive that in this concession of emancipation, regard for the inborn rights of men to live as equals among equals, and the principle that whosoever bears the seal of a child of God, unto whom belongs the earth, shall be willingly acknowledged by all as brother, are freely acknowledged without force or compulsion, but purely through the power of their inner truth and demand, as a natural consequence, the sacrifice of the base passions, love of self and gain. I welcome this sacrifice, wherever it is offered, as the dawn of reviving humanity in mankind, as a preliminary step to the universal recognition of God as the only Lord and Father, of all human beings as the children of the All-One, and consequently brethren, and of the earth as soil common to all, and bestowed upon them by God to be administered in accordance with His will. But for Israel I only bless it if at the same time there awakes in Israel the true spirit, which, independent of emancipation or non-emancipation, strives to fulfill the Israel-mission; to elevate and ennoble ourselves, to implant the spirit of Judaism in our souls, in order that it may produce a life in which that spirit shall be reflected and realized. I bless it, if Israel does not regard emancipation as the goal of its task, but only as a new condition of its mission, and as a new trial, much severer than the trial of oppression ; but I should grieve if Israel understood itself so little, and had so little comprehension of its own spirit that it would welcome emancipation as the end of the Galuth, and the highest goal of its historic mission. If Israel regards this glorious concession merely as a means of securing a greater degree of comfort in life, and greater opportunities for the acquisition of wealth and enjoyments, it would show that Israel had not comprehended the spirit of its own Law, nor learnt aught from the Galuth. But sorrowfully, indeed, would I mourn, if Israel should so far forget itself as to deem emancipation \u2014 increased room for the acquisition of gain and pleasure through freedom from unjust oppression \u2014 not too dearly purchased through capricious curtailment of the Torah, capricious abandonment of the chief element of our vitality. We must become Jews, Jews in the true sense of the word, permitting the spirit of the Law to pervade our entire being, accepting it as the fountain of life spiritual and ethical; then will Judaism gladly welcome emancipation as affording a greater opportunity for the fulfillment of its task, the realization of a noble and ideal life.  ", "2": "\"Build houses and dwell therein; plant gardens and eat the fruit thereof; take wives unto yourselves, and beget sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage that they bear sons and daughters, and that you multiply there and diminish not. And seek the peace of the city whither I have exiled you, and pray for it to the Lord, for in its peace there will be unto you peace.\" ", "3": "To be pushed back and limited upon the path of life is, therefore, not an essential condition of the Galuth, Israel's exile state among the nations, but, on the contrary, it is our duty to join ourselves as closely as possible to the state which receives us into its midst, to promote its welfare and not to consider our well-being as in any way separate from that of the state to which we belong. ", "4": "This close connection with all states is in nowise in contradiction to the spirit of Judaism, for the former independent state life of Israel was not even then the essence or purpose of our national existence, was only a means of fulfilling our spiritual mission. ", "5": "Land and soil were never Israel's bond of union, but only the common task of the Torah; therefore, it still forms a united body, though separated from a national soil; nor does this unity lose its reality, though Israel accept everywhere the citizenship of the nations amongst which it is dispersed. This coherence of sympathy, this spiritual union, which may be designated by the Hebrew terms \u05e2\u05dd and \u05d2\u05d5\u05d9, but not by the expression \"nation,\" unless we are able to separate from the term the concept of common territory and political power, is the only communal band we possess, or ever expect to possess, until the great day shall arrive when the Almighty shall see fit, in His inscrutable wisdom, to unite again His scattered servants in one land, and the Torah shall be the guiding principle of a state, an exemplar of the meaning of Divine Revelation and the mission of humanity. ", "6": "For this future, which is promised us in the glorious predictions of the inspired prophets, whom God raised up for our ancestors, we hope and pray; but actively to accelerate its coming were sin, and is prohibited to us, while the entire purpose of the Messianic age is that we may, in prosperity, exhibit to mankind a better example of \"Israel\" than did our ancestors the first time, while, hand in hand with us, the entire race will be joined in universal brotherhood through the recognition of God, the All-One. ", "7": "On account of this purely spiritual nature of the national character of Israel it is capable of the most intimate union with states, with, perhaps, this difference, that while others seek in the state only the material benefits which it secures, considering possession and enjoyment as the highest good, Israel can only regard it as a means of fulfilling the mission of humanity. ", "8": "Summon up, I pray you, before your mental vision, the picture of such an Israel, dwelling in freedom in the midst of the nations, and striving to attain unto its ideal, every son of Israel a respected and influential exemplar priest of righteousness and love, disseminating among the nations not specific Judaism, for proselytism is interdicted, but pure humanity. What a mighty impulse to progress, what a luminary and staff in the gloomy days of the Middle Ages had not Israel's sin and the insanity of the nations rendered such a Galuth impossible! How impressive, how sublime it would have been, if, in the midst of a race that adored only power, possessions, and enjoyment, and that was oft blinded by superstitious imaginings, there had lived quietly and publicly human beings of a different sort, who beheld in material possessions only the means of practising justice and love towards all; whose minds, pervaded with the wisdom and truth of the law, maintained simple, straightforward views, and emphasized them for themselves and others in expressive, vivid deed-symbols. ", "9": "But it would seem as though Israel was to be fitted through the endurance of harsh and cruel exile for the proper appreciation and utilization of its milder and gentler form. "}, "16": {"0": "You are right. The whole question of emancipation, which only concerns our external state, possesses but a subordinate interest for Judaism. Sooner or later the nations will decide what attitude they should take in the issue between right and wrong, between humanity or inhumanity, and the first awakening of a nobler sentiment than the mere lust for possession and enjoyment, the first expression of a livelier appreciation of the universal Lordship and Fatherhood of God, and of the earth as a Holy Land, given by Him to all men for the fulfillment of mankind's task, will speedily take effect in the emancipation of all the oppressed, and, therefore, also in that of the Jews. ", "1": "Emancipation, like our external state altogether, is a matter, religiously speaking, of secondary consideration. We may, indeed, take part in accelerating its coming, but in itself it makes us neither greater nor smaller. ", "2": "There is another goal before us, whose attainment depends entirely upon our own efforts; it is the refinement and ennoblement of ourselves, the fulfillment of Judaism by Jews. ", "3": "This leads to a consideration of the topic which you designate by the term \"Reform.\"", "4": "Certainly, dear Benjamin, we are far from being what we should be, and if you compare the life ideal, which the Torah desires us to realize, even according to the scanty outlines which I have drawn for you in these letters, with our actual life as individuals and as a community, you will at once discern how numerous are the steps which we must still make, and how great the distance yet to be climbed before we can reach the glorious summit of our aspiration and our hope. Therefore, may our motto be \u2014 Reform; let us strive with all our power, with all the good and noble qualities of our character to reach this height of ideal perfection \u2014 Reform. ", "5": "Its only object, however, must be the fulfillment of Judaism by Jews in our time, fulfillment of the eternal idea in harmony with the conditions of the time; education, progress to the Torah height, not, however, lowering the Torah to the level of the age, cutting down the towering summit to the sunken grade of our life. We Jews need to be reformed through Judaism, newly comprehended by the spirit and fulfilled with the utmost energy; but merely to seek greater ease and comfort in life through the destruction of the eternal code set up for all ages by the God of Eternity, is not and never can be Reform. Judaism seeks to lift us up to its height, how dare we attempt to drag it down to our level ? ", "6": "Undoubtedly you recognize the evil defect of our time; ignorance or false views of Judaism, combined with a tendency, penetrating from the outer world into our humble habitations, to look upon enjoyment as the chief aim of life. ", "7": "Alas! how widespread is ignorance, how rare the Jew who knows himself, his purpose in life, and the meaning of his history! Where are the sons of Israel in whose breast echo the tones of the harp of David and the words of the prophets, and whose mind \u2014 but, ah! I should be silent concerning the mind \u2014 comprehends the extent of the Israel-duty? And what wrong and mischievous notions exist concerning the principles, ordinances, and teachings of Judaism? Even that which is known externally and superficially, how little is it known as regards its wondrously profound inner meaning! For instance, the Edoth duties, so useful and indispensable through the lessons they teach, are looked upon by some as mere mechanical opus operatum, or as talismanic jugglery for the prevention of physical evils or the erection of mystic supramundane worlds. Others again look upon the holiest laws of righteousness as matters outside of Judaism, not, as they should regard them, indissolubly interwoven with its very fabric. ", "8": "As for those highly important laws of Judaism, which strengthen us to do battle with the sensual lusts of appetite and passion, of indulgence and ease, how little are they understood, how often denounced as cruel privation .beyond the power of human nature to endure; how can they otherwise than succumb in this unequal combat, since their victory is gained by the spirit, and that is either absent or wofully deficient? This inner conception is lacking, comprehension of Judaism, of the significance of its historic mission and teachings, and, therefore, love for it has no soil upon which to grow. How extreme the resultant danger is can be conceived when we consider that this love is our only counterbalance against internal and external temptation, and the attainment of this love our aim and our only salvation. Compare with this view the tendencies of contemporary Reform. Be wroth with none, respect all, for they all feel the shortcomings which exist, all wish that which is good, as they conceive it; all desire sincerely the welfare of Israel, and if they have failed to recognize the good and have erred in their comprehension of the truth, not they are chiefly to blame; the entire past bears the responsibility together with them. You should, therefore, respect their intentions, but you may well mourn and weep when you examine the aims to which their efforts are directed. Is that the Reform we need, to take a standpoint outside of Judaism, to accept a conception derived from strangers, of the purposes of human life, and the object of liberty, and then, in correspondence with this borrowed notion, to cut, curtail, and obliterate the tenets and ordinances of Judaism? Is that the Reform we desire, to remain within Judaism, uncomprehended Judaism, and to confine one's effort to modifying the external form of an uncomprehended part of Judaism, the service, in accordance with the demands of an age, abounding in hollow sentimentality, but sadly deficient in sound reflection and thought, substituting for things misunderstood and abolished other things equally uncomprehended; nothing instituted or originated to emphasize or perpetuate any true inner sentiment of our faith? And as for the religious education of the young, which should be the bearer of all our hopes for the future, how is it situated? ", "9": "Education, indeed, is not lacking; our youth are made thoroughly capable of contending vigorously in the struggle for bread ; handiwork, commerce, art, science \u2014 all these are carefully inculcated and the mind developed, although even in this regard more attention is paid to the mere strengthening of the memory than to the cultivation of habits of thought; but the culture of the heart, the inculcation of Judaism, its emphatic presentation by the school resulting in its consequent infiltration through life, the rearing of human beings who will comprehend themselves as beings living in a Divine world and endowed with Divine powers, which they shall dedicate to the fulfillment of the Divine will; human beings who shall rejoice in their mission and be filled with fiery love for the name \"Jew,\" which summons them to such a life, to fulfill the Divine law amidst perils, sufferings, and privations; human beings who comprehend the world, the past and the present and themselves as corner-stones in the edifice of the future \u2014 if we seek such, we find a vacuum. Take one of the religious books in your hand and what will you find, a life-principle drawn from outside of Judaism, the thirteen creeds upon which Judaism perhaps stands, but of which it is not composed, and a few moral principles deduced from the Ten Commandments, the Chukkim and Edoth not mentioned, or but slightly, as the so-called ceremonial law in the appendix. It is all more or less the reflection of catechisms, originated upon a different domain, for totally different purposes. Among those, again, who do not use these catechisms we find taught the merest word-knowledge of the Torah, sometimes not even that ; and as for the duties, they are merely taught for practice, in the most superficial manner, but without the slightest elucidation or spiritual fervor, to insure their comprehension and retention in life. Whence, in Heaven's name, shall Jews come, Jews inspired with the living spirit of the knowledge of God and their mission, and girded with strength to do battle against sensuality and error, against the troubles and sorrows of time? You see \u2014 but why continue the gloomy picture? Let us rejoice that at least Israel's youth is not inferior to others in intellect and morality, even though far removed from the ideals of Judaism. Let us rejoice at the activity within Judaism, even though much of it is but destruction or the painting over of rotten parts. This is the pledge of a better time. Let us try to outline the methods for obtaining a desirable reconstruction and a reform which appears to us true. "}, "17": {"0": "The very essence of Israel's being rests upon the Torah; in it is our basis and our goal, from it the vital fluid in our veins. If our relation to it, the law of life and truth, be healthy and normal, Israel can suffer no ill; if sick, Israel cannot be well. There is no evil, no wrongful development in Judaism which does not owe its origin to an improper or sinful comprehension of the Torah, or at least is perpetuated thereby. Our sages with profound insight point to this as the true cause of the first national downfall, \u05e9\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4, that they did not study the Law with the firm resolve to fulfill it in life and for life; life, the practical daily life of the world, fled from the Law, and the Law could not therefore properly pervade life, could not adequately enlighten it and inspire it with its, the Law's, own genial warmth. ", "1": "If you search for the cause of our modern sickness, you will find it nowhere else than in this fatal misconception and misapprehension. Originally only the fundamental teachings of Israel's Law were fixed in written form, the so-called written Law, \u05ea\u05f4\u05e9\u05f4\u05d1\u05f4\u05db, but the broader application thereof, in particular the spirit, which is the life, was to be preserved only in the living word, the so-called oral law, \u05ea\u05f4\u05e9\u05f4\u05d1\u05f4\u05e4. The oppressions and afflictions of the times and the dispersion of Israel threatened destruction to the traditional science; the great and holy men who stood at the nation's head, yielding to necessity, decreed that the Mishnah be written down as far as its mere external word was conceived, but its spirit was still left to the traditional exposition of the living word. Increased external sorrows demanded more; they put into writing the spirit of the Mishnah in the Gemara, but the spirit of the Gemara was still reserved for oral interpretation. The affliction increased, making further safeguards necessary; they put the spirit of Bible and Gemara into the Aggadoth or allegorical interpretations, but disguised and veiled so that personal research should still be required to discover the true spirit of the traditional teachings thus perpetuated. ", "10": "Does not the Moreh itself say that in forming the concept of the Mitzvoth it uses the written Law only as the basis, a standpoint which Maimonides himself would have declared incorrect for the practical fulfillment, and which cannot, therefore, be considered aught else than irrational? ", "11": "Does he not himself say that in considering the significance of the Mitzvoth he has overlooked those details which, in their totality, give the complete idea of the Mitzvoth, and which form the main subjects of discussion in the Oral Law? (Moreh Nebuchim, Chapters XXVI and XLI.) There must be sense in all the commandments, in particular as regards those which announce themselves as instructive, which call themselves Testimony, Memorial, Symbol. It must be possible to find the indwelling spirit of these; how would it be to try to do so, to make once the experiment? This attempt has hitherto never been made. Many did not wish to make the attempt nor to attain to the result. A spirit had come from the West, which mocked at everything holy, and knew no greater pleasure than to make them ridiculous, and together with it there entered a longing for sensual enjoyments, which eagerly embraced the opportunity to rid itself so easily of burdensome restrictions. These motives combined to induce people to tear down the barriers erected by the Law, until human conduct became one dead, dull level.", "12": "And what is our present state? The first delights of the worldly spirit have passed away, other generations have succeeded to those who witnessed the first change in Jewish sentiment, and to-day two diametrically opposite parties confront each other. The one party has inherited uncomprehended Judaism as a mechanical habit, \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05d4, without its spirit; they bear it in their hands as a sacred relic, a revered mummy, and fear to rouse its spirit. The others are partly filled with noble enthusiasm for the welfare of the Jews, but look upon Judaism as a lifeless framework, as something which should be laid in the grave of a long since dead and buried past. They seek its spirit and find it not, and are in danger, with all their efforts to help the Jew, of severing the last life-nerve of Judaism \u2014 ignorantly. And to-day, when, despite a thousand shades and variations of difference, these two opposing elements agree in the one great circumstance, that they are both wrong \u2014 what shall be done? What is the way to salvation? Does it suffice for the salvation of Judaism to establish our schools upon such a two-fold basis, and to reform our form of worship? The spirit, the inner harmonious life-principle, is lacking, and that you cannot supply through polishing the outside frame. ", "13": "There is one way to salvation; \u2014 where the sin was committed the atonement must begin, \u2014 and this one way is, to forget the inherited prejudices and opinions concerning Judaism; to go back to the sources of Judaism, to Bible, Talmud, and Midrash; to read, study, and comprehend them in order to live them; to draw from them the teachings of Judaism concerning God, the world, mankind, and Israel, according to history and precept; to know Judaism out of itself; to learn from its own utterances its science of life. With the Bible the beginning should be made, its language should first be comprehended, and then out of the spirit of the speech the spirit of the speakers should be inferred. The Bible should not be studied as an interesting object of philological or antiquarian research, not as basis for theories of taste or for amusement; it should be studied as the foundation of a new science; with Davidic sentiment nature should be contemplated; with the ear of an Isaiah history should be listened to, and then, with eye thus aroused, with ear thus opened, the doctrine of God, world, man, Israel, and Torah should be drawn from the Bible, and should become an idea, or system of ideas, fully comprehended. In this spirit Talmud should be studied, in the Halachah only further elucidation and amplification of ideas already known from the Bible should be sought for; in the Aggadah only figuratively disguised manifestation of the same spirit. This path you should pursue, unconcerned as to the opinion which the one or the other school of misled ones may hold in reference to your methods of study; unconcerned that your simplicity of interpretation will not permit you to shine among the heroes of hair-splitting, life-ignoring disputations; unconcerned if you do not shine in the special disciplines which you use only as auxiliary sciences for your general object; unconcerned if you are no longer qualified for pretentious appearance. All this should concern you little, for you are learning what is better, to know the light, the truth, the warmth, and the sublimity of life, and when you have attained to this you will comprehend Israel's history and Israel's Law, and that life, in its true sense, is the reflection of that Law, permeated with that spirit. One spirit lives in all, from the construction of the Holy Tongue to the construction of the universe and the plan of life, one spirit, the spirit of the All-One! That would be a task for the disciples of science! But the results of that science must be carried over into life, transplanted by schools. Schools for Jews! The young saplings of your people should be reared as Jews, trained to become sons and daughters of Judaism, as you have recognized and comprehended and learned to respect and love it as the law of your life. The language of the Bible and the language of the land should be theirs; in both they should be taught to think; their heart should be taught to feel, their mind to think; the Scriptures should be their book of law for life, and they should be able to comprehend life through their word. ", "14": "Their eye should be open to recognize the world around them as God's world and themselves in God's world as His servants; their ear should be open to perceive in history the narrative of the education of all men to this service. The wise precepts of Torah and Talmud should be made clear to them as designed to spiritualize their lives for such sublime service of God, and they should be taught to comprehend, respect, and love them, in order that they might rejoice in the name \"Jew\" despite all which that name implies of scorn and privation. Together with this instruction they should be fitted for bread-winning, but they should be taught that bread-winning is only a means, not the purpose of life, and that the value of life is not to be judged according to rank, wealth, or splendor, but according to the amount of good and of service to God with which it is filled. They should be taught not to subordinate the demands of their spiritual mission to those of sensuality and comfort, but the reverse, and while this training was going on, and until Israel's houses were built up of such sons and daughters, the parents should be implored and entreated not to destroy the work of the school, not to crush or choke with icy and unsympathetic mood the tender shoots of Jewish sentiment in the breasts of their children. The latent germs of a nobler disposition in the breast of parents should also be stirred, and if this be impossible, at least they should be forced to respect the sentiments they could not comprehend nor share. If these ends should be earnestly striven for, it would be different in Israel. ", "15": "It will be different in Israel; our time leads necessarily to such a change. Do not think our time so dark and hopeless, friend; it is only nervous and uncertain, as a woman in child-birth. But better the anxiety which prevails in the house of a woman about to give birth, than the freedom from anxiety, but also from joy and hope, in the house of the barren one. This time of labor may outlast our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren, but our later posterity will rejoice in the child that has struggled out into light and life, and its name will be \"self-comprehending Judaism.\" ", "16": "The age offers one pledge for the accomplishment of this result; it is the effort to think, to comprehend and to grasp with the mind that which should be respected and revered. Truly, when the mind will have realized the futility of this baseless and aimless striving, of its bargaining with the overestimated demands of the fleeting moment; when it will have clearly brought to its consciousness that the noble life can only be erected upon ideas inwardly recognized as true, then will arise the question, \"What does it mean that I am a Jew? What is Judaism?\" Nor will the answer to this question be sought at the cathedras or in the writings of non-Jewish scholars, who often see Judaism through a distorting glass and who sometimes think it necessary to destroy the teachings of Torah and Judaism in order to establish their own notions. Neither will it be sought in the writings of time-serving reformers influenced by external motives, nor in the writings of Jewish scholars who take their standpoint outside of Judaism. But the seekers after knowledge will go back to the ancient fountains of Judaism, Bible and Talmud, and the one effort will be to obtain the concept of life out of Judaism and to comprehend Judaism as the law of life, and this effort will lead to the transposing of that which holds the theory of truth and life into actual, practical truth and life, in accordance with the old adage, now, alas, nearly forgotten, \u05dc\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d5\u05dc\u05dc\u05de\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea, \"to learn and to teach, to keep and to do.\" ", "17": "O, that you all, who mean well with Judaism, which you have inherited as a habit, and which you are thinking of handing down as a habit, O, that your eyes might be opened and that you might recognize that only through the spirit can you hand it down; O, that you might at least hand to your sons and daughters the Holy Writings, the writings of the Torah, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa, so that the spirit which throbs in them might become their light and support in life; O, that you noble-minded ones, who think that you labor for the weal of Judaism; O, that you might consider that when you strike the chains from hand and foot or don fine clothing and adorn your outward persons, you do not yet help to improve or elevate life. Lower again the hand upraised to strike down the battlements of your faith, and consider whether you are not about to destroy an edifice which, even though in its covering of the dust of centuries, it appears to you worthy only of the axe's stroke, may yet contain things holy and eternal, things of life and truth; turn again toward it your averted gaze and examine what it is from which you turn away. Is it the fault of the object \u2014 should the object be held blameworthy, if those who represent it, themselves covered with the dust of the battlefield upon which they struggle against oppression and misery, could only rescue it dust-covered and made repulsive? Should we, to whom the mildness of the times has given the task of rubbing off the dust, think so little of the troubles and battles of those men as not even to deem it worth while to dust off the jewel for our own benefit, but, regarding only the dust-covered exterior, cast away as worthless the precious possession for which our ancestors sacrificed life, and property, and liberty, and all the joys of life? Should \u2014 but I forget, my dear Benjamin, that only heaven hears these wishes, that only this paper sees them, and that only to you will they be shown; I forget that I am writing only to you. Light and truth and life will emerge from this time of trial; be sure of that, friend, and then you will regard differently that which I was accustomed to lament with you, the apparently chaotic condition of the spiritual affairs of our people; no government, no authority, all efforts solely individual, and, through the lust for reform, the religious service, about which the whole movement turns, has become so variegated that a Jew, travelling through Germany, might almost find it different in every congregation. Do you not see that this also may have its good? I am convinced that none of those of us now living comprehend Judaism in its true purity and truth. Consider also the divergency of opinions, quite natural inasmuch as almost every Rabbi strikes out his own path and is led by no schools. Consider furthermore that we are only in the time of labor; it would be unfortunate if an authority tried to establish something \u2014 it would only make our sorrows eternal! It would be impossible to select proper men. If one-sided, they would perpetuate extravagances; if composed of minglea elements representing various ideas, their creation would be a half-thing, a torso, and would only serve to dam the stream of development, which can only bring pure and living water when permitted to flow to its uttermost end. Time, if left unhindered, will wash away what it itself has brought into existence, and room will always remain for the higher edifice which yet awaits us. I think that if, in the period after Maimonides, anxiety for the maintenance of Judaism in external practice had not made it necessary to suppress antagonistic efforts, centuries ago the improper tendencies of the Jewish spirit would, through the very completeness of their fulfillment, have brought about sober reflection upon the nature and purposes of our faith, and we would now be whither we can only expect to come in centuries. Under present conditions I rejoice that the scales hang free, held by God alone, and that only intellectual efforts mutually balance each other, but that no temporal power can interpose the sword to check the freedom of the swinging. If it should be stopped, our great grandchildren would be no better off than we. Should we fear to go through the period of anxiety for them? ", "18": "Let the scales swing! The freer they hang, and the more violently now they swing up and down, the truer and purer will be the estimate of the right principle of faith and life which they will finally fix. And when the scales have ceased to swing, and when all luminous will stand in Israel, the Spirit of Understanding, \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, the spirit which understands itself, its history, and its law, when its throbbing impulse of life will have pervaded all its members; when the branch gone forth from Israel shall have performed its mission and fought to victory a battle of another kind in the midst of our non- Jewish brethren; when the free gaze uplifted to the All-One, and the consciousness of inner moral power shall have conquered whatever dims the eye and corrupts noble vigor . . . then will the book of our history have been written, and its final teachings will have penetrated all spirits. Let us comprehend our time, dear Benjamin, and let every one, according to the measure of intellectual and spiritual power vouchsafed him, strive to further the progress to the goal, each in the greater or smaller circle in which he lives. Thousands may forsake the cause of life and light, thousands may tear themselves away from the lot and the name of Israel, whose mode of life they have long since rejected \u2014 the cause of truth counts not the number of its adherents. If only one remains \u2014 one Jew with the book of the law in his hand, with Israel's law in his heart, Israel's light in his spirit \u2014 that one suffices; Israel's cause is not lost. When Israel had grown unfit for its mission, the All-One desired to permit the law and the mission of Israel to be borne by the one Moses, and the prophet tells us timid ones the same truth: ", "19": "\"Gaze upon the rock from which we were hewn, ", "2": "In two academies the Law and the spirit sought refuge, but passion and error soon sapped the foundations of these noble institutions and destroyed them; the Law went into exile, the letter and its external practical fulfillment were saved, but the spirit, preserved only in the symbolical concealment of the letter, disappeared. The spirit could only be comprehended by deduction from the letter and the veiling symbol, together with the higher insight which individuals had preserved. In that dark time there were not lacking individuals who shone forth conspicuous through the true understanding of the spirit of Judaism which they possessed, but they were the exceptions; not all were endowed with such mental elevation. ", "20": "Upon the fountain-hollowing mallet with which ye were dug! ", "21": "Gaze upon Abraham, your father, ", "22": "Upon Sarah, destined to bear ye. ", "23": "One only was he when I called him; ", "24": "I blessed him and made him many.\" ", "25": "Farewell, dear Benjamin, train yourself to be such a one; farewell. ", "3": "Israel's youth, as a rule, trained their minds in non-Jewish schools, in independent, philosophic studies, and drew from Arabic sources the concepts of the Greek philosophy. As the highest purpose of human existence they learned to consider self-perfectation through the knowledge of truth. Their awakeued minds felt themselves in contradiction to Judaism, whose spirit they did not comprehend; their life-view was opposed to a view of life which lays chiefest stress upon the deed, upon action, and looks upon knowledge only as a means to such action. The age gave birth to a man, a mind, who, the product of uncomprehended Judaism and Arabic science, was obliged to reconcile the strife which raged in his own breast in his own manner, and who, by proclaiming it to the world, became the guide of all in whom the same conflict existed. ", "4": "This great man, to whom, and to whom alone, we owe the preservation of practical Judaism to our time, is responsible, because he sought to reconcile Judaism with the difficulties which confronted it from without, instead of developing it creatively from within, for all the good and the evil which bless and afflict the heritage of the father. His peculiar mental tendency was Arabic-Greek, and his conception of the purpose of life the same. He entered into Judaism from without, bringing with him opinions of whose truth he had convinced himself from extraneous sources and \u2014 he reconciled. For him, too, self-perfecting through the knowledge of truth was the highest aim, the practical he deemed subordinate. For him knowledge of God was the end, not the means; hence he devoted his intellectual powers to speculations upon the essence of Deity, and sought to bind Judaism to the results of his speculative investigations as to postulates of science or faith. The Mizvoth became for him merely ladders, necessary only to conduct to knowledge or to protect against error, this latter often only the temporary and limited error of polytheism. Mishpatim became only rules of prudence, Mitzvoth as well; Chukkim rules of health, teaching right feeling, defending against the transitory errors of the time; Edoth ordinances, designed to promote philosophical or other concepts; all this having no foundation in the eternal essence of things, not resulting from their eternal demand on me, or from my eternal purpose and task, no eternal symbolizing of an unchangeable idea, and not inclusive enough to form a basis for the totality of the commandments. ", "5": "He, the great systematic orderer of the practical results of the Talmud, gives expression in the last part of his philosophic work to opinions concerning the meaning and purpose of the commandments which, taking the very practical results codified by himself as the contents of the commandments, are utterly untenable \u2014 cast no real light upon them, and cannot go hand in hand with them in practice, in life, and in science. These are the views which have been inherited up to the present day by those who care at all to understand the spirit of the Mitzvoth. But since the precepts, as practically fulfilled, stand entirely out of connection with these explanations, it was inevitable that their ceremonial fulfillment lost its spiritual basis, and became despised. You see, instead of taking one's stand within Judaism, and asking, \"Inasmuch as Judaism makes these demands of me, what opinion of the purpose of man must it have?\" instead of comprehending each demand in its totality according to Bible and Talmud, and then asking, \"What is the reason and idea of this injunction?\" people set up their standpoints outside of Judaism, and sought to draw it over to them; they conceived a priori opinions as to what the Mitzvoth might be, without disturbing themselves as to the real appearance of the Mitzvoth in all its parts. What was the consequence? After these opinions had brought about the natural phenomenon that men who believed themselves the possessors of the knowledge which the commandments were designed to inculcate, thought themselves absolved both from the fulfillment of the commandment, intended only as a guide, and from the study of the science of the commandments, which had lost for them all intellectual significance; other men, possessed of a deeper comprehension of Judaism, became at first enemies of this philosophical spirit, and later, of all specifically intellectual and philosophical pursuits in general. Certain misunderstood utterances were taken as weapons with which to repel all higher intellectual interpretation of the Talmud; no distinction was made between the question, \"What is stated here?\" and the question, \"Why is it stated?\" and not even the category of Edoth, which, according to its whole nature, was designed to stir the mind to activity, was excluded from the excommunication of the intellectual. Another misunderstood passage, (\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e1\u05e0\u05d4\u05d3\u05e8\u05d9\u05df \u05db\u05f4\u05d3 \u05d0 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05f4 \u05d3\u05f4\u05d4), even led later to the suppression of Bible study, an error against which Prophecy expressly warns (\u05d4\u05f4\u05dc\u05f4\u05d8 \u05de\u05e1\u05f4 \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4 \u05d8 \u05d5). The inevitable consequence was, therefore, that since oppression and persecution had robbed Israel of every broad and natural view of the world and of life, and the Talmud had yielded about all the practical results for life of which it was capable, every mind that felt the desire of independent activity was obliged to forsake the paths of study and research in general open to the human intellect, and to take its recourse to dialectic subtleties and hair-splittings. Only a very few during this entire period stood with their intellectual efforts entirely within Judaism, and built it up out of its own inner concepts. Most distinguished among them are the author of the \"Cuzari,\" and the son of Nachman. This condition of uncomprehended Judaism became particularly prevalent in Germany, where ages of persecution and oppression suppressed every freer upward movement of the mind. The general fundamental principle, God the All-One and the Torah His will, and the fulfillment of the Law in the fear of God and with love for, and faith in Him, retained, however, everywhere its living force; and life, with all its possessions and all its pleasures, was offered with magnificent devotion as a willing sacrifice to it. A form of learning came into existence, concerning which, as a layman, I do not venture to express a judgment, but which, if I comprehend aright the little that I know, is an invaluable repository of the spirit of Bible and Talmud, but which has been, unfortunately, misunderstood; and what should have been eternal, progressive development, was considered a stationary mechanism, and the inner significance and concept thereof as extra-mundane dream-worlds. This learning came into existence, and the mind turned either to the external ingenious development of the Talmud, or to this learning, which appealed to the emotions as well. Practical Judaism, which, comprehended in its purity, would perhaps have been impregnated with the spiritual became in it, through misconception, a magical mechanism, a means of influencing or resisting theosophic worlds and anti-worlds. ", "6": "Little by little there came into the hands of the people a part of a work, originally intended only as a compendium for the learned and containing the last results of Talmudic legal science, codified for ceremonial practice. It was essentially nothing but a differently arranged edition of the systematic work of Maimonides, by which this latter had become the great preserver of practical Judaism in the times of the greatest Galuth-oppression. Unfortunately, however, it was almost exclusively one part of this work which came into the hands of people, containing only the divisions Edoth and Abodah, referring to worship and holy days; the other parts, which treat of the other duties, were left for the learned, and did not become the possession of the people. Gradually the unfortunate opinion developed that Judaism meant nothing but praying and keeping holy days; its significance for life in general remained unrecognized. ", "7": "Considering all these influences together, you will be able to comprehend the appearance which Judaism presented, say, eighty years ago. The subsequent events will also be intelligible to you. When the external yoke began to grow lighter, and the spirit felt itself freer, then arose a brilliant, respect-inspiring personality, Mendelssohn, which by its commanding influence has led the later development up to this day. This commanding individual, who had not drawn his mental development from Judaism, who was great chiefly in philosophical disciplines, in metaphysics, and aesthetics, who treated the Bible only philologically and aesthetically, and did not build up Judaism as a science from itself, but merely defended it against political stupidity and pietistic Christian audacity, and who was personally an observant Jew, accomplished this much, that he showed the world and his brethren that it was possible to be a strictly religious Jew and yet to shine distinguished as the German Plato.", "8": "This \"and yet\" was decisive. His followers contented themselves with developing Bible study in the philologic-sesthetic sense, with studying the Moreh, and with pursuing and spreading humanistic letters; but Judaism, Bible and Talmud as Jewish science, were neglected. Even the most zealous study of the Bible was of no avail for the comprehension of Judaism, because it was not treated as the authoritative source of doctrine and instruction, but only as a beautiful poetic storehouse from which to draw rich supplies for the fancy and the imagination. The Talmud thus neglected, practical Judaism thus completely uncomprehended, it was but natural that the former symbolizing and abstract interpretation of Judaism, which had for a time been interrupted, again became prevalent, and was carried to an extreme which threatened to destroy all Judaism. If that view of life be true, which places the highest mission of man n the recognition of truth; and who could venture to doubt it, seeing that Maimonides has declared so; above all, if those views concerning the requirements of the Torah be true; and who could dare to think otherwise, since Maimonides, the great authority on Talmud, and himself an observant Jew, had propounded them; then, indeed, the many-foliod Talmud is nothing but a wearisome mass of hair-splitting subtleties, useful only for the accumulation of dust and moths; then, indeed, is practical Judaism nothing but unreasoning weariness of the flesh: who could resist this conclusion? ", "9": "If, for instance, the sole purpose of the prohibition of labor on the Sabbath was to enable men to rest and recover from the toils of the week, if the Sabbath means only the cessation of corporeal activity in order that the mind may be active; and who could doubt it, since both Moses interpret it thus, and the Christian Sunday agrees with their conception, who must not consider it mere pettiness and pedantic absurdity to fill an entire folio with the investigation of the question, what particular actions are forbidden, and what permitted on the Sabbath day? How singular, to declare the writing of two letters, perhaps an intellectual occupation, a deadly sin, while judging leniently many acts involving great physical exertion, and freeing from penalty all purposeless destruction! Why, it even forbids the hen to lay eggs! Or, to go over to another domain, if sacrifice means only to give of one's possessions in grateful recognition that they come from God, or if, in its special Biblical form, it was mainly designed as a protest against the polytheistic sacrificial usages then prevailing; how absurd it is, to fill three or four folios with investigations concerning the manner of offering sacrifice, the part which might be used, the persons who might officiate, and the permissible times! Do you not see, that all this is only mind-destroying priest-craft? Therefore; therefore \u2014 many conclusions could be and were drawn, but before drawing them, people should have asked themselves, \"Is Moses the son of Maimon, or Moses the son of Mendel, really identical with Moses the son of Amram?\" Is there not contained in this dissonance between the theory of the Mitzvah and its reality a proof that the explanation is not right, that it is not based upon the complete conception of the Mitzvah, but is \u2014 dreamed into it from without?

On the day when you consecrate unto yourself the wife, with whose aid you are to erect a house in Israel, I shall offer you the only present you seek; I shall grant the request which you have so often uttered to me. I shall, if God gives me understanding and health, lay upon my people's altar the only offering which, in my weakness, I am able to place thereon. I do not entertain in connection with it the sanguine hopes with which you have welcomed this resolve. I have revealed to you in writing and orally what I have cherished for a long time as my dearest treasure, and you have accepted it with warm appreciation as truth; but I do not imagine on that account that it will be acknowledged by all as truth, or that I may deem it with certainty the pure gold of truth. I know too well both my own limitations and the character of the age to be led astray by such roseate hopes. But I consider it the duty of every one, in a time of such solemn import, and in behalf of a cause which is to us the holiest and most sacred, to make known his opinions openly and honestly. And if I should only succeed in demonstrating that the matter has not been thoroughly investigated in all its aspects, that there is, perhaps, a way by means of which one could reach entirely different results than those hitherto attained, a view in the light of which everything would present an appearance quite different from that hitherto customary and usual; yes, if I should only succeed in staying one hand that had been too swiftly raised in order to tear down, and could induce its owner instead calmly to examine; indeed, if I could come no nearer to the goal that I have often pictured to you in letters than to induce another to step upon the road which I have prepared, another, more talented, more richly equipped with intellectual light and strength than I, and he should demonstrate so clearly the truth and dignity, the life and the light contained in the edifice of Judaism that my feeble attempts would arouse but a pitying smile and be forgotten; friend, my reward would even then be greater than I have dared to hope. Nor do you err when you think that modest diffidence has restrained me so long from undertaking a task which must long since have spoken within me.

May the wife whom you to-day call \"consecrated,\" be consecrated to you ever as your holiest possession. May the house which you establish together be pure and holy and godly, as the holy symbol of the \"robe\" with which you enwrap yourselves. May the \"cup of life\" from which you both shall drink, hold ever so much of the sweet that you shall never despair, so much of the bitter that you shall never grow over-proud; and may you accept all abundance of blessing as means given you by the hand of God, to live a life of righteousness and love.

Fame or acknowledgment of my personal merit are not the objects which I seek, or else they indeed would have been right whose judgment already sounds in my ears as that of the multitude: \"He understands but ill the world and his time, and what it demands.\" No such motive has prompted me to these efforts, but only the inner voice which, though I listen and examine my inmost thoughts a thousand times, speaks ever to me the same words, saying: \"There is some truth in your views, some of that truth which, you think, must ultimately struggle forth into the light of victory; the way upon which you have begun to walk is perhaps only a by-path, but it leads in the right direction, and if one abler than you should begin to pursue it, the cause of truth would surely prevail.\" This voice alone stirred me on. Surely, friend, a grain of truth is worth the sacrifice of my person, even if I should sacrifice it a thousand times. This care has never made me hesitate, but other cares have filled me with anxiety, when I asked myself whether I would not do harm where I thought to help. The view of the reconstruction of Judaism as a science I have evolved almost alone out of my inner consciousness. Only one dear friend assisted me a little in the smaller, easier, and clearer part, and only one star guided me somewhat in the beginning. I have worked myself through to the point where you found me. But may it not be that upon this way, where at every step thorns and refuse had to be removed, and I, with my limited powers, was called upon alone to take issue with the entire past and the entire present, may it not well be, I ask, that I have entered into a thousand devious paths, and accepted a thousand errors as truths? Is the edifice, as it stands within me, and as I would show it to my brethren, is it free from defects? And if the attempt should fail, would not those who would like to erase from the book of life the cause for which I live, would they not make use of my unsuccessful attempts as a means of strangling the dearly beloved cause? How they would gloat over my failure and say, \"See there, some new attempts to rehabilitate Judaism \u2014 entire failures!\" I am not constituted for a writer; all my life I have thought more than spoken, spoken more than written; will I be able to write for truth with the clearness which convinces the mind, the power which captures the heart? I must, if I would speak to the children of the time, address them in German (i.e. modern) language and German writing, and as surely as I know that Judaism, rightly comprehended and rightly presented, unites all creatures with a band of love and justice, so surely do I also know that evil disposed calumniators can and do take isolated passages, torn out of their connection, interpreted in contradiction to their true spirit, and without consideration of the entire edifice of which they form but an insignificant part, and use them as pointed arrows and ponderous cudgels with which to smite and wound helpless victims. Will my efforts have a better fate? Will not some one whose sensitive spirit has been insulted and offended by rude audacity, be able to point to me as the \u2014 even though innocent \u2014 cause? Many other cares of a similar kind oppressed me. ", "4": "\"How did you answer all these questions,\" I hear you ask, \"since after all you did resolve to undertake the work ?\" \"Because,\" I thought, \"I have climbed alone to a height, from which a new view displays itself to me. On that very account it devolves on me to summon companions, to descend and to begin again the journey with the friends who will join me. I only wish to give what I have until now been able to gather together, not as a perfect work, but truly 'as essays.'\" Can it injure the cause in the eyes of the sensible if a single immature youth has, perhaps, dreamed dreams that are utterly baseless and unreal? Then there is the question of duty. I see a child enveloped in flames; the bystanders are timidly inactive, or seek only to save the building. I see the child, \u2014 I rush in; \u2014 need I ask first my neighbor whether he, too, sees the child; have I the right to consider whether, in my hasty rush, I may not knock some neighbor bloody; may I even ask whether, in my haste to save the child, I am not hindering the task of saving the building or producing a draught, which may start the fire to fresh activity? \"But suppose you see the child too late, and before you reach it the building falls with hiss and crash upon its poor head?\"", "5": "Even if it should bury me, too, in its ruins, I would but have done my duty. ", "6": "Of course, my dear Benjamin, the natural way would have been to have labored first only for the scientific evolvement, and whatever would have demonstrated in the battle of minds its truth and tenability would have been afterwards quietly transferred into the practice of life. That would have been the quieter, the surer, the pleasanter way. ", "7": "But our time demands a different course. In Mendelssohn's days, when the new movement of the spirit had begun but the Jewish life was yet untouched, then it would have been possible to construct the science of Judaism, and to bring to the strong formal life the light and warmth of the spirit, and our condition would be different now. To-day it is no longer possible. The opinions, not derived from true Judaism, have become active and vigorous, and labor with hostile energy to undermine that which they pretend to represent. They must be combatted directly in the midst of life, so that many who still observe may comprehend what they observe; that many who reject may hesitate and examine that which they reject; that many a hand, now raised, perhaps, in honest zeal to tear down or to build up something new, be held back, and its owner be induced to inquire carefully concerning that which he had purposed to tear down or to build in other form, and with new additions. Later it would devolve upon the men of science to establish in science, and as science, the principles which we had actively defended in life. That is the way in which I intend to proceed. If Heaven will vouchsafe me health and understanding, I shall endeavor to declare in a first part the views on Judaism concerning God, the world, man, Israel, the Torah; in a second part to expound the Mitzvoth, as far as it is incumbent upon us, deprived of our national soil , to fulfill them; the passages of the Torah shall always precede; then shall follow the views concerning them with which the study of several years have furnished me, and then, for the purpose of practical fulfillment, extracts from the fourfold code, the Shulchan Aruch, shall follow. Everything shall be treated popularly, directly for life, and its demonstration in Jewish science shall be left as a later task, as you now have this part in your hands. I rejoice that the first impulse to these essays was derived from the necessity of supplying the teachers of the schools under my supervision with a book in which they could read themselves into Jews before they began to rear young souls for Judaism; and in elaborating them for larger circles of readers, I always thought of the intellectual ", "8": "youths and maidens of my people as their chief readers.

To be sure you are right, in your description of the plan, that the knowledge of the general should precede that of the particular, and such is, indeed, the plan of my work. Nevertheless I shall publish the particular first. I know well that I will thereby rouse up more opponents, for people are readier to acknowledge principles before they have obtained a full view of the consequences to which they logically lead. Still I cannot do otherwise.

In these isolated, uncomprehended tasks and duties Israel's essence is misunderstood, attacked, annihilated. At this spot the greatest stream flows away, and here the first effort should be made to repair the breach. When the demonstration has been given as to the special contents of Judaism, then the gaze may be lifted higher and the question be answered as to the position which Judaism, as a whole, occupies in the series of other phenomena, what its relation to mankind, what the position of man in the world as comprehended from Judaism, what the relation of the world to God, of God to it. If the first part appeared first, people would look upon that which I say of Israel as a mere dream picture, a creation of the enthusiastic fancy, nowhere existing in reality. In order, however, to give my readers as much knowledge of the general as is absolutely necessary to the understanding of the special, I shall first sketch out some general outlines, such as I tried to give you in the beginning of our correspondence, and I have endeavored in the case of each particular Mitzvah to lead the reader to an understanding of its significance as based upon its relation to Judaism in general.

We will now open it together. You will agree, my Benjamin, that what we wish is to become acquainted with Israel, to learn the import and significance of this name, which we bear by reason of birth, what we are and should be as bearers thereof. But Israel is an historical phenomenon among the other manifestations of the world's records, and therefore the next question is, what is the meaning of history? History, however differently we may conceive it, is without doubt the way to fulfill the destiny of man in universal humanity, therefore the next question is, what is man, what should he be? But man is not isolated, he is a creature amidst the other creatures, affected by and affecting them; therefore we must next ask, what is the world? Israel, history, man-kind, the world \u2014 they all can only be comprehended through God, the creator, as a work of art is only then perfectly understood, when we have an insight into the plans of the master, and to our eye God reveals himself only in His works.

On the contrary, in a series of ten developments God called His world into existence, created an abundance of forces, and caused them to pervade each other, and influence each other, in accordance with His will \u2014 uniting and separating them in such a manner, that each should assist in maintaining the other ; that none should contain alone the conditions of its existence and activity in itself, but should receive from fellow beings, and impart to fellow beings, the potencies of life and work.\" He, in His infinite wisdom, ordained this mutual interdependence in order that each individual being might contribute, with its measure of force, whether much or little, to the preservation of the All, so that whatsoever being should destroy, a fellow creature should thereby deprive itself of a condition of its own life. Thus water, having penetrated the earth, is collected in cloud, and sea; light, having pierced the earthy crust and brought forth plants, children of light and heat, is concentrated again into sun, moon, and stars; the germ, offspring of earth, is taken from the earth and given to the crown of ripened fruit, which henceforth the earth must receive that it give \u2014 thus one glorious chain of love, of giving and receiving, unites all creatures; none is by or for itself, but all things exist in continual reciprocal activity \u2014 the one for the All; the All for the One. None has power, or means, for itself; it receives in order to give; gives in order to receive, and finds therein the accomplishment of the purpose of its existence. \"\u05d4,\" \"Love,\" say the sages, \"love which bears and is born is the type of creation.\" \"Love,\" is the message which all things proclaim to thee.

What is his place in this throng of creatures of God, this choir of servants of the Lord? Though the Torah were silent, would not the contemplation of creation, would not your own breast tell you? Man, is he not also a creature of God? Should he not also be a servant of God? Every fiber of your body is a creation from the hand of God, formed by Him, arranged by Him, endowed by Him with power. Your spirit, that world of powers, is the creation of God from beginning to end. The divine spark, your personality, which, invisible as Deity, weaves and works in this microcosm, and under whose control stand intellect and body and the power to use the entire realm of nature for its purpose, this mysterious spritual force in you is itself emanation of Deity. Learn to deem yourself holy as creature of God and, while contemplating heaven and earth and the great chorus of servants of the Lord, consecrate yourself to your mission, and proclaim yourself with mingled solemnity and joy, \"servant of God!\" Since all things, the smallest and the greatest, are God's chosen messengers, to work, each in its place, and with its measure of power, according to the law of the Most High, taking only that it may give again, should man alone be excluded from this circle of blessed activity? Can he be born only to take? \u2014 to revel in lavish plenty or to starve in misery, but not to work? \u2014 not to fill any place, nor fulfill any purpose, but to let all end in himself? The world and all which is therein serves God; is it conceivable that man alone should only serve himself? No! Your consciousness pronounces you as does the Torah, \u05e6\u05dc\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \"an image of God.\" That is what man should be. Only when working out some end canst thou know God in love and righteousness; to work out ends of righteousness and love art thou called; not merely to enjoy or suffer. All which thou possessest, spirit, body, human beings, wealth, every ability and every power, they are means of activity; \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d4 to promote and preserve the world were they given \u2014 love and righteousness. Not thine is the earth, but thou belongest to the earth, to respect it as Divine soil and to deem every one of its creatures a creature of God, thy fellow-being; to respect and love it as such, and as such to endeavor to bring it nearer to its goal, according to the will of God. For this reason every being impresses upon thy spirit an image of itself; for this reason thy heart-strings pulsate sympathetically with every cry of distress heard anywhere in creation, or with every tone of joy which issues anywhere from a gladsome being; therefore thou rejoicest when the flower blooms and sorrowest when it fades. The law to which all powers submit unconsciously and involuntarily, to it shall thou also subordinate thyself, but consciously and of thy own free will. \"Knowledge and freedom,'\" these words indicate at once the sublime mission and the lofty privilege of man. All forces stand as servitors around the throne of God, their capacity is hidden from themselves and covered are their countenances, so that they can not see the reason of their mission, but they feel within them winged power to act, and act in accordance with their purpose. Thou, O man, thy countenance is half uncovered, thy capacity is half revealed, thou canst comprehend thyself as creature of God \u2014 canst at least faintly appreciate the notion of the mission which He breathed into thy ear; canst thou see thyself encompassed round about by God's active servants, canst thou feel in thyself power to a6l and wilt thou not joyously join in the cry of the great chorus of servants,  \u05e0\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05e2  \"we will do and therefore hearken?

Therefore thou shalt be first and highest servitor in the company of servants!", "1": "Not by that which we gain, my dear Benjamin, can our vocation be determined, not according to the extent of external or internal possessions which we gather in external or internal storehouses, should we estimate the value of our lives; what we accomplish, what results proceed from us, these should fix our vocation, and in proportion as we use our external and internal possessions to fulfill the will of God and utilize every capacity, small or great, for a truly human, God-serving deed, will be the measure of our value. The attainment of internal or external possessions has only a value as the means of securing ability for such activity. From the slightest mental power and the nerve ganglia which minister to it, to the executive force of your hand with which you alter creation, and to which the entire realm of nature is subject, and every being which ever came within your reach \u2014 all of these are means lent to you \u2014 which one day will appear as witnesses for or against you, before the throne of God, and will testify whether you neglected or used them well, whether you wrought with them blessing or curse. There exists, therefore, an external measure for the deeds of men, correspondence to the will of God \u2014 and an internal measure for the greatness of men \u2014 not the extent of powers conferred, not the amount of results achieved, but the fulfillment of the Divine will in proportion to the power possessed. Life, therefore, may be an utter failure in spite of the purest sentiments, if the deeds done be not right; or may, on the other hand, be most sublime despite infinitesimal results, if the means did not suffice for more. Happiness and perfection are, therefore, nothing but the greatest plenitude of external and internal possessions which, only when employed in accordance with the will of God, constitute the greatness of man. The angel whose province it is to supervise the coming into existence of man, says one of the sages, takes the germ which is to be a human being, brings it before the Holy One, blessed be He, and asks, \"This germ, what shall become of it in life ? Shall he that proceeds from it be strong or weak, wise or simple, rich or poor?\" He does not ask whether he will be good or bad, pious or sinful, for all things depend upon the decree of God, except virtue and the fear of the Lord, the pious reverence of heaven, these the Almighty leaves to the free will of men.

Thus man in his earthly frame belongs to earth, and his terrestrial existence is full of significance. As no passing breath, and no ephemeral grass-blade or butterfly exists for nought, but furnishes its contribution, slight though it be, which God's wisdom uses for the upbuilding of the All ; thus also no pleasure, no thought, no deed, trifling though it be, is empty and purposeless; those which are right are finished work delivered into the hand of God that He may employ them for the completion of His universe-plan. Fulfillment of the Divine will with our property and our pleasures, with our thoughts, words, and deeds, that should be the contents of our lives. And we should strive to ascertain this will. For that is the special and peculiar greatness of man, that whereas the voice of God speaks in or throiLgh all other creatures, to him it Speaks directly that he accept voluntarily its precepts as propelling force of his life-activity. Go to, my Benjamin, and examine yourself; examine yourself in comparison with a grass-blade or a rolling thunder-peal, and if you do not, despite all your wealth of property and enjoyment of inner and outer possessions, blush with shame and veil your face in the presence of the angelic grandeur of such creatures, because of your selfish pettiness; and if you do not then rouse yourself with all your strength, with every spark of your being, to acquire for yourself such angelic power, then go and lament the degradation which the age has brought upon you.", "30": "Bless also thou, O my soul, the Lord.\"", "4": "\"Bless, O my soul, the Lord, ", "5": "And all my inner parts recognize His holiness!

What youth, still capable of enthusiasm for the noble, could contemplate Heaven and earth and their hosts, or could reflect upon their work, or the work of any single creature, without forming a notion of his task in life consonant with his dignity as a human being, or could do otherwise than to cast away with shame and contempt the idols of silver and gold, and particularly the universal idol, \"Pleasure?\" The object of such insight into the true mission of humanity, and of the consequent renunciation of sensual enjoyments, is not, however, indolent withdrawal from the active tasks of life, but, on the contrary, manly vigor, and the pursuit of the highest aims, using human possessions and capacities, not, however, as ends, but as means. The richer Heaven makes you in internal and external possessions, the more exhaustive fulfillment of His will He demands of you; the wider-extended and all-embracing does your duty become. You are right also in saying that the mere contemplation of the abilities of man is sufficient to prove it his duty to accomplish some end. Consider, furthermore, how his whole physical and intellectual constitution clearly indicates the tasks for the carrying out of which he is adapted; his head is borne proudly erect that his eyes may examine and inspect the world in which he moves; his hands are equipped with mobile fingers admirably fitted for the work of the artist and sculptor; his intellectual power is sufficient to know the things which shall serve him as means to his ends, but beyond that the path of knowledge is difficult and dangerous, and pursued but by few; the development of his mental force is itself dependent upon external means, upon words and communications ; but, in contradistinction thereto, the heart, the source of all action, is capable of embracing all beings in regard and love, is capable of the greatest increase, of unlimited progress. ", "1": "You are right also in asserting that, thus understood, revelation of the Divine will is absolutely required, whether external or internal, or both. I am not at all surprised that you can not follow me in my Biblical interpretations. For the present, therefore, accept my outlined statements as though they were mere personal hypotheses of my own; investigate their intrinsic truth; familiarize yourself with the thought: \"How would it be if this were really the contents of the Torah?\" and leave it to me to demonstrate later that such is really the case. Let us now continue. We have now, guided by the Torah, ascertained the position of man in creation. Neither as god nor as slave shall he stand in the midst of the creatures of the earth-world; but as brother, as co-working brother, occupying, however, the rank of first-born among his brother beings, because of the peculiar nature and extent of his service; he is to be administrator of the whole Divine estate, the earth-world; to provide and care for all therein according to the will of God. From God alone, source of all might, does man derive the right to take for his own use the earth-world, but with this right comes also the duty, only to appropriate the permitted, and to use that in strict accordance with the will of the Giver. \"Good\" should be for him only that which agrees with this Divine will and with the disposition fixed for objects by Divine wisdom; \"evil\" only that which stands in opposition to these principles. Not that should be deemed good or evil which is agreeable or disagreeable to him, man; which is pleasant or unpleasant to his sensual nature, or that which harmonizes with, or is opposed to, principles, arbitrarily selected by himself without reference to the will of Deity. ", "2": "For neither the gratification of impulses and lusts, nor ambitious self-aggrandizement and caprice constitute the task of man, but he shall elevate all his power, desires, and physical qualities to be means of carrying out the will of God, of bringing him nearer to his sought-for goal. Man's freedom, of course, postulates the possibility of mistakes and error. ", "3": "Man has the duty to submit willingly to the law which all others are compelled to obey, and this naturally implies that he has also the power to disobey it. Through his animal portion, his body with its desires, he is threatened with sensual lust; that, dazzled by the charm of the pleasant sensations which the Divine love has caused to accompany every act of satisfying his needs, he may no longer regard pleasure as the means but as the end itself. Through the power of his intellect he is threatened with pride, that because of his ability to control material things, and to alter them in accordance with a certain perceived purpose, he may look upon himself as master, forgetting thereby God the Lord, forgetting, also, that all things are Divine possessions lent him for specific purposes, and may usurp to himself the right to subject all to the domination of his own will. Deepest degradation may result when his entire effort is devoted to the gratification of animal lust, and the mind of the ruler lowers itself to be the slave of the beast, employing all its skill only to secure the gratification of bestial desires. Then is man the most dangerous beast of prey, for he is armed with intellect, and the whole world is not safe against the caprices of his passions. ", "4": "Scripture omits to narrate any revelation of God's will to mankind in general, as it reserves this for the later history of a special nation, to which all which precedes but serves as a guide and an introduction. ", "5": "One educational commandment appears, and then man and his education by God are shown. A world is laid at man's feet for him to possess and enjoy, but one enjoyment is interdicted, without revealed reason, solely as a decree of the Most High. For man should subordinate himself to his Creator, and for him highest wisdom consists in obeying the will of God as the will of his God. But to be willing to fulfill the behests of that will only when or because they appear also to us right and wise and good, could that be called obedience to God? Would not that rather be obedience to oneself? Lust and desire for pleasure tempt us with seductive words : \"How attractive it is, how agreeable, how sweet!\" Pride of intellect adds also its contribution to the words dictated by desire: \"Have not we also mind, intelligence, and understanding? Can we not, like gods, know of ourselves what is good and what bad? Why, nothing is easier! How sweet it is, is it conceivable that it should not be good? Besides, unto us belongs the earth and the fulness thereof!\" Thus only the sweet is regarded by man as good, as bad only the bitter. The history of all sin is the same. God reveals Himself as Judge, but also as Father and Teacher. Verily, judgment is His prerogative, for does not the earth, and the fulness thereof, belong to Him? Have we not received from, yea, from Him alone, power and right to acquire and to enjoy? If we misuse this power but once, stretch out our hand but a single time toward that which is forbidden, have we not thereby forfeited all claim to the right of existence on earth? \"On the day when thou disregardest the prohibition, thou shalt surely forfeit thy life,\" is the warning of the just Judge. Nevertheless, God does not exact the incurred penalty of sin from His fallen child, but strives, with paternal love and forbearance, to guide him to the right. ", "6": "The path to pleasure is made difficult to discourage the development of the animal side of his being and to render less arrogant his pride; that the real man in him be led upwards to God, through realization of the limitations of his power, and that something else must be his task and his greatness than that which can be thus easily conferred upon him, or taken from him. Thus also every one of us is taught even to-day. In our experience God's paternal teaching speaks to us. Into the realm of the temporal each one enters pure and capable of attaining to the highest stage of human greatness. That you are born in this particular hour, in this certain place, amid such and such surroundings, with your own special parents, brothers, and sisters, and with the definite measure of intellectual and physical powers and material possession which you hold; that you find certain teachers, acquaintances, and friends, that is the Eden into which God puts you. But it is not given that you may in pride forget Him and cling to temporal possessions as tho they were the eternal good. Do that and sorrows \u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea will enter into your life-tabernacle, which will throw you back into your own insignificance, and will forcibly inform you that all, parents and family, friends and acquaintances, wealth and possessions, body and soul, are but gifts \u2014 gifts of God, and that you in yourself are not all. You are here to use every possession as an instrument put into your hands to help you fulfill the will of God. ", "7": "But freedom delays the success of education. Through labor pride is nurtured, and man calls \"his\" the soil which he has moistened with his sweat (\u05e7\u05d9\u05df); the necessity of providing for the satisfying of physical cravings, which demand an increasingly large portion of the good things of the world, exalts again the animal in man; he sees in himself only an animal, and deems his mind only a means of procuring the gratification of physical desires; the human in man sinks (\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd) That which could lift him up, the acknowledgment of God as the only Ruler and Father, and, therefore, of everything else as creature and servant, and consequently of himself, as well as servant and child, this acknowledgment has grown dim. For as soon as man ceases to look upon himself as the empowered guardian and administrator of the earth-world, as soon as he endeavors to carry out, not the will of God, but his own will, and ceases to be servant of God; he sees no longer in the strength-endowed beings around him the servitors of Deity, but independent forces which seek possession, lust, and power, he has no eye any more for the law of the All-One whom they all serve, and the world divides itself for him into as many gods as he sees forces in operation. For him the sun does not shine, nor the thunder roll, the lightning flash, or the earth deck itself in green; the storm roar, or the living beings reproduce their kind, because they must, but because they wish, for the consciousness of the law is gone from his own breast. He, therefore, desiring only possession and lust, becomes a slave of the beings from which he hopes to obtain that which he desires, he bends the knee to the creatures (\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9) until finally, recognizing the omnipotence of his passions, he deifies them; and, furthermore, since all beings seem to him not servants of a great world-plan, but independent forces, seeking power and lust, he soon ceases to look upon the pursuit of power and lust as bestial and unworthy of man, but deems it divine, man's most worthy goal. The acknowledgment of the All-One would lift him up, but polytheism becomes the grave of his humanity. The generation seemed incorrigible, and \u2014 destruction was its lot. Only one man, the father of a family, who walked before the All-One, sought righteousness, and elevated himself by governing sternly the animal in his nature, offered consolation in this destruction of the generation.

There came the time when, even in Israel, the prophet could lament \u2014 \"As the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.\" It became necessary to take away the abundance of earthly good, the wealth and the land, which had led it away from its mission; it was obliged to leave the happy soil which had seduced it from its allegiance to the Most High; nothing should be saved except the soul of its existence, the Torah; no other bond of unity should henceforth exist except \"God and its mission,\" which are indestructible, because spiritual.

No other sins had been committed in the Israel-state than appear in the life of other nations, but that which could be tolerated among others could not be excused in Israel; for its special office was to preserve itself pure from all sin and perversity, since \"\u05d4\" was its God. Destruction and misfortune are therefore no less instructive for Israel than prosperity. The dispersion opened a new, great, and wide-extended field for the fulfilment of its mission. But before the great wandering through the ages and the nations began, God gathered them again upon their home-soil, as a father, who is forced to send his children forth into the world, gathers them together in his house before their departure, to extend to them at once his parental blessing and his fond farewell. There, in their national home, they bound closer to themselves the Torah-bond which henceforth was alone to join them together. On the very eve of the exile, a branch left the parent tree, which was obliged to surrender largely the characteristics of the parent stem, in order to bring to the world, which had relapsed into polytheism, violence, immorality, and inhumanity, the tidings of the existence of the All-One and of the brotherhood of man and his superiority to the beast, and to proclaim the deliverance of mankind from the bondage of wealth-and-lust worship.

What a glorious resulting of our correspondence, dear Benjamin! But, when you conceive yourself exalted to the lofty summit of the idea of our mission and look upon the Law, which has as ostensible purpose the realization of this idea, you feel as though a yawning chasm intervened between you and it. You can not repress a feeling of sorrowing disapproval, a sensation of protesting wonderment when you think, that that is supposed to be the will of God ; nor do you see any real task, any ideal work to which you are called, nothing but praying and a passively-contemplative life, and in addition, unreasonable demands and senseless practices. But what would you say, dear friend, if I were to tell you that the excessive pressure of centuries in its accumulated weight had finally only permitted the rescue of the externals of the Law, but that the spirit had no longer found room? What if I were to say that Israel, banished from the society of the rest of mankind, estranged from the world and its life, had lost contact and sympathy with the world and life, and no longer considered them in comprehending and interpreting the Law, but deemed itself fortunate to have rescued even its, the Law's, externals? Suppose I were to tell you that a dull and prosaic dialectic had reduced to merest mummies laws full to overflowing of life and spirit, and that Israel, concerned and apprehensive because of the errors and evils which it had often seen follow the efforts of the uncontrolled intellect, had driven it away from the Law as one drives away a bird of prey from a dearly-beloved corpse? Centuries of oppression and misery, which offered no opportunity for activity, which made patient endurance and resignation the sole duties; when only prayer could give strength, and passive contemplation afforded the only consolation for the ills of life, must they not of necessity depress the spirit and compel the development of the narrow and restricted? If, furthermore, we say that the literary sources of Judaism, in which its spirit is contained, being misunderstood and misinterpreted, themselves aided in corporealizing and disguising the spirit; that a perverted intellect comprehended the institutions which were designed and ordained for the internal and external purification and betterment of man as mechanical, dynamical, or magical formulas for the upbuilding of higher worlds, and that thus the observances meant for the education of the spirit to a nobler life were but too frequently degraded into mere amuletic or talismanic performances; would you not admit, after all this, dear Benjamin, that you know only external Judaism, only an unrecognized, uncomprehended, misunderstood Judaism, and even that in a most fragmentary and incomplete form ?
