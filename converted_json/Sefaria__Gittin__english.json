Huna thereupon called upon a public orator, who discoursed as follows: 'This stumbling-block is under thy hand (Isaiah 3:6).  A man does not fully understand the words of the Torah until he has come to stumble over them.  Although they have said that if a man affiances half a woman she is not affianced, yet if one who is half a slave and half free is affianced, her betrothal is a genuine one. What is the reason [for the difference]? In the one case he leaves something over from his acquisition, in the other case he leaves nothing over from his acquisition.' But R. Sheshet [disagreed and] said: Just as if a man affiances half a woman she is not affianced, so if a woman who is half a slave and half free is affianced, her betrothal is not a genuine one.
