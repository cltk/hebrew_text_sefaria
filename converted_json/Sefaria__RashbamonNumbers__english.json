This is the reason why the Torah added the words: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d7\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, they remained in Chatzerot. <br> There is an allegorical Midrash in Sifrey at the end of this portion which is worth reading. Further on in 12,7 we are told that after the people had left Chatzerot they came to the desert of Paran and made camp there. This seems strange unless we assume that there had been two locations both with the name Chatzerot, a most unlikely scenario. My teachers were not clear how to answer my question, so that when I was once asked about this in Paris, I explained the apparent contradiction as follows: When the verse here tells us that the Israelites journeyed from Kivrot Hataavah to Chatzerot, adding that they remained there for a while, this is what the Sifrey meant when writing that they waited until Miriam was cured. [The thread of this story is taken up again in 12,16 with the Torah writing: \u201cand after the isolation period of Miriam was over the people resumed their journey from Chatzerot, making their next stop in the desert of Paran.\u201d The unusual feature of this story is that whereas normally the Torah writes \u05d5\u05d9\u05e1\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5, \u201cthey journeyed and they subsequently made camp,\u201d it being understood that the whole people journeyed, here the words \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd, \u201cthe people\u201d have been added for no apparent reason.<br> When the first \u201cflag\u201d journeyed, the Tabernacle had not yet been dismantled, so that G\u2019d calling to Aaron and Miriam suddenly to come to the Tabernacle, as reported in chapter 12,4 is not all that surprising. Seeing that Miriam subsequently was struck with tzoraat and the people had to wait with journeying (or volunteered to wait) until she had been cured, the first \u201cflag\u201d (three tribes) presumably turned back to join the mainstream and to wait there. After these seven days passed, this time around the whole people left Chatzerot again, so that the words \u201cthe people journeyed\u201d are eminently justified. I have found this whole Midrash in the Mechilta on Parshat Beshalach relating it to the first verse I have quoted above.<br> Furthermore, I have found in the responsa of Rabbi Klonimaus from Rome that he writes exactly as I have done. I have also explained the first verse in Beshalach in which the Israelites are portrayed as having moved from Raamses to Sukkot, as if this had been a few kilometers although its over 120 kilometers as understandable in terms of G\u2019d saying in Exodus 19,4 \u201cI carried you on eagles\u2019 wings.\u201d The first stage of the Israelites\u2019 journey from Raamses was indeed as if G\u2019d had transported them on a magic carpet."}, "4": {}, "5": {}, "6": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05df \u05db\u05d6\u05e8\u05e2 \u05d2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0, whereas its appearance was like that of crystals.

If so, why did G\u2019d become angry as we are told in verse 10?<br> Now the Torah explains the reason for G\u2019d\u2019s anger. When the people would grind the manna crystals in their mortars or mills, its taste was like something creamy, oily. This taste which originally had been described as similar to crackers smeared with honey (Exodus 15,31) changed to be like nuts after they are ground. After undergoing grinding it now became moist and like an oily substance. Seeing that it did not taste dry at all, the people\u2019s complaint was unfounded, and this is why G\u2019d became angry at the unjustified accusation that the manna was the reason that their whole system dried out. In Beshalach, where the taste is described as a wafer smeared with honey, the Torah spoke about what the manna tasted like raw, in its original state, prior to assuming the taste of rich cream."}, "7": {"0": "\u05dc\u05e9\u05d3, all of it the substance, no part of it refuse, waste.
