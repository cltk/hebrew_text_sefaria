For it is written: \u201cTill Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over whom You have made Your own\u201d (Exodus 15:16), And it [also] says: \u201cAs for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight.\u201d (Psalm 16:3.)  From where [do we infer that] the Sanctuary [is] one possession? For it is written: \u201cThe Sanctuary, O Lord, that Your hands have established\u201d (Exodus 15:17), And it is [also] said: \u201cAnd He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed.\u201d (Psalm 78:54.)"}}, "originalTitle": "\u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Pirkei Avot", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
