The Torah, at this stage, had covered up the change in Sarah's attitude toward Hagar. Sarai had become completely dependent on Hagar as a result of her having become pregnant. Previously, in the mistress-maid relationship it was the maid who had been dependent on her mistress. Avram had accused her of committing a criminal act by oppressing Hagar. By refusing her services as a maid, Hagar was further encouraged to treat her mistress as her inferior. As a result, Sarai now challenged Avram, blaming him for her reduction in status. She therefore demanded that G'd Himself intervene to show that it was really His will that she now be subordinate to Hagar. This is the reason for the dot on the word \u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05da. The point is that Sarai did not want such Divine judgment to cause Avram harm.

They had been looking forward to the fulfillment of this prophecy for all these years. We lost our independence due to our sins, however. G'd set a time of 1305 years (according to Daniel) until our redeemer would come. We must certainly continue to look forward to our glorious destiny and not despair if the Ishmaelites had not despaired after over 2000 years.

He considered himself a righteous person for not having sexually molested Sarah.

G\u2019d informed Yaakov that henceforth he would have two names, used alternatively.

What was meant was that henceforth the site of the Holy Ark would not be the exclusive site for the Presence of the Shechinah, but that the entire city of Jerusalem would have a similarly holy status. This is the meaning of: \u05d1\u05e2\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05db\u05e1\u05d0 \u05d4' \u201cat such a time they will refer to the city of Jerusalem as G\u2019d\u2019s throne\u201d (verse 17 in the above mentioned chapter in Jeremiah).

All these expressions are documented in Scripture.   The expression \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d3 (as here) occurs in Kings I 13,30 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e1\u05e4\u05d3\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9, \u201cthey lamented over it, saying: \u201calas\u201d my brother.\u201d The word \u05e0\u05d4\u05d9 meaning eulogy, appears in Jeremiah 9,18, whereas the expressions \u05e6\u05e2\u05e7\u05d4 and \u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc meaning different types of eulogy occur in Ezekiel 21,14. The expression \u05e0\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 occurs in Jeremiah 48,17 also meaning eulogy. The word \u05de\u05e8\u05d6\u05d7 is used in this sense in Jeremiah 16,5, whereas \u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd occurs in that sense Ezekiel 2,6. When the Torah here uses the expression \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d3 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc, a great mourning, the meaning is that the various types of eulogies to which we have referred were all used on that occasion.  Basically, the Torah teaches that nine different groups of people all participated in the funeral cortege for Yaakov and each made its particular contribution to eulogising and demonstrating their appreciation of the contribution this man had made to mankind, not only to his family. A eulogy is a register of the positive contributions made by the deceased during his lifetime. An example of such a eulogy are the words spoken about King Sha-ul and his son Yonathan by King David: in Samuel II 1,23: \u05d4\u05e0\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05e2\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05d5\u05d1\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d5, \u201cwho were beloved and pleasant and even in death refused to be parted from Him.\u201d A properly composed eulogy contains elements describing the personal relationship between the survivor and the deceased such as David saying of Yonathan in that same chapter: \u05e6\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05da \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05df, \u201cmy brother Yonathan you were most dear to me, your love was more wonderful to me, more than the love of women.\u201d King David also taught us something about a eulogy even for people who not always saw eye to eye with the one eulogising him, i.e Avner, at one time almost David\u2019s arch enemy. Nonetheless, in Samuel II 3,33 David proclaims: \u201cShould Avner have died the death of a churl? Your hands were not bound, your feet were not put in fetters; but you fell as one falls before treacherous men!\u201d These examples teach that when eulogising one has to list the good people did, their contributions to life generally, emphasising that with the death of the deceased the survivors have been deprived of those values the deceased stood for. The prophet Ezekiel was even instructed by G\u2019d to eulogise the city of Tzor (Tyre), (Ezekiel 27,2-3) although the major part of that eulogy bemoaned the abuse made by those people of the gifts and luxuries they had enjoyed thanks to G\u2019d\u2019s largesse. The exploits of these people are extolled in spite of their not finding favour in the eyes of the Lord. In verse 27 of that eulogy the fact that all these people, G\u2019d\u2019s creatures, were swept away in the prime of their lives is bemoaned. [The prophet Ezekiel did not say \u201cgood riddance.\u201d Ed.]  In Moed Katan the Talmud elaborates on the eulogy over the passing of Rabbi Pedot, the speaker commencing with describing the very day on which the sage died as a day which is difficult for the entire Jewish people, as difficult as the day when the sun set on the land of Egypt. This was a reference to Amos 8,9 \u201cShall not the earth shake for this, and all that dwell in it mourn? Shall it not all rise like the Nile, etc., etc.? I will make the sun set at noon, I will darken the earth on a sunny day, I will turn your festivals into mourning, and all your songs into dirges.\u201d The demise of the power of Egypt was, of course, no reason for the Jewish people to mourn, but it was a reason for all the nations who considered Egypt as their patron to do so. There is sort of a formula of how the president of the Sanhedrin has to be eulogised, [to ensure one is not guilty of being remiss in eulogising him sufficiently, a grave sin. Ed.] Part of the formula contains the words: \u201cthe finest spices have been buried in the earth (where they cannot give off their fragrance) a man who knew all about the most intricate parts of Torah law such as the various skin eczemas, etc. and ritual impurities connected with oholot, a man able to remove any doubts which bothered Torah scholars of lesser stature.

We have already explained that the noun \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd is a noun which is sometimes applied to G\u2019d, and sometimes to certain people, and sometimes to phenomena which some people worship even though they have nothing divine about them, In Genesis 1,1 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd, it is clearly a reference to G\u2019d. In Genesis 20,3 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05dc\u05da, it is a reference to an angel, seeing that he carried out a mission on behalf of G\u2019d. In Exodus 22,8 \u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd, it is a reference to a judge, a human being. The term is also applied to select human beings of a spiritually high level, such as when David quotes G\u2019d in Psalms 82,6 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05dd, I used to say that you (man) are \u201cdivine,\u201d (until you sinned). In our verse here, the Torah in speaking of \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd, refers to the elite of the human species at the time. In our verse it is a reference to the male elite, the judges."}, "2": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4, it is possible that G\u2019d extended their life spans for another 120 years, seeing the measure of their sin was not yet full. We have the Torah on record as the Emorites\u2019 measure of sin not being complete, and that as a result of this the Israelites could not yet dispossess them (Genesis 15,16).  Abusing one\u2019s G\u2019d given tzelem is something that cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. David already summed this up in Psalms 82,6 when he quoted G\u2019d as saying: \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05dd \u05d5\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05db\u05dc\u05db\u05dd, \u05d0\u05db\u05df \u05db\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5\u05df, \u201cI had said that you are all divine beings, sons of the most High; all of you, but you shall die as men do, etc.\u201d"}, "3": {"0": "\u05d4\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d1\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d4\u05dd \u05d5\u05d2\u05dd \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8 \u05db\u05df, the Torah informs us here that the people the spies reported seeing during their tour of the land of Canaan (Numbers 13,33) had been quite common in the period before the deluge. The words \u05d5\u05d2\u05dd \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05db\u05df mean that even after the deluge there continued to be such gigantic specimen of human beings.
