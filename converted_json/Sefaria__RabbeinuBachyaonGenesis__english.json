It need not even be mentioned that Israel in the wilderness knew this place through the forefathers, as the binding of Yitzchak took place there. In the Guide to the Perplexed (3, 45) the Rambam gave three explanations of why the text called it simply \u2018the place\u2019 and did not explicitly name it as Mount Moriah, famous and known to all. First - if the nations had known that there prayer is received and offerings find favor, each nation would have wanted to seize it, causing great struggle and bloodshed between the nations. Second \u2013 since the Canaanites dwelling in the land knew that in the future Israel would inherit their land and serve Gd and offer sacrifices in that place, they would have destroyed it to the extent that they could. Third \u2013 the tribes would have argued with each other, each one seeking that this place be included in his portion of the land. This would have cause dissention among them just as the desire for the priesthood did. Therefore the Torah hid this place and simply called it \u2018the place.\u2019 There is no need to mention that it was hidden from the nations, but rather even from Israel, because even though everyone knew the greatness of Mount Moriah they did not know that it was the place which the Lord would choose.", "1": "you shall inquire after His dwelling \u2013 You should seek His glory which dwells there.
