At the time of the engagement, he promised her 25,000 gold coins in a note and swore that he would not marry another woman in addition to her. The promissory note was deposited with a third party with instructions that if he violates his oath, she would be given the note.

On the contrary, it was discovered that she gave everything to her son.", "3": "Now Reuven wishes to marry someone else, to engage in procreation.", "4": "He says that he had sisters and had no way to marry them off; he married this woman so he would have money to marry off his sisters.

He married her for money and swore that he would not marry a second wife. He did not make the oath conditional. Rather, he swore straightforwardly. What wise man would attend to him, releasing him from his oath, when he swore to allay the woman\u2019s thoughts, so she would marry him? No wise man would release him.
