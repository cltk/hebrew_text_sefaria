Because of [the idea expressed in the verse]: '[God] has declared to His people the power of His works, in order to give them the heritage of the nations' (Psalms 111:6). Thus, should the nations of the world say to Israel: 'You are robbers, having conquered the lands of the seven [Canaanite] nations [by force],' [Israel] can say to them: 'The whole earth belongs to the Holy Blessed One; He created it and gave it to whomever He saw fit.

Add 48 years of Abraham\u2019s life and you have the 209. That was the year of the Dispersion. When Sodom was destroyed Abraham was 99 years old, so that from the Generation of the Dispersal (in the 48th year of Abraham\u2019s life) until this time was 52 years.

If you say that this cannot be correct on account of the \u05d0 in \u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05dd which is not a root letter in the word from which \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05df is derived (whilst in \u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05dd we have an \u05d0) then I would reply that we find some words which should have no \u05d0 at the beginning, but still \u05d0 is placed before them. Such are \u05d0\u05e0\u05da in (Amos 7:7) \u201ca wall made by a plumbline (\u05d0\u05e0\u05da)\u201d, where the word is of the same root as \u05e0\u05db\u05d4 in (2 Samuel 4:4) \u201cstricken (\u05e0\u05db\u05d4) in his feet\u201d, and \u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05da, a cruse containing anointing oil, in (2 Kings 4:2) \u201ca pot (\u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05da) of oil\u201d which is of the same root as \u05d5\u05e1\u05db\u05ea in (Ruth 3:3) \u201cwash thyself and (\u05d5\u05e1\u05db\u05ea) annoint thyself\u201d.", "1": "The \u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd (according to Onkelos) are owners of tents who spread about in all directions and travel about each in the \u201ctents of his palace\u201d (Rashi uses a Biblical phrase (Daniel 11:45), but he means nothing more than \u201ceach in his own tent\u201d).

Eleazar said in the name of R. Jos\u00e9 the son of Zimra: \u201cThis ladder stood in Beersheba and [the middle of]) its slope reached opposite the Temple\u201d (Genesis Rabbah 69). For Beersheba is situated in the South of Judah, Jerusalem in the North of it on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin and Bethel in the North of Benjamin\u2019s territory, on the border between the land of Benjamin and that of the children of Joseph. It follows, therefore, that a ladder whose foot is in Beersheba and whose top is in Bethel has the middle of its slope reaching opposite Jerusalem. Now as regards what our Rabbis stated (Chullin 91b) that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \u201cThis righteous man has came to the place where I dwell (i.e., the Temple at Jerusalem, whilst from here it is evident that he had come to Luz) and shall he depart without staying here over night?\u201d, and with regard to what they also said, (Pesachim 88a) \u201cJacob gave the name Bethel to Jerusalem\u201d, whereas this place which he called Bethel was Luz and not Jerusalem, whence did they learn to make this statement (which implies that Luz is identical with Jerusalem)? I say that Mount Moriah was forcibly removed from its locality and came hither (to Luz), and that this is what is meant by the \u201cshrinking\u201d of the ground that is mentioned in the Treatise (Chulin 91b) \u2014 that the site of the Temple came towards him (Jacob) as far as Bethel and this too is what is meant by \u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05d2\u05e2 \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd, \u201che lighted upon the place\u201d (i.e., he \u201cmet\u201d the place, as two people meet who are moving towards each other; cf. Rashi on Genesis 5:11). Now, since Jacob\u2019s route must have been from Beersheba to Jerusalem and thence to Luz and Haran and consequently when he reached Luz he had passed Jerusalem, if you should ask, \u201cWhen Jacob passed the Temple why did He not make him stop there?\u201d \u2014 If it never entered his mind to pray at the spot where his fathers had prayed should Heaven force him to stop there to do so? Really he had reached as far as Haran as we say in the Chapter \u05d2\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4 (Chulin 91b), and Scripture itself proves this since it states, \u201cAnd he went to Haran\u201d. When he arrived at Haran he said, \u201cIs it possible that I have passed the place where my fathers prayed without myself praying there?\u201d He decided to return and got as far as Bethel where the ground \"shrank\u201d for him. This Bethel is not the Bethel that is near Ai (cf. Genesis 12:8) but that which is near Jerusalem, and because he said of it, \u201cIt shall be the House of God\u201d, he called it Bethel. This, too, is Mount Moriah, where Abraham prayed, and it is also the field in which Isaac offered prayer as it is written, \u201c[Isaac went out] to meditate (i. e., to pray; cf. Genesis 24:63) in the field\u201d. Thus, too, do we read in the Treatise (Pesachim 88a) in a comment on the verse Micah 4:2: \u201c[O come ye and let us go up] to the mountain of the Lord (i.e. the mountain upon which the Temple is built) and to the house of the God of Jacob\u201d.

But the words are added to tell us that Ishmael died after he had betrothed her to Esau and before her marriage, and that her brother Nebaioth gave her away in marriage And we may learn, also, that Jacob was at that period sixty-three years old  For Ishmael was seventy-four years old when Jacob was born \u2014 since Ishmael was fourteen years older than Isaac, and Isaac was sixty when they (Jacob and Esau) were born, making seventy-four and his (Ishmael\u2019s) years were one hundred and thirty seven \u2014 as it is said (25:17) \u201cAnd these are the years of Ishmael etc.\u201d \u2014 consequently when Ishmael died Jacob was sixty-three years old. We learn from this that he (Jacob) concealed himself in Eber\u2019s School for fourteen years and only after that did he proceed to Haran. For before Joseph\u2019s birth he had stayed in Laban\u2019s house only fourteen years, as it is said (31:41) \u201cI served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock\u201d, and he received the sheep as wages only after Joseph was born, for it is said (30:25) \u201cAnd it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph etc. [that Jacob wished to leave Laban and he agreed to remain with him on condition of receiving certain sheep as wages]. Now Joseph was thirty years old when he became ruler in Egypt, and from then until the time that Jacob came down to Egypt was nine years \u2014 seven of plenty and two of famine \u2014 and Jacob then said to Pharaoh (47:9), \u201cThe days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years\u201d. Go and calculate: the fourteen years he passed with Laban before Joseph\u2019s birth, and the thirty years of Joseph\u2019s life before he became ruler and the nine years from when he became ruler until the time that Jacob came to Egypt make fifty three years from the time he joined Laban until the time he came to Egypt But when he parted from his father he was sixty-three years old, as shown above, so that you have 116 years as his age when he came to Egypt, on the assumption that the fifty-three years he spent with Laban etc. began immediately after he had left his father. But he (Jacob) himself said to Pharaoh, \u201c[I am] one hundred and thirty years\u201d. So you see that fourteen years are missing on this assumption. Thus you learn that after he had received the blessings he concealed himself in Eber\u2019 School for fourteen years. But he received no punishment for them (these fourteen years) on account of the merit of having studied the Torah in Eber\u2019s School during that period For Joseph was separated from his father only twenty-two years \u2014 that is, from the age of seventeen to that of thirty-nine - corresponding to the twenty-two years during which Jacob was separated from his father and could not perform the duty of honouring him (by actively attending to his needs), viz, the twenty years he spent in Laban's house and the two years he passed in travelling home - for it is written (33:17) with regard to his journey homewards, \"And Jacob built him a house and made booths for his cattle\", and our Rabbis, of blessed memory, inferred from this verse that during his travels he passed eighteen months at Succoth, since a house means a dwelling for the rainy season, and \"booths\" means for the summer time. And this statement that the study of the Torah protects one from punishment fits in with the calculation which we made above, based upon the Sacred Text, regarding the period from when he left his father until the time when he went down to Egypt at the age of 130 years, where we found a surplus of 14 years, so that he must have been absent from his father for 36 years. But we may regard it as certain that when on his journey to Laban he concealed himself in Eber's house it was for the purpose of studying the Torah with him and that because of the merit of studying the Torah he received no punishment for them (those fourteen years) so that Joseph was separated from him only twenty-two years \"measure for measure\".

Genesis 36:6) Esau\u2019s family consisted of only six (himself and his five sons), and Scripture calls them \u201cthe souls of his house\u201d (in the plural) and this is because they worshipped many gods (each serving a different god and having as it were, a different soul or religious feeling). But the family of Jacob when he came to Egypt consisted of seventy and Scripture calls them \u201csoul\u201d, in the singular, because they all served One God.

Should you say, however, that \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 has always two \u05d3\u2019s and these words have only one, the answer is: The word \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 is a noun and therefore requires two \u05d3\u2019s, for it is the way of a biliteral root to have the second letter doubled when used as a noun; the root proper, however, consists only of two letters. Thus it says, (Proverbs 26:2) \u05db\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05d3 \u201cthe wandering sparrow\u201d, (\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05d3 a verb, infinitive) of the same derivation as \u05e0\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd in (Job 7:4) \u201cI am full of \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd wanderings\u201d (a noun); (Judges 5:27) \u2018\u2018there he fell down (\u05e9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3) dead\u201d, a noun in meaning, which is of the same derivation as the verb in (Psalms 41:6) \u201cthat wasteth (\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d3) at moon-day\u201d. So, also, \u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05e0\u05d5 ,\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3 and \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 have the same derivation. When, also, one uses such biliteral roots in the future tense Kal, it (the second letter) is not doubled. For example:  \u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3 he will troop, \u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d3 he will wander, \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd he will be high, \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d3 he will devastate, \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 he will come back. When, however, such a root is used in a reflexive sense (Hithpael) or in a causative-transitive sense the second letter is doubled Examples are: \u05d9\u05ea\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3 ,\u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05dd ,\u05d9\u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc ,\u05d9\u05ea\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3. Examples of the causative-transitive sense are: (Psalms 146:9) \u201cHe strengtheneth (\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3) the fatherless and the widow\u201d; (Isaiah 49:5) \u201cTo bring Jacob back (\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1) to Him\u201d; (Isaiah 48:12) \u201cThe restorer (\u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1) of paths\u201d. The form \u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05e0\u05d5 which is used here has not the force that others will make him do something (i.e. it has not this causative-transitive sense with the direct accusative suffix \u05e0\u05d5\u05bc) but it means \u201ca troop will troop out from him\u201d, exactly the same as (Jeremiah 10:20) \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 which means \u201cmy children have gone forth from me\u201d, (as we might say \u201chave left me\u201d).

For you must needs admit that the \u201cseventh\u201d month when the Ark rested can only be counted from the time when the rain stopped, since the 40 days during which the rain fell and the 150 days during which the waters prevailed did not terminate until the first day of Sivan, and if you say that it means the seventh after the rain began to fall, this would not be Sivan. The \u201ctenth month\u201d, however, when the tops of the mountains became visible cannot possibly be counted except from the time the rain began to fall, for if you say that it must be calculated from the time when it stopped, which would be Elul, you would not then find that \u201cin the first month, on the first day of the month the waters dried up from off the earth\u201d (Genesis 8:13). For it was only at the end of 40 days after the tops of the mountains were visible that he sent forth the raven (Genesis 8:6), and he waited periods amounting altogether to 21 days during which he was sending forth the dove, making altogether 60 days from when the tops of the mountains became visible until when the face of the earth became dry; if, therefore, you say that it was in Elul that they were seen, it would follow that the earth became dry in Marcheshvan (60 days after Elul). But it (Scripture) calls it (the month when the waters were dried up; Genesis 5:13) the first month, and that can only be Tishri which is the first month reckoning according to the creation of the world \u2014 or according to R.
