This means that the enemies came to destroy everyone, men, women, and children, and there are those who say that the great miracle occurred through a woman. Her name was Judith, as the story goes, and she was the daughter of Yochanan, the high priest. She was extremely beautiful, and the Greek king wanted her to lay with him. She fed him a dish of cheese to make him thirsty, so that he would drink a great deal and became drunk, and recline and fall asleep. And it happened just that way, and once he was asleep, she took his sword and cut off his head. She brought his head to Jerusalem, and when the armies saw that their leader had been killed, they fled. For this reason, we have the custom of eating a cheese dish on Hannukah.", "5": "", "6": "", "7": "", "8": "", "9": ""}, "originalTitle": "\u05db\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Kolbo", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
