And what is the meaning of \"like Hashem our G-d whenever we call upon Him,\"--calling upon Him is by the festivals, as it is said, \"These are the festivals of Hashem, a holy calling.\" Rav Krispa said in the name of Rav Yochanan: in the past, these were the festivals of  Hashem; from now on, it is as you call them. If you call them, they are My festivals, and if not, they are not My festivals. \"This month is for you\"--you count according to it and the nations of the world do not count according to it. Rebbi said in the name of Rabi Yehuda bar Ilai: the way of the world is that the greater count according to the greater, and the smaller count according to the smaller. Eisav, who is greater, counts according to the sun, which is greater, and Yaakov, who is smaller, counts according to the moon, which is smaller. Rav Nachman said: it's a good sign; the greater one rules during the day and does not rule at night, so too the wicked Eisav rules in This World and does not rule in the World to Come. The smaller one rules by day and by night, so too Yaakov rules in This World and in the World to Come. Rav Nachman said: all the time that the light of the greater one shines, the light of the smaller one is not noticed; when the light of the greater one sets, the light of the smaller one is noticed. So too as long as the light of Eisav is shining, the light of Yaakov is not noticed; once Eisav's light sets, the light of Yaakov is noticed, as it is said: \"Arise and give light...\" This month [is the first of months:] Rav Shmuel bar Abba said, every month that is begun from six hours or less, the eye has power to see it. From six hours or more, eyes have no power to see it. And the month that Hashem said to Moshe [Nisan 2448] was begun from above six hours, and no eye could see it; but Hashem showed it to him with a finger and said to him, \"this month....\". Rav Acha said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani: the year that Yisrael left Egypt, the months of the year and the months of the period were equal. Rav Chiyya said in the name of Rav Yochanan: Hashem wrapped Himself in a talis with tzitzis and stood Moshe here and Aharon here, and called to Michael and Gavriel, and He made them as if they were the witnesses of the new moon. He said to them: how did you see the moon? Before the sun or after the sun? To its north or to its south?

This is what R\u2019 Yehudah meant when he said that the land of Canaan is good, but not the portion of the children of Reuven and Gad (which was on the east side of the Jordan river). this good mountain. This refers to Jerusalem. And the Lebanon. This refers to the Holy Temple, as it says \u201cOpen your doors, O Lebanon\u2026\u201d (Zechariah 11:1) There are those who say that the Lebanon refers to the appointing of a king. Pray let me cross over (e\u2019evrah nah) and see.

This refers to Jerusalem, as it says \u201c\u2026let us be sated with the goodness of Your house\u2026\u201d (Tehillim 65:5) The Lebanon. This refers to the Holy of Holies, as it says \u201cOpen your doors, O Lebanon\u2026\u201d (Zechariah 11:1) R\u2019 Simlai expounded: why did Moshe our teacher desire to enter into the land of Israel, did he need to eat its fruits or be sated from its goodness? Rather, this is what Moshe said \u2018I gave many commandments to Israel which cannot be fulfilled except in the land. I will go in in order that they all be fulfilled at my hands.\u2019 The Holy One said to him \u2018if all you are asking for is to receive the reward for these actions, I will consider it as if you had done all of these commandments, as it says \u201cTherefore, I will allot him a portion in public\u2026\u201d (Yeshayahu 53:12) I will give him his full reward.\u2019 Maybe you will say this is like the latter ones and not the earlier ones? The verse continues \u201c\u2026and with the strong he shall share plunder\u2026\u201d (ibid.) Like Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov who were strong in Torah and fulfilling commandments. \u201c\u2026because he poured out his soul to death\u2026\u201d (ibid.)

He gained atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf. \u201c\u2026and interceded for the transgressors.\u201d (ibid.) He pleaded for mercy on the behalf of the sinners in Israel that they should repent. Intercession (pegiya) refers to prayer, as its says \u201cAnd you, pray not on behalf of this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer, and entreat Me not for I will not hear you.\u201d (Yirmiyahu 7:16)"}, "816": {}, "817": {}, "818": {}, "819": {}, "82": {}, "820": {}, "821": {}, "822": {}, "823": {}, "824": {}, "825": {}, "826": {}, "827": {}, "828": {}, "829": {}, "83": {}, "830": {}, "831": {}, "832": {}, "833": {}, "834": {}, "835": {}, "836": {}, "837": {}, "838": {}, "839": {}, "84": {}, "840": {}, "841": {}, "842": {}, "843": {}, "844": {}, "845": {}, "846": {}, "847": {}, "848": {}, "849": {}, "85": {}, "850": {}, "851": {}, "852": {}, "853": {}, "854": {}, "855": {}, "856": {}, "857": {}, "858": {}, "859": {}, "86": {}, "860": {}, "861": {}, "862": {}, "863": {}, "864": {}, "865": {}, "866": {}, "867": {}, "868": {}, "869": {}, "87": {}, "870": {}, "871": {}, "872": {}, "873": {}, "874": {}, "875": {}, "876": {}, "877": {}, "878": {}, "879": {}, "88": {}, "880": {"0": 0, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": "... \u201cFor you have not yet come\u2026\u201d (Devarim 12:9) this was said in order to permit private altars between the \u2018resting place\u2019 and the \u2018inheritance\u2019, because the resting place refers to Shiloh and the inheritance is Jerusalem. Why did the verse mention them separately? To permit private altars between the two. Inheritance refers to Jerusalem, as its says \u201cMy inheritance was to Me like a lion in the forest\u2026\u201d (Yirmiyahu 12:8) and it says \u201cIs My inheritance to Me a speckled bird of prey?\u201d (Yirmiyahu 12:9) These are the words of R\u2019 Yehudah. R\u2019 Shimon says the resting place is Jerusalem and the inheritance is Shiloh, as it says \u201cThis is My resting place forever; here I shall dwell for I desired it,\u201d (Tehillim132:14) and it says \u201cFor the Lord has chosen Zion; He desired it for His habitation.\u201d (Tehillim 132:13) The opinion that the resting place is Shiloh makes sense, that is why the verse says \u2018to the resting place and to the inheritance.\u2019 But according to the opinion that says that the inheritance is Shiloh and the resting place Jerusalem, it should have said \u2018to the inheritance and to the resting place\u2019! That is a difficulty. The opinion that both refer to Shiloh makes sense, because \u2018the resting place\u2019 where they ceased from the conquest and \u2018the inheritance\u2019 where they divided tribal portions, as it is written \u201cAnd Yehoshua cast lots at Shiloh before the Lord; and there Yehoshua divided the land\u2026\u201d (Yehoshua 18:10) But according to the opinion that both refer to Jerusalem \u2018the inheritance\u2019 is the eternal inheritance, but \u2018the resting place\u2019\u2026? What does the resting refer to? The resting of the ark, as it is written \u201cAnd now, arise, O Lord God to Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your might\u2026\u201d (Divre HaYamim II 6:41) The opinion that both refer to Jerusalem makes sense, because while the Tabernacle was at Shiloh private altars were permitted, as it is written \u201cAnd Manoah took the kid goat and the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock to the Lord\u2026\u201d (Shoftim 13:19)  But the according to the opinion that both refer to Shiloh, then private altars were forbidden while the Tabernacle was there and how do we understand Manoah\u2019s act? It was a temporary injunction. The House of R\u2019 Yishmael taught like the opinion of R\u2019 Shimon bar Yochai that both refer to Jerusalem, and your sign is: one man pulled many to him\u2026"}, "89": {}, "9": {}, "90": {}, "91": {}, "92": {}, "93": {}, "94": {}, "95": {}, "96": {}, "97": {}, "98": {}, "99": {}}, "originalTitle": "\u05d9\u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Yalkut Shimoni on Torah", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
