[And similarly all drink that may be drunk in any vessel, if it is in an earthen vessel that is unclean, itself becomes unclean]. From this we learn several things: we learn that food is not fitted and liable to become unclean until water has once come upon it, and after water has once come on it it can any time after become unclean, and even after it has become dry; that wine and oil and anything which is termed \u05de\u05e9\u05e7\u05d4, liquid, (besides the three mentioned, also blood, milk, dew and honey of bees; cf. Mishna Machshirin 6:4) makes vegetation fitted to become unclean even as water does, for thus must the verse be expounded: any food upon which there cometh water or any liquid which may be drunk out of any vessel, that food shall become unclean. Further our Rabbis derive from here the law that a \u201csecondary uncleanness\u201d (\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4) cannot render \u201cvessels\u201d (a term used to denote anything except food and animate beings) unclean. For thus we read in a Boraitha (Pesachim 20a): One might think, since Scripture states v. 33: anything that is inside it shall be unclean, that all \u201cvessels\u201d that are placed inside an earthen vessel become unclean through the medium of the interior of an earthen vessel (i. e. because they are in contact with the earthen vessel which has itself become unclean through something unclean having been inside it)! It, however, says: all that is within it shall become unclean \u2026 of any food etc., \u2014 i.e., food [and liquids] may become unclean through the medium of the interior of an unclean earthen vessel, but no \u201cvessels\u201d can become unclean through the medium of the interior of an unclean earthen vessel. Now since a dead \u05e9\u05e8\u05e5, \u201creptile\u201d (which causes the uncleanness to the earthen vessel) is a primary source of uncleanness (\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4) and the object which has been rendered unclean by it (in this case the \u05db\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d7\u05e8\u05e1) is a secondary uncleanness (\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4), consequently we have the rule that the latter a secondary uncleanness \u2014 cannot in turn render unclean \u201cvessels\u201d which are in it. And we further learn from this (Pesachim 20a) that if a dead reptile (\u05e9\u05e8\u05e5) falls into the interior of an earthen oven in which there is bread, but the reptile does not come in contact with the bread, the oven becomes a secondary source of uncleanness of the first degree (\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4) and the bread one of the second degree (because the bread only becomes unclean through having come in contact with the oven which is only a secondary source of uncleanness of the first degree, and not a primary source): and we do not say that we regard the oven which contains the primary source as though it were full of uncleanness, and is itself a primary source, so that the bread should be a secondary uncleanness of the first degree (\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4), as though it had itself touched the primary source; for if you argue so, then any article which is in an earthen vessel is not excluded from becoming unclean through the medium of its interior (whilst we have just stated that \u201cvessels\u201d are excluded \u2014 that in such a case they do not become unclean), because you see, if we assume that the whole interior is full of a primary source of uncleanness, it would be as though this uncleanness itself has touched them (the objects) on their outside and then the objects would indeed have become unclean: we, however, have stated that in such a case they do not become unclean; therefore we do not assume that the primary source of uncleanness fills the whole interior: the bread therefore receives the uncleanness not from the carcass but from the oven and is thus a secondary uncleanness of the second degree which does not further transfer its uncleanness to things which have no sacred character. \u2014 And we further learn (Chullin 118b; cf. Sifra) in regard to the \u201ccoming of water\u201d, that this does not render vegetation fitted to become unclean unless it falls upon them after they have been plucked; because if you say that they (the vegetation) can acquire this fitness whilst still attached to the soil, then the law has no significance at all, for you have no growing vegetation upon which water does not fall at some time or other, and what, then, is the sense of Scripture saying, \u201cupon which water cometh\u201d? \u2014 And we further learn (Yoma 80a) that articles of food which are unclean do not render other food unclean unless the former contains at least a volume equal to that of an egg, for it says: \u201c[food] which may be eaten\u201d, i.e. food which may be eaten at one time, and our Rabbis calculated that the gullet does not hold more than a hen\u2019s egg (Sifra; cf. also Yoma 80a)."}, "34": {"0": "\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05db\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd OVEN OR RANGES FOR POTS \u2014 These are movable objects, and they are of earthenware, they have an interior and one places the pot over the opening of the hollow space (the cavity); both have their openings on top.

These words, \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea and \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea, although not properly applicable to garments are used here to afford an opportunity for an Halachic derivation, for which there is required an argument deduced from the similarity of phrases: Whence do we know in regard to a plague spreading over the entire surface in the case of garments that it is c1ean? Because the, terms \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea and \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea are used in the case of a human being and the terms \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea and \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea are used in the case of garments. How is it in the former case? If it has spread over all his body, he is clean (v.13)! So here, also, if it has spread over all the garment it is clean (Nidda 19a). For this reason Scripture here purposely avails itself of the expressions \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea and \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea, to make the \u05d2\u05d6\"\u05e9 possible. And in regard to its interpretation and its translation in the Targum the following is what it implies: \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea is an expression denoting \u201cold\u201d, and \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea is an expression denoting \u201cnew\u201d; and the meaning is just the same as though it were written \u05d1\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5. at its end or at its beginning, \u2014 for \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea has the meaning of the back- parts (i. e. the end), since \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea has the meaning of face (front-side, i. e. beginning), as it is written, (v. 41) \u201cAnd if from the corner towards his face [the hair of his head be fallen] \u2026 he is a \u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u201d \u2014 so that \u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea must be all that part which slopes downwards on the skull towards the back.

Scripture declares the recurring plague unclean although it has not spread (Leviticus 13:55)! Similarly, here, it declares the recurring plague unclean even though it has not spread. But if this be so, why does it state here \u201cand, behold. [the plague] hath spread\"? As a matter of fact this is not the proper place of the verse), and the statement \u201che shall pull down the house\u201d (v. 45) it ought to have written immediately after (v. 43), \u201cand if the plague return\u201d). The words in v. 44, \u201che shall look, and, behold, if the plague hath spread\u201d, consequently only intend to tell us something about a plague which has remained in the same condition during the first week, and to which he (the priest) comes at the end of the second week and finds that it has spread, for Scripture has not explained anything at all about the case where the plague remains in the same condition during the first week. (It speaks in v. 39 only of when the plague has spread during the first week.) It tells us here (in the section which speaks about what happens a week after the house has been scraped etc., i. e. after the end of the second week) the law regarding it by mention of this spreading (i. e. by the words \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4) which can only speak of the case that it remained in the same condition during the first week, and has spread during the second week. Now what shall he do with it? One might think that he must demolish it, even as it states immediately after it, (v. 45) \u201cHe shall break down the house\u201d. It, however, states, (v. 39) \u201cif the priest returneth\u201d at the end of the week and finds that it has spread, and (v. 44) \u201cand if the priest cometh\u201d at the end of the second week and now finds that for the first time it has spread \u2014 thus we may learn what is to be done after this \u201ccoming\" from what happens after that \u201creturning\u201d! What is the law in the case of that \u201creturning\u201d? He must remove the stones, scrape and re-plaster (vv. 40\u201442), and give it another week! Similarly, here, in the case of this \u201ccoming\u201d after a second week, he must remove the stones, scrape and re-plaster and give it a further week! If it recurs he must demolish the house: if it does not recur, the house is clean. And whence may we infer that if it remained in the same condition both during this week (the first) and that (the second), he must remove the stones, scrape and re-plaster, and give it another week (just as he did when it spread in the second week, as we have just stated)? Because it states, (v. 44) \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u201dand if [the priest] cometh\u201d, and (v. 48) \u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u201cand if [the priest] cometh\u201d, the expression \u201ccoming\u201d being used in each case to indicate an analogy between them, the reasoning being as follows: About what can this verse 48 which refers to the plague not having spread be speaking? If you say it speaks of a plague which has spread during the first week but did not spread during the second week, behold, this has already been mentioned (vv. 39\u201443, and second half of v. 44)! If you say that it speaks of a plague which has spread during the second week but has not spread during the first week, behold, this has already been mentioned (v. 44 according to Rashi's explanation above). Consequently it can only be saying the words \u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0, \u201cif having come once (\u05d1\u05d0), he cometh again (\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0)\u201d, about one who comes at the end of the first week and comes again at the end of the second week, \u201cand, behold, [the plague] had not spread\u201d in either instance. In the case of such a plague which remains as it was during two successive weeks, what shall he do to it? One might think he departs and gets himself off without doing anything more because the house is clean, since it states here (immediately afterwards), \u201che shall pronounce the house clean\u201d. It, however, states, \u201cif the plague is healed\u201d, \u2014 which implies that Scripture says as it were: I do declare clean only the plague which is healed (i. e. when something has been done by which it is removed). What, then, shall he do to it? The reply is: above (v. 44) it has spoken of \u201ccoming\u201d, and further on (v. 48) it also speaks of \u201ccoming\u201d. What is the law in the previous case? He removes the stones, scrapes and re-plasters and gives it another week \u2014 for, as we have stated above, we have it as tradition that \u201creturn\u201d (v. 39: \u05d5\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df) and \u201ccoming\u201d (v. 44: \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df) are identical in regard to their law; similarly, too, must be done in the later case (v. 48 which as we have proved, must be speaking of \u05e2\u05de\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05d5\u05d1\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 etc.), as it is stated in Torath Cohanim. The conclusion of the matter is: Demolishing a house takes place only in the case of a plague that recurs after removal of the stones, scraping and re-plastering, and such a recurring plague does not require that it should also have spread in order to make it necessary to demolish the house. The sequence of the verses is as follows: \u201cIf it returns\u201d (v. 48), \u201che shall break down\u201d (v. 45), \u201cBut if one cometh\u201d (v. 46) \u201c[And he that lieth in the house] \u2026 and he that eateth in the house\u201d (v. 47), and only then v. 44: \u201cAnd if the priest come and look, and, behold, the plague hath spread\u201d; \u2014 and the last verse speaks, as shown above, of the case of a plague that remained as it was during the first week to which one has therefore given a second week for being shut up, and at the end of the second week he comes and sees it that it has spread. And what shall he do to it? He removes the stones, scrapes and re-plasters and gives it another week. If it returns he demolishes the house, if it does not return, it is clean and requires two birds for purification, but this third week is the utmost time for investigation, for not more than three weeks are to be spent in the investigation of plagues."}, "44": {}, "45": {"0": "\u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 [AND HE THAT COMES INTO THE HOUSE] ALL THE DAYS THAT IT IS SHUT UP [SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVENING] \u2014 \"the days that it is shut up\", but not during the days in which he had scraped the plague-spot (for through the scraping the uncleanness has, at least for the time being, departed, and the house is only closed again for investigation). I might think that I may also exclude from this law the house that is decidedly unclean through a recurring plague and which must be demolished from which one has scraped the plague-spot (but which has not yet been demolished, for we might assume that for the time being the uncleanness is departed)!

I might think that his garments do not become unclean even if, after coming into the house, he remained there long enough to eat a half-loaf (an ordinary meal, equal in mass to 4 eggs)! It, however, states, (v. 47) \"And he that eateth in the house shall wash his garments\", for we may reason as follows: I have here only the law regarding one who actually eats. Whence may I derive that this applies also to one who sleeps in the house? Because Scripture states \"and he who sleeps [shall wash his garments]\". Now I have only the law regarding one who eats and regarding one who sleeps in the house; whence may I derive that the same law applies to one who neither eats nor sleeps (but merely stays in the house)? Because it states \u200e\u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05e1 \u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05e1 (twice) in v. 47 where it could have written: \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05db\u05d1 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05db\u05dc \u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05e1 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5, and such wording would imply that only those who actually sleep and eat in the house must wash their garments. By the insertion of the first \u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05e1 we have two coordinated sentences of similar import and this suggests that sleeping and eating are merely examples of cases where garments would require washing. Thus the use of the first \u05d9\u05db\u05d1\u05e1 serves to include besides one who sleeps and one who eats in the house anyone who stays there. If this be so (i. e. if it means that the garments of anyone who stays in the house become unclean) why does it expressly mention one who eats and one who sleeps? Let it merely state: one who stays in the house shall wash his garments, when these also would be included! But this is done in order to designate for him who sleeps in the house (i. e. who does anything in the house beyond entering and immediately leaving it, as is mentioned in v. 46) a minimum period of time the stay during which renders his garments unclean, viz., a time long enough to eat a half-loaf (cf. Sifra)."}, "46": {}, "47": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 AND IF [THE PRIEST] SHALL COME IN at the end of the second week,", "1": "\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 AND LOOK UPON IT, AND, BEHOLD, THE PLAGUE HATH NOT SPREAD \u2026 [THEN THE PRIEST SHALL PRONOUNCE THE HOUSE CLEAN].\u2014 This verse, as shown above, is intended to teach the law regarding the case that it (the plague) has stayed as it was during both the first week and the second week.

Examples are: the phrase here, \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05dc\u05da \u05e8\u05db\u05d9\u05dc; (Jeremiah 6:28) \"[They are all] walking as spies: they are brass and iron\". But as for any other expressions for \u201cslander\u201d, the verb \u05d4\u05dc\u05da is not used with them. Examples are (Psalms 101:5) \"whoso privily slandereth his neighbour\u201d; (Psalms 120:2) \"false tongue\"; (Psalms 12:4) \"the tongue that speaketh proud things (slander)\". For this reason I say that this expression (\u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05da \u05e8\u05db\u05d9\u05dc) means \"going about \u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc, and spying out\u201d (\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc = \u05e8\u05db\u05dc), because the \u05db may interchange with ,\u05d2 since all letters the pronounciation of which are of the same place in the organs of speech may interchange with each other e. g., \u05d1\u05d9\"\u05ea with \u05d2\u05d9\u05de\"\u05dc ,\u05e4\"\u05d0 with \u05db\"\u05e3 or with \u05e0\u05d5\"\u05df ;\u05e7\u05d5\"\u05e3 with \u05d6\u05d9\"\u05df ;\u05dc\u05de\"\u05d3 with \u05e6\u05d3\"\u05d9. And in a similar sense we have, (II Samuel 19:28) \"He spied against thy servant [to my lord]\u201d which implies, \"he spied me out with subtly in order to speak evil about me to my lord\u05f4 (and thus \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc comes to mean \"to slander\u201d). Similar is (Psalms 15:8): \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e8\u05d2\u05dc \u05e2\u05dc \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 which means, \"he has not spied out in order to have evil on his tongue\u201d. Similarly the \u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05dc, the trader, is one who goes round and searches for (spies out) all kinds of merchandise, and so also the seller of perfumes which women use to make themselves nice, because he constantly goes about in the villages, he is called \u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05dc, which has the same meaning as \u05e8\u05d5\u05d2\u05dc.

He made the propagation of the human race possible through this union), as it is said (Psalms 89:3) \"The world was built up through \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3, loving-kindness\" (Sifra; Sanhedrin 58b)."}, "17": {"0": "\u05d4\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 means HE HATH UNCOVERED.

Rashi on Leviticus 12:4). And our Rabbis derived it (the fact that \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d2\u05e2 means: she shall not eat) from a verbal analogy. It is indeed impossible to say that one is punishable for touching holy things in a state of uncleanness, because the penalty of excision for eating holy things in such a state is mentioned in the section commencing \u05e6\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df (Leviticus 7:20, 21) \u2014 twice is the punishment of \u05db\u05e8\u05ea mentioned there, one immediately after the other; and if one really becomes liable to punishment for the mere touching of holy things it is unnecessary to pronounce him liable to punishment for eating them! In this sense also is it (our passage) expounded in Torath Cohanim: But is a priest who merely touches holy things when he is unclean really liable to the punishment of excision? Surely not, since Scripture expressly states in the following verse that an unclean priest who eats of the holy things is liable to excision and this latter statement would be unnecessary since eating without touching is impossible. But if this be so, why does Scripture use the term \u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 and not  \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc which means \"eating\u201d?

You must needs admit that from what is implied in it (in the phrase) you must learn that Scripture is speaking of one whose state of uncleanness can fly (pass) away therefrom (since the phrase implies: \u201cwhilst the \u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4 is still present\", presupposing that there is a possibility of the \u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4 passing away), and this can only refer to a human being who has a means of purification through immersion in a ritual bath whilst unclean food can never again become clean (Sifra; Zevachim 43b).", "2": "\u05d5\u05e0\u05db\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4  [THAT SOUL] SHALL BE CUT OFF \u2014 I might think that this implies merely that he will be removed from one region (lit., side) to another region \u2014 that he will be cut off from his native place but may settle down in another place!

The law speaks only of smiting resulting in a wound! \u2014 for if there is no wound resulting no compensation can be claimed \u2014 so, too, he who smites his father is not liable to the death penalty unless he inflicts a wound upon him (Sifra; Sanhedrin 84a, 85b)."}, "21": {"0": "\u200e'\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dd I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD \u2014 your God \u2014 the God of all of you.

Were not all commandments given on Sinai? But this statement is intended to suggest the following comparison: How is it in the case of the law of Shemittah? Its general rules, [its specific prescriptions] and minute details were ordained on Mount Sinai! So, also, were all commandments with their general rules and their minute details ordained on Mount Sinai. Thus is in taught in Torath Cohanim. It seems to me that the following is the explanation of this: Since we do not find in Deuteronomy that the law concerning \u201cthe rest of the soil in the Sabbatical year\u201d was repeated in \u201cthe fields of Moab\u201d (cf. Deuteronomy 34:1; the place where Moses repeated many of the commandments contained in the other books of the Pentateuch), we may infer that all its general rules and specific prescriptions must have been promulgated on Sinai. The express mention of \u05d1\u05d4\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 here appears therefore to be unnecessary but Scripture by mentioning it intends to teach regarding every Divine command (lit., Divine utterance) that was spoken to Moses that in every case they, their general rules and minute details originated at Sinai and that they were only repeated again in \u201cthe fields of Moab\u201d."}, "1": {"0": "\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u05f3 [THEN SHALL THE LAND KEEP) A REST \u200e'\u05dc\u05d4\u200e \u2014 This means a rest in honor of the Lord (not a rest for the Lord, as in v. 4: \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05df \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5, \u201cthere shall be a strict Sabbath for the land\u201d, i. e. for the land to rest) in the same sense as these words are used in the case of the weekly Sabbath (lit., the Sabbath of Creation) (Exodus 20:10) where '\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u200e cannot mean \u201ca day for God to rest\u201d."}, "10": {"0": "\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e9\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 IT IS A JUBILEE; THE FIFTIETH YEAR [SHALL BE UNTO YOU A PERIOD etc.] \u2014 Why is this statement made at all?

Consequently if there are only a few years until the Jubilee and this man sells it at a high price it follows that the purchaser has been overreached. If, on the other hand, there are still many years until the Jubilee so that he eats from it many crops the seller is overreached if you give him only a low price. It must therefore be purchased according to the period remaining until the Jubilee. That is what Scripture means when it states: \u201cAccording to the number of the years of the fruits he shall sell unto  ,\"theei. e. according to the number of years of crops that it (the field) will remain in the hand of the purchaser you shall sell it to him. Our Rabbis, however, derived from here the law that one who sells his field has no right to repurchase it before the elapse of at least two years, \u2014 that it must remain in the possession of the purchaser two full years reckoning from date to date, and even though there may be three crops in these two years, as, for instance, if he sold it when it had its corn standing. And in this interpretation the word \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 does not lose its literal meaning, viz., that of years, (the words \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea are not taken in this interpretation to mean \u201ctwo crops\u201d as you might at first think) \u2014 the phrase means \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea the number of years of crops (i. e. \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 is the construct of \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd) and not of years when the corn is smitten by blast, and you know that the minimum number implied in the plural \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd is two (this is how the Rabbis derived the law that the vendor must leave the field at least two years in possession of the purchaser)."}, "15": {"0": "\u05ea\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 \u05de\u05e7\u05e0\u05ea\u05d5 THOU SHALT INCREASE THE PRICE THEREOF \u2014 i. e. you may sell it at a high price ", "1": "\u05ea\u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05d8 \u05de\u05e7\u05e0\u05ea\u05d5 \u2014 You shall offer a lower price."}, "16": {"0": "\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5 YE SHALL NOT THEREFORE BE EXTORTIONATE TO ONE ANOTHER \u2014 Here Scripture warns against vexing by words (wounding a person\u2019s feelings) \u2014 that one should  not annoy his fellow-man, nor give him an advice which is unfitted for him, but is in accordance with the plan and the advantage of the adviser.

Indeed all these sections (these of the whole Sedrah) are stated in the sequence in which the incidents to which they refer actually occur. First Scripiure warns the people about the seventh year's produce (not to do trade in them). If, however, one is covetous of money and brings himself under the constant suspicion of trading in the seventh-year fruits, he will at some time have to sell his movable property on account of his destitution. It is for this reason that Scripture put in juxtaposition to it (the\u201cAnd when you make a sale [to your fellow-Jew]\u201d (25:14)  \u201cor make a purchase from the hand\u2026,\u201d something that is transferred from hand to hand). If he still does not repent, he will eventually have to sell his inheritance (25:25). If he even then does not repent, he will eventually have to sell his home, and if even then, he does not repent, he will eventually have to borrow money with interest (verses 25:35-38). Now, the later the scenario in this passage, the more severe it is [i.e., first he sells his belongings, then his property, then his home and then even borrowing with interest which is more severe than selling one\u2019s property; (Nachalath Ya\u2019akov) thus, the passage continues accordingly, for] if he still does not repent, he will eventually have to sell himself [to his fellow Jew as a servant] (verses 25:39-46); and [finally,] if he has still not repented, not enough that he had to be sold to his fellow Jew - but he will [be forced to sell himself] even to a non-Jew!", "1": "\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05df \u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05ea (a kind of mosaic pavement) \u2014 The word \u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05ea is an expression denoting \u201ccovering\u201d, similar to the verb in (Exodus 33:22) \u201cI will cover thee (\u05d5\u05e9\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9) with my hand\u201d.

The root \u05d2\u05e2\u05dc wherever it occurs denotes the casting out (as though spewing) or something that has been absorbed in another substance. In a similar sense the verb is used in (II Samuel 1:21) \u201cFor there the shield of the mighty was \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05dc, [the shield of Saul, as though it had never been anointed with oil]\u201d, i. e. it did not show itself receptive to being anointed, but ejected, as it were, the oily substance with which it had been smeared; for they used to smear leather shields with boiled fat in order to make the blow of the arrow or the spear glide off, so that it should not penetrate the leather. (Thus, when two things have been in the closest association, the term \u05d2\u05e2\u05dc may be used of that which finally discards the other.

I will, as it were, empty out the scabbard \u2014 pour forth the sword from it, and it shall never return, but always follow you) (Sifra).", "2": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05db\u05dd \u05e9\u05de\u05de\u05d4 AND YOUR LAND WILL BE (REMAIN) DESOLATE \u2014 This implies that you will not soon return unto it, and on that account \u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05db\u05dd \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 YOUR CITIES WILL BE WASTE, i. e. they will seem to you waste; for when a man is exiled from his house, or from his vineyard, or from his city, knowing that he is ultimately to return to it, it appears to him as though his vineyard or his house were not waste.  \u2014Thus is it explained in Torath Cohanim."}, "33": {"0": "\u05d0\u05d6 \u05ea\u05e8\u05e6\u05d4 means: then the land shall appease the wrath of the Omnipresent who was angry because of the neglect of the Sabbatical years.", "1": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8\u05e6\u05ea \u2014 means, it will give satisfaction to the King as regards its Sabbatical years."}, "34": {"0": "\u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 \u2014 The word \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 expresses the idea of something being done (passive infinitive; here Hophal); and the \u05de has a Dagesh in place of doubling that letter in the root \u05e9\u05de\u05dd.", "1": "\u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4  BECAUSE IT DID NOT REST [IN YOUR SABBATHS] \u2014 The seventy years of the Babylonian exile exactly corresponded to the seventy Sabbatical and Jubilee years that were due in those years when Israel was provoking the anger of the Omnipresent  whilststill in their land, i. e. in 430 years. Three hundred and ninety were their years of sin from the time they entered the Land until the Ten Tribes went into exile. The people of the Kingdom of Judah provoked Him still another forty years, \u2014 from the exile of the Ten Tribes until the destruction of Jerusalem (in the days of king Jehoiachin; cf. 2 Kings 24:10 ff.). It is this that is mentioned in the case of Ezekiel (4:4\u20146): \u201cMoreover lie thou upon thy left, [and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days\u2026]. And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days [each day for a year have I appointed it unto thee]\u201d. This prophecy was spoken to Ezekiel in the fifth year of king Jeoiachin\u2019s captivity (cf. Ezekiel 1:2). They spent another six years in the Land until Zedekiah (the last king, who reigned eleven years) went into exile; thus you have altogether forty-six years. \u2014 And if you say \u201cBut this period must have covered more than forty-six years because the years of the reign of Manasseh (the son of Hezekiah during whose reign the Ten Tribes became exiled), were alone 55 years, and there followed other kings also until the destruction of the Temple!\u201d Then I reply that Manasseh lived in a state of repentence 33 years of these and that the years of his wickedness with which alone we are concerned were only twenty-two, as it is said, (2 Kings 21:3) \u201cFor he (Manasseh)\u2026 made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel\u201d, and Ahab reigned 22 years, just as they (the Rabbis) stated (i. e. they stated that this comparison of Manasseh with Ahab shows that the latter was wicked for 22 years only) in the chapter Chelek (Sanhedrin 103a). Then we have the years of his successor, Amon, two; eleven of Jehoiakin, and a similar number of Zedekiah, the last king of Judah \u2014 altogether 46 years. Now, go and calculate for four hundred and thirty-six years the number of Sabbatical and Jubilee periods contained in them and you will find that they are sixteen for every hundred years, viz., fourteen Sabbatical periods and two Jubilee-periods; so for four hundred years there are sixty-four. For the remaining thirty-six there are five Sabbatical periods, making seventy less one. There is yet one year over (the thirty-sixth, since five Sabbatical periods give only thirty-five years) which entered into (began) the Sabbatical period and which completes seventy such periods, each terminating in a Sabbatical year. And because of them (i. e. because of the neglect of these seventy years) exactly seventy years of exile were decreed against them. Thus, too, it is said in Chronicles, (II Chronicles 36:21) \u201c[and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon\u2026] until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths [for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbaths] to fulfill three score and ten years\u201d (Seder Olam)."}, "35": {"0": "\u05d5\u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05e8\u05da AND I WILL SEND A FAINTNESS [INTO THEIR HEART] \u2014  \u05de\u05e8\u05da\u200e means timidity and faint-heartedness.

If, on the other hand, being only of moderate means, he has set apart money only for a tenth of an ephah of flour, but became rich afterwards, he must add to it and bring the offering prescribed for a rich man.

Jos\u00e9 said, \u201cIf you wish to know the reward prepared for the righteous, go and learn from the case of Adam Horishon, who was charged only with a negative command (not to eat from the \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea) and who transgressed it, \u2014 see how many kinds of death-penalties were on this account decreed as a punishment against himself and all his descendants! Now, which measure is greater, \u2014 that of good (of reward), or that of punishment? You must admit that it is that of reward (cf. Rashi on Exodus 20:6). If, then, the measure of punishment is the lesser, consider that if so many kinds of death-penalties were decreed as a punishment against himself and his descendants, surely, in the case of the measure of good which is the greater one, if a person refrains from eating sacrifices which have become abominable (\u05e4\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc) or which have been left over beyond the prescribed time (\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8), or if he fasts on Yom Kippur, how much the more certain is it that he will acquire merit for himself and for his descendants and the descendants of his descendants until the end of all generations! \u2014 R. Akiba said, \u201cSee, it states, (Deuteronomy 19:15) \u201cat the mouth of two witnesses, or, at the mouth of three witnesses [shall the matter be established]. \u2014 But if evidence can be established by two witnesses, why does Scripture afterwards specifically state that this may be done by three? But it is to bring the third witness under the law there stated \u2014 to be severe with him and to make his sentence exactly like that of these (the first two witnesses) in respect to punishment in case of \u201cplotting\u201d (evidence that is rebutted by proof that the witness was not present on the occasion to which he has testified; see Rashi on Deuteronomy 19:16). Now, if Scripture exacts punishment so severely from one who has only joined himself with sinners (he is so described because as a single witness he could not hope that his evidence would be effective), just as it does from the sinners themselves, how much the more certain is it that He will give a reward to him who attaches himself to those who practise meritorious deeds just as it does to those who themselves practise meritorious deeds! (Sanhedrin 9a; Makkot 5b). \u2014 R. Eleazar b. Azariah said: In Deuteronomy (24:19) Scripture states, \u201cWhen thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgotten a sheaf in the field, [thou shalt not return to take it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless etc.]\u201d, and, you see, it states immediately afterwards: \u201cthat the Lord thy God may bless thee etc.\u201d Scripture (God) thus gives the assurance of a blessing to one through whom a meritorious deed came about (the feeding of the stranger, etc.), without himself knowing about it (since he forgot to remove the sheaf from the field)! You must now admit that if a Sela was tied up in the skirt of one\u2019s garment and it fell from it and a poor man finds it and supports himself by it the Holy One, blessed be He gives the assurance of a blessing to him (to the man who has lost the Sela) (Sifra)."}, "17": {"0": "\u200e \u05dc\u05d0\u05e9\u05dd  \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05da  [HE SHALL BRING A RAM \u2026] ACCORDING TO THE VALUATION FOR A GUILT OFFERING \u2014 i. e. according to the value stated above (v. 15, viz., at least 2 shekels).", "1": "\u200e\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u200e \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d0\u200e\u200e \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d2\u05d2  [AND THE PRIEST SHALL MAKE EXPIATION FOR HIM CONCERNING HIS ERROR] WHEREIN HE ERRED AND DISCOVERED IT NOT \u2014 Consequently if it came to his knowledge after a time that he has sinned, he is not atoned for by this guilt-offering which he has already bought, but remains unatoned until he brings a sin-offering.

To instruct him regarding the incense ceremony. Or it may be that he entered for some other reason?! See, I draw a conclusion: the descent from the altar and the entry into the tent of meeting both required to be accompanied by a benediction, as stated in vv. 22 and 23 (and consequently both were, in a measure, of similar character). Now what was the descent from the altar? It was of the nature (it look place in connection with) a sacrificial act! So, also, the entry into the tent took place in connection with a sacrificial act! Thus you may learn: Why did Moses enter with Aaron? To instruct him regarding the incense ceremony which was the only rite performed on that day within the tent! (Cf. Jerusalem Talmud Taanit ch. 4). Another explanation is: When Aaron perceived that all the sacrifices had been offered and all the rites performed, and yet the Shechinah had not descended for Israel, since the heavenly fire had not fallen to consume the sacrifice, he was uneasy in mind and said: I feel certain that the Holy One, blessed be He, is angry with me and that it is on my account that the Shechinah has not descended for Israel. He therefore said to Moses: \u201cMy brother Moses! Do you act thus with me: you know that I have entered into this matter at your bidding and yet I have been put to shame! Moses at once entered the tent with him and they offered prayer and the Shechinah descended for Israel (Sifra).", "1": "\u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05dd AND THEY CAME OUT AND BLESSED THE PEOPLE \u2014 They said the words that conclude \u201cThe Prayer of Moses\u201d (Psalms 90:17): \u201cMay the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us\u201d \u2014 i. e.

All the trouble which we have taken was only that the Shechinah may dwell amongst us, so that we may know that the sin of the golden calf has been atoned for on our behalf!\u201d He therefore had said to them (v. 6): \u201cThis is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do so that the glory of the Lord may appear unto you\u201d (i. e. only after these offerings will have been brought by Aaron (cf. v. 7) will God\u2019s glory appear unto you).
