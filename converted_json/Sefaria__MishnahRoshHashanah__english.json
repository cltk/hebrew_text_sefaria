As to their saying that they had seen it in the morning in the east, he assumed that they had been deceived by having seen clouds in the form of the moon in the firmament.

Gamliel counters in the baraitha: \"Thus have I received it from my father's father's house: Sometimes it comes longer; sometimes it comes shorter.\" That is, the time between the molad and the appearance of the moon is not always the same. For sometimes the movement of the moon is faster, and, sometimes, slower. And by the speed of the moon's movement at that time, R. Gamliel calculated that the moon could have been seen on that night, for which reason he accepted their testimony.] On another occasion, two witnesses came and testified: \"We saw it in its (regular) time [the night of the thirtieth], but it was not visible on the night of its fullness\" [the night of the thirty-first], and R. Gamliel accepted their testimony. [Not because he assumed that the moon moved away from the sun on the night of the thirtieth, so as to be visible, and then turned back towards the sun on the night of the thirty-first, so that it was concealed. For the moon does not turn back, but moves continuously in its orbit. Rather, R. Gamliel knew by calculation that on that night when the witnesses claimed to have seen it, the moon had already moved far enough from the sun to be visible, for which reason he accepted their testimony. As to their saying: \"but it was not visible on the night of its fullness,\" it is possible that it had been covered by the clouds or that they could not see it because of some other reason.] R.

(2:7): \"The head of beth-din says: 'It is sanctified'\"] \u2014 still, the witnesses were not required to go [to him, but] only to the (regular) meeting place [of the Sanhedrin, and they would sanctify it without the head of beth-din.]", "4": "\tThe order of blessings (on Rosh Hashanah): He says avoth [magen Avraham], and gevuroth [atah gibor], and kedushath Hashem [kadosh, kadosh], and he includes malchuyoth with them. And he does not blow. (He says) kedushath hayom [atah bechartanu], and he blows; zichronoth, and he blows; shofroth, and he blows. [These are derived from verses: It is written (Leviticus 23:24): \"zichron teruah,\" which our sages expounded: \"zichron\" \u2014 these are \"zichronoth\"; \"teruah\" \u2014 these are \"shofroth.\" And it is written (Numbers 10:10): \"And they shall be to you as a memorial before your G-d; I am the L-rd your G-d.\" Why mention \"I am the L-rd your G-d\"? It is intended as a prototype, viz.: Wherever zichronoth (\"memorials\") and shofroth are recited (as they are on Rosh Hashanah - \"zichron teruah\"), malchuyoth (acknowledgments of G-d's reign) are to be recited along with them.] And he says avodah (retzeh), and hoda'ah (modim), and birchath Cohanim. These are the words of R. Yochanan b. Nuri. R. Akiva said to him: If he does not blow for malchuyoth, why does he mention (them)? Rather, he says avoth, gevuroth, and kedushath Hashem; and he includes malchuyoth with kedushath hayom and he blows; zichronoth, and he blows; shofroth, and he blows. And he says avodah, hoda'ah, and birchath Cohanim. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.]", "5": "\tOne is to recite no fewer than ten (verses) of malchuyoth: [three from the Torah, three from Prophets, three from the Writings, and a concluding verse from the Torah], (no fewer than) ten zichronoth, and ten shofroth. R. Yochanan b. Nuri says: If he recited three of each, [one of Torah, one of Prophets, one of Writings], he has fulfilled his obligation. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Yochanan b. Nuri.] One does not recite zichronoth, malchuyoth, and shofroth of adversity, [such as (Ezekiel 20:33): \"Surely, with a strong hand \u2026 shall I reign over you,\" (Psalms 78:39): \"And He remembered that they were but flesh,\" (Hosea 5:8): \"Blow the shofar in Giveah,\" and the like. And zichronoth relating to individuals (as opposed to those relating to the populace in general), like (Nechemiah 5:19): \"Remember me, O my G-d, for good,\" even though they are for the good, are not to be recited. And this is the halachah.] R. Yossi says: If he concludes with (verses in) the Torah, he has fulfilled his obligation. [The gemara explains: He concludes in Torah; but if he concludes in Prophets, he has fulfilled his obligation. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.]", "6": "\tThe prayer leader on the yom tov of Rosh Hashanah \u2014 the second officiates at the blowing of the shofar [i.e., The prayer leader at mussaf officiates at the shofar blowing, and not the shacharith prayer leader. This was instituted at a time of shmad (enforced conversion), when they decreed against blowing the shofar and lay in wait for them all six hours of the time of the shacharith prayer, whereupon they moved the shofar blowing from shacharith to mussaf.]; and at the time of Hallel, the first officiates at the Hallel. [Because Hallel is not recited on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we have \"and at the time of Hallel\"; that is, on the other festivals, when Hallel is recited.]", "7": "\tThe shofar of Rosh Hashanah \u2014 the tchum is not crossed for it [i.e., It is forbidden to go outside the tchum in order to bring a shofar or to go to hear the blowing], and a mound (that has fallen on it) is not dug up (to extract it). It is forbidden to climb a tree, to ride an animal, or to swim (for its sake). And it may not be cut, both with something interdicted because of shvuth (\"resting\") [such as a knife] or with something which is interdicted by negative commandment, [as with a saw, which is an absolute labor in woodworking. Some understand it in the opposite manner: \"something interdicted by reason of shvuth\" \u2014 a sickle, which it is not the practice to cut (objects) with. \"something interdicted by negative commandment\" \u2014 a knife, which is used for cutting.] But if he wishes to put water or wine therein, he may do so, [and we do not say that he is amending an object thereby.] We do not stop the children [who have reached the age of chinuch (mitzvah training)] from blowing it [even on Shabbath, in order to train them for mitzvoth, that they gain practice in blowing for the yom tov of Rosh Hashanah], and one may (even) practice with them. [And there is no reason to decree lest he come to carry it four cubits in the public domain, for he is not preoccupied with a mitzvah, but just practicing, and they decreed lest he come to carry it four cubits in the public domain only at a time when he was obligated in the blowing of shofar, when, being preoccupied with fulfilling his obligation, he might forget the Sabbath.] And one who (merely) practices (blowing the shofar) does not fulfill his obligation. And one who hears from one who practices does not fulfill his obligation.", "8": "\tThe order of blowing: Three, [one for malchuyoth, one for zichronoth, one for shofroth], of three each [tekiah, teruah, tekiah for each one. For two teruoth are mentioned in respect to Rosh Hashanah and one in respect to Yom Kippur of the Jubilee, and we derive by identity, \"seventh\"-\"seventh,\" that what is stated in respect to one we apply to the other. So that \"teruah\" mentioned in respect to the Yom Kippur of the Jubilee, we apply to Rosh Hashanah, leaving us with three teruoth for Rosh Hashanah. And the two teruoth mentioned in respect to Rosh Hashanah, we apply to Yom Kippur, leaving us with three teruoth for Yom Kippur. And every teruah (broken blast) has a plain blast (tekiah) before it and after it. As it was taught (29b): \"Whence is it derived that there is a plain blast before it (the teruah)? From (Leviticus 25:9): \"And you shall cause to pass a shofar of teruah?\" And whence is it derived that there is a plain blast after it? From (Ibid.): \"shall you cause to pass a shofar\" \u2014 \"passing\" before and after, and teruah in the middle. \"passing\" connotes a plain blast, the \"passing\" of a single, plain sound. So that for the three teruoth of Rosh Hashanah, there are six tekioth \u2014 thus, \"three of three each.\"] The length of the tekiah [i.e., the length of all the tekioth, six in number] is three teruoth, [so that the length of a tekiah is half a teruah.] The length of a teruah is three yevavoth [three short notes. Some explain that each yevavah is three short blasts in succession, so that the length of a teruah is nine short blasts in succession. And this stands more to reason.] If he blew a [regular] tekiah before [the teruah] and he extended the second [the tekiah after the teruah] as two, to fulfill the requirement of two tekioth one after the other \u2014 the tekiah following malchuyoth and that preceding zichronoth], he has produced only one (tekiah), [a tekiah not being divided in two]. If he blessed [i.e., if he recited the mussaf prayer and the nine blessings], and then a shofar became available to him, he blows tekiah, teruah, tekiah, three times. Just as the prayer leader is obligated, [both in the blessings of Rosh Hashanah and those of the entire year, and fulfills his obligation only with the prayer which he prays for himself, so every individual who is versed in the prayers fulfills his obligation only with his own praying, both on Rosh Hashanah and on the other days of the year. The only purpose of the prayer leader is to effect the fulfillment of the obligation for those who are not thus versed.] R. Gamliel says: The prayer leader effects the fulfillment of the obligation for the (entire) populace, [whether they be versed or unversed, both in the blessings of Rosh Hashanah and in the prayers of the entire year. Why, then, does the congregation pray in silence? So that the prayer leader can arrange his prayer. The halachah is in accordance with the sages in respect to the prayers of the entire year, that the prayer leader effects fulfillment of obligation only for the unversed. But with the blessings of Rosh Hashanah and the Yom Kippur of Jubilee, which are nine long blessings, which not all are versed in, the halachah is in accordance with R. Gamliel, that just as the prayer leader effects fulfillment of obligation for the unversed, so he fulfills it for the versed.]"}}, "originalTitle": "\u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Mishnah Rosh Hashanah", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
