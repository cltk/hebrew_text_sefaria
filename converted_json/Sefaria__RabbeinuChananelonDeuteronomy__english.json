Ed.]<br> The translation of the long benediction is as follows: (after the customary introductory formula) \u201cWho has sanctified the fetus in the womb of his mother, and Who after completion of forty days of pregnancy furnished the fetus with 248 limbs and blew into him a living soul, as per Genesis 2,7 \u2018He blew into his nose a living soul, so that man became a living creature.\u2019 He covered the limbs with skin and tendons, as we know from Job 10,11-12, and commanded food for the fetus consisting out of milk and honey for him to enjoy. He arranged for two angels to protect him while within his mother\u2019s womb, something we also know from these verses in Job, Job commending G\u2019d for having watched over his spirit while in his mother\u2019s womb.\u201d<br> Following these benedictions by the priest, the father of the baby recites the following: \u201cthis is my firstborn son, and I have been commanded to redeem him in Exodus 13,13. May it be the will of the Lord our G\u2019d that just as You have given his father the opportunity to redeem him, so you will grant him the opportunity to bring him to the studying of Torah, the marriage canopy, and the performance of good deeds.\u201d He concludes with the benediction \u201cWho sanctifies the firstborn of His people Israel through their being redeemed.\u201d At that point the priest receives the silver coins and places them over the head of the baby, saying: \u201cthis in lieu of this, this as an exchange for this; this has been given secular status by means of this. May this one enter into a realm of life of Torah and reverence for Heaven.\u201d The priest then places his hand on top of the baby and recites the well known priestly blessing (Numbers 6,24), followed by a wish for the baby to enjoy long life taken from Proverbs 3,2, as well as other verses in the same vein."}}, "2": {}, "3": {}, "4": {}, "5": {}, "6": {}, "7": {}, "8": {}, "9": {}}, "originalTitle": "\u05e8' \u05d7\u05e0\u05e0\u05d0\u05dc \u05e2\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd", "source": "Sefaria", "englishTitle": "Rabbeinu Chananel on Deuteronomy", "author": "Not available", "sourceLink": "http://www.sefaria.org/"}
